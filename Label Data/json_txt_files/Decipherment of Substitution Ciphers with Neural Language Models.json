Previous work using pretrained language models (LMs) for decipherment use n-gram LMs (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Nuhn et al., 2013). Some methods use the ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm (Knight et al., 2006) while most state-of-the-art approaches for decipherment of 1:1 and homophonic substitution ciphers use beam search and rely on the clever use of n-gram LMs (Nuhn et al., 2014; Hauer et al., 2014). Neural LMs globally score the entire candidate plaintext sequence (Mikolov et al., 2010). However, using a neural LM for decipherment is not trivial because scoring the entire candidate partially deciphered plaintext is computationally challenging. We solve both of these problems in this paper and provide an improved beam search based decipherment algorithm for homophonic ciphers that exploits pre-trained neural LMs for the first time."}, {"heading": "2 Decipherment Model", "text": "We use the notation from Nuhn et al. (2013). Ciphertext fN1 = f1..fi..fN and plaintext e N 1 = e1..ei..eN consist of vocabularies fi \u2208 Vf and ei \u2208 Ve respectively. The beginning tokens in the ciphertext (f0) and plaintext (e0) are set to \u201c$\u201d denoting the beginning of a sentence. The substitutions are represented by a function \u03c6 : Vf \u2192 Ve such that 1:1 substitutions are bijective while homophonic substitutions are general. A cipher function \u03c6which does not have every \u03c6(f) fixed is called a partial cipher function (Corlett and Penn, 2010). The number of fs that are fixed in \u03c6 is given by its cardinality. \u03c6\u2032 is called an extension of \u03c6, if f is fixed in \u03c6\u2032 such that \u03b4(\u03c6\u2032(f), \u03c6(f)) yields true \u2200f \u2208 Vf which are already fixed in \u03c6 where \u03b4 is Kronecker delta. Decipherment is then the task of finding the \u03c6 for which the probability of the deciphered text is maximized.\n\u03c6\u0302 = argmax \u03c6 p(\u03c6(f1)...\u03c6(fN )) (1)\nwhere p(.) is the language model (LM). Finding this argmax is solved using a beam search algorithm (Nuhn et al., 2013) which incrementally finds the most likely substitutions using the language model scores as the ranking."}, {"heading": "2.1 Neural Language Model", "text": "The advantage of a neural LM is that it can be used to score the entire candidate plaintext for a hypothesized partial decipherment.

An improved version of rest cost es-\ntimation (Nuhn et al., 2014) consults lower order n-grams to score each position."}, {"heading": "3.2 Global Rest Cost Estimation", "text": "The baseline scoring method greatly relies on local context, i.e. the estimation is strictly based on partial character sequences. Since this depends solely on the n-gram LM, the true conditional probability under Markov assumption is not modeled and, therefore, context dependency beyond the window of (n\u2212 1) is ignored. Thus, attempting to utilize a higher amount of context can lower the probability of some tokens resulting in poor scores.\nWe address this issue with a new improved version of the rest cost estimator by supplementing the partial decipherment \u03c6(fN1 ) with predicted plaintext text symbols using our neural language model (NLM). Applying \u03c6 = {(a,A), (b, B))} to the ciphertext above, we get the following partial hypothesis: \u03c6(fN1 ) = $a1b2...a6b7..a10..a13b14..$ We introduce a scoring function that is able to score the entire plaintext including the missing plaintext symbols. First, we sample1 the plaintext symbols from the NLM at all locations depending on the deciphered tokens from the partial hypothesis \u03c6 such that these tokens maintain their respective positions in the sequence, and at the same time are sampled from the neural LM to fit (probabilistically) in this context. Next, we determine the probability of the entire sequence including the scores of sampled plaintext as our rest cost estimate.\nNLM\nIn our running example, this would yield a score estimation of the partial decipherment, \u03c6(fN1 ) :\n\u03c6(fN1 ) = $ a1b2d3c4c5a6b7c8d9a10d11d12a13b14d15c16 $\nThus, the neural LM is used to predict the score of the full sequence.

Since more terms participate in the rest cost estimation with global context, we use the plaintext LM to provide us with a better rest cost in the beam search."}, {"heading": "3.3 Frequency Matching Heuristic", "text": "Alignment by frequency similarity (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000) assumes that two forms belong to the same lemma when their relative frequency fits the expected distribution.

The closer this value to 0, the more likely it is that f is mapped to e.\nThus given a \u03c6 with the SCORE(\u03c6), the extension \u03c6\u2032 (Algo. 1) is scored as: SCORE(\u03c6\u2032) = SCORE(\u03c6) + NEW(\u03c6\u2032)\u2212 FMH(\u03c6\u2032) (4) where NEW is the score for symbols that have been newly fixed in \u03c6\u2032 while extending \u03c6 to \u03c6\u2032. Our experimental evaluations show that the global rest cost estimator and the frequency matching heuristic contribute positively towards the accuracy of different ciphertexts."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental Evaluation", "text": "We carry out 2 sets of experiments: one on letter based 1:1, and another on homophonic substitution ciphers.

Nuhn et al. (2013) produce better results in faster time compared to ILP and EM-based decipherment methods by employing a higher order language model and an iterative beam search algorithm. Nuhn et al. (2014) present various improvements to the beam search algorithm in Nuhn et al. (2013) including improved rest cost estimation and an optimized strategy for ordering decipherment of the cipher symbols. Hauer et al. (2014) propose a novel approach for solving mono-alphabetic substitution ciphers which combines character-level and word-level language model. They formulate decipherment as a tree search problem, and use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as an alternative to beam search. Their approach is the best for short ciphers.\nGreydanus (2017) frames the decryption process as a sequence-to-sequence translation task and uses a deep LSTM-based model to learn the decryption algorithms for three polyalphabetic ciphers including the Enigma cipher. However, this approach needs supervision compared to our approach which uses a pre-trained neural LM. Gomez et al. (2018) (CipherGAN) use a generative adversarial network to learn the mapping between the learned letter embedding distributions in the ciphertext and plaintext. They apply this approach to shift ciphers (including Vigene\u0300re ciphers). Their approach cannot be extended to homophonic ciphers and full message neural LMs as in our work."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first application of large pre-trained neural LMs to the decipherment problem. We modify the beam search algorithm for decipherment from Nuhn et al.
