0	27	People pursue multiple conversational goals in dialog (Tracy and Coupland, 1990).
1	48	Contributions to a conversation can be divided into those that fulfill propositional functions, contributing informational content to the dialog; those that fulfill interactional functions, managing the conversational interaction; and those that fulfill interpersonal functions, managing the relationship between the interlocutors (Cassell and Bickmore, 2003; Fetzer, 2013).
5	77	As naturalistic interactions with dialog systems increasingly become a part of people’s daily lives, it is important for these systems to advance their capabilities of not only conveying information and achieving smooth interaction, but also managing long-term relationships with people by building intimacy (Pecune et al., 2013) and rapport (Zhao et al., 2014), not just for the sake of companionship, but as an intrinsic part of successfully fulfilling collaborative tasks.
11	26	(Spencer-Oatey, 2008) also posits that over time, interlocutors intend to increase coordination by adhering to behavior expectations, which are guided by sociocultural norms in the initial stages of interaction and by interpersonally determined norms afterwards.
13	21	Meanwhile, in the increasing trajectory of interpersonal closeness, referring to shared experience allows interlocutors to increase coordination by indexing common history and differentiating in-group and out-group individuals (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) (cementing the sense that the two are part of a group in ways that similar phenomena such as ”referring to shared interests” do not appear to).
45	31	Prior work demonstrates that peer tutoring is an effective paradigm that results in student learning (Sharpley et al., 1983), making this an effective context to study dyadic interaction with a concrete task outcome.
53	37	We coded for two sub-categories: (1) revealing the long-term aspects of oneself that one may feel are deep and true (e.g, “I love my pets”), (2) revealing one’s transgressive (forbidden or sociallyunacceptable) behaviors or actions, which may be a way of attempting to make the interlocutor feel better by disclosing one’s flaws (e.g, “I suck at linear equations”).
54	23	Referring to Shared Experience (SE): We differentiate between shared experience - an experience that the two interlocutors engage in or share with one another at the same time (such as ”that facebook post Cecily posted last week was wild!”) - from shared interests (such as ”you like Xbox games too?).
57	20	Praise (PR): We annotated both labeled praise (an expression of a positive evaluation of a specific attribute, behavior or product of the other; e.g, “great job with those negative numbers”), and unlabeled praise (a generic expression of positive evaluation, without a specific target;e.g, “Perfect”).
60	31	In a second pass, if a social norm violation, we differentiated: (1) breaking the conversational rules of the experiment (e.g. off-task talk during tutoring session, insulting the experimenter or the experiment, etc); (2) face threatening acts (e.g. criticizing, teasing, or insulting, etc); (3) referring to one’s own or the other person’s social norm violations or general social norm violations (e.g. referring to the need to get back to focusing on work, or to the other person being verbally annoying etc).
66	56	We coded (1) Gaze at the partner (gP), (2) Gaze at one’s own worksheet (gO), (3) Gaze at partner’s worksheet (gN), (4) Gaze elsewhere (gE).
80	97	Third, for visual behaviors like smile, eye gaze, head nod, we binarized these features by denoting their presence (1) or absence (0) in one clause.
91	21	Reference to shared experience: We looked at three LIWC categories: (1) Affiliation drive, which comprises words signaling a need to affiliate such as ally, friend, social etc (d=0.92), (2) Time Orientation words, which capture past (mostly in ROE) , present (mostly in RIE) and future focus and comprises words such as ago, did, talked, today, is, now, may, will, soon etc (d=0.95).
94	52	Praise: We looked at positive emotions (d=2.55), since praise is one form of verbal persuasion that increases the interlocutor’s confidence and boosts self efficacy (Bandura, 1994).
97	20	Social norm violation: We looked at different categories of off-task talk from LIWC, such as social processes comprising words related to friends, family, male and female references (d=0.78), biological processes comprising words belonging to the categories of body, health etc (d=0.30) and personal concerns (d=0.24).
101	32	In our qualitative analysis of social norm violation utterances, we had discovered interactions of students to be reflective of need for power, meaning attention to or awareness of relative status in a social setting (perhaps this could be a result of putting one student in the tutor role).
103	46	Finally, based on prior work (Kacewicz et al., 2009) that found increased use of first-person plural to be a good predictor of higher status, and increased use of first-person singular to be a good predictor of lower status, we posited that when students violated social norms, they were more likely to freely make statements that involved others.
108	23	By using Open Smile (Eyben et al., 2010), we extracted two sets of basic features - for loudness features, pcm-loudness and its delta coefficient were tested; for pitch-based features, jitterLocal, jitterDDP, shimmerLocal, F0final and also their delta coefficients were tested.
115	26	Despite often becoming excited when disclosing things that they loved or liked, sometimes students also seemed to hesitate and spoke at a lower pitch when they revealed a transgressive act.
121	31	Social norm violation: We found high effect sizes for pcm-loudness-sma-amean (d=0.72) and F0final-sma-amean (d=0.61) and interestingly, negative effect sizes for jitter (d=-0.09) and shimmer (d=-0.16).
122	21	One potential reason could be that when student violate social norms, their behaviors are likely to become outliers compared to their normative behaviors.
147	21	The top features from feature set f1 predictive of speakers disclosing themselves included gazing at partner (0.44), head nodding (0.24) and not gazing at their own worksheet (-0.60) or the interlocutor’s worksheet (-0.21).
150	21	The top features from feature set f2 predictive of speakers disclosing included listener behaviors such as head nodding (0.3) to communicate their attention (Schegloff, 1982), gazing elsewhere (0.12) or at the speaker (0.09) instead of gazing at their own worksheet (-0.89) or the speaker’s worksheet (- 0.27).
153	20	The top features from feature set f1 predictive of speakers referring to shared experience included not gazing at own worksheet (-0.66), partner’s worksheet (-0.40) or at the partner (-0.22), no smiling (-0.18) and having lower shimmer in voice (-0.26).
155	20	The top features from feature set f2 predictive of speakers using shared experience included listener behaviors such as smiling (0.53) perhaps to indicate appreciation towards the content of the talk, or encourage the speaker to go on (Niewiadomski et al., 2010).
159	28	The top features from feature set f1 predictive of speakers using praise included gazing at partner’s worksheet (0.68) indicative of directing attention to the partner’s (perhaps the tutee’s) work, smiling (0.51), perhaps to mitigate the potential embarassment of praise (Niewiadomski et al., 2010) and head nodding (0.35) with a positive tone of voice (0.04), perhaps to emphasize the praise.
170	20	This becomes especially important as automatic behavioral analysis increasingly develops new real-time metrics to predict other kinds of conversational strategies related to interpersonal dynamics like politeness, sarcasm etc, that are not easily captured by observer-based labeling.
203	20	We have also begun to use the social conversational strategies described here to complement the curriculum script in a traditional tutoring dialogue comprising knowledge-telling or knowledge-building utterances, shallow or deep question asking, hints and other forms of feedback.
206	39	It is conceivable that contemporary corpus-based approaches to NLG that introduce stylistic variation into a dialog (Wen et al., 2015) may one day learn on the user’s own conversational style, and entrain to it.
207	37	In a system like that, real-time recognition of conversational strategies like that demonstrated here could play an essential role.
