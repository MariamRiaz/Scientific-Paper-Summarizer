{"sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "One of the most wide-spread techniques for sketching graph-structured data is coarsening. As with most sketching methods, instead of solving a large graph problem in its native domain, coarsening involves solving an akin problem of reduced size at a lower cost; the solution can then be inexpensively lifted and refined in the native domain.\nThe benefits of coarsening are well known both in the algorithmic and machine learning communities. There exists a long list of algorithms that utilize it for partitioning (Hendrickson & Leland, 1995; Karypis & Kumar, 1998a; Kushnir et al., 2006; Dhillon et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2014) and visualizing (Koren, 2002; Walshaw, 2006) large graphs in a computationally efficient manner. In addition, it has been frequently used to create multi-scale representations of graph-structured data, such as coarse-grained diffusion maps (Lafon & Lee, 2006), multi-scale wavelets (Gavish et al., 2010) and pyramids (Shuman et al., 2016).\nMore recently, coarsening is employed as a component of graph convolutional networks analogous to pooling (Bruna\n1E\u0301cole Polytechnique Fe\u0301de\u0301rale Lausanne, Switzerland.

Combining the values of adjacent vertices reduces the spatial size of each layer\u2019s output, prevents overfitting, and encourages a hierarchical scaling of representations.\nYet, much remains to be understood about the properties and limitations of graph coarsening.\nThe majority of theoretical work has so far focused on constructing fast linear solvers using multigrid techniques. These methods are especially relevant for approximating the solution of differential equations on grids and finiteelement meshes. Multigrids were also adapted to arbitrary graphs by Koutis et al. (2011) and later on by Livne and Brandt (2012). Based on an optimized version of the Galerkin coarsening, the authors demonstrate an algebraic multi-level approximation scheme that is numerically shown to solve symmetric diagonally dominant linear systems in almost linear time. Similar techniques have also been applied for approximating the Fiedler vector (Urschel et al., 2014; Gandhi, 2016) and solving least-squares problems (Hirani et al., 2015; Colley et al., 2017).\nDespite this progress, with the exception of certain interlacing results (Chung, 1997; Chen et al., 2004), it is currently an open question how coarsening affects the spectrum of a general graph. As a consequence, there is no rigorous way of determining to what extend one may coarsen a graph without significantly affecting the performance of spectral methods for graph partitioning and visualization. The absence of a fundamental understanding of what and how much information is lost also hinders our ability to design efficient learning algorithms for graph-structured data: e.g., coarsening is the least studied (and less optimized) component of graph convolutional networks.\nThis paper sheds light into some of these questions. Specifically, we consider a one-shot coarsening operation and ask how much it affects the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Key to our argument is the introduced restricted spectral similarity (RSS) property, asserting that the Laplacian of the coarsened and actual graphs behave similarly (up to some constants) with respect to an appropriate set of vectors. The RSS property is shown to hold for coarsenings constructed by contracting the edges contained in a randomized matching. Moreover, the attained\nconstants depend on the degree distribution and can be controlled by the ratio of the coarsened and actual graph sizes, i.e., the extend of dimensionality reduction.\nWe utilize the RSS property to provide spectrum approximation guarantees. It is proven that the principal eigenvalues and eigenspaces of the coarsened and actual Laplacian matrices are close when the RSS constants are not too large. Our results carry implications for non-linear methods for data clustering (Von Luxburg, 2007) and dimensionality reduction (Belkin & Niyogi, 2003). A case in point is spectral clustering: we show that lifted eigenvectors can be used to produce clustering assignments of good quality even without refinement. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally (Karypis & Kumar, 1998a; Dhillon et al., 2007), but up to now lacked formal justification.\nPaper organization. After introducing the RSS property in Section 2, we demonstrate in Section 3 how to generate coarsenings featuring small RSS constants. Sections 4 and 5 then link our results to spectrum preservation and spectral clustering, respectively. The paper concludes by briefly discussing the limitations of our analysis. The proofs can be found in a supplementary document."}, {"heading": "2.

How to coarsen a graph?", "text": "At the heart of a coarsening lies a surjective (and therefore dimension reducing) mapping \u03d5 : V \u2192 Vc between the original vertex set V = {v1, . . . , vN} and the smaller vertex set Vc = {v\u20321, . . . , v\u2032n}. In other words, the coarse graph Gc = (Vc, Ec) has m = |Ec| and contains every edge (i, j) \u2208 E for which \u03d5(vi) 6= \u03d5(vj). We define the coarsened Laplacian as\nLc = CLC >, (2)\nwhere the fat n \u00d7 N coarsening matrix C describes how different v \u2208 V are mapped onto the vertex set Vc. Similarly, we may downsample a vector x \u2208 RN supported on V by the linear transformation\nxc = Cx, (3)\nwhere now xc \u2208 Rn. We here focus on coarsenings where each vertex vi is mapped into a single v\u2032j . This is equivalent to only considering coarsening matrices with block-diagonal form C = blkdiag ( c>1 , . . . , c > n ) , where each c>j = [cj(1), . . . , cj(nj)] is the length nj coarsening weight vector associated with the j-th vertex v\u2032j of Vc. In addition, we restrict our attention to constant coarsening weight vectors of unit norm \u2016cj\u20162 = 1 with entries equal to n\u2212\n1/2 j .\nThough Lc is not a proper combinatorial Laplacian matrix (e.g., Lc1 6= 0 for 1 being the all ones vector), it can take the proper form using the simple re-normalization QLcQ, where Q = diag(C1). This might seem inconvenient at a first glance. We argue that it is not: it should not be the action of Lc in itself that matters, but its effect when combined with downsampling. When acting on xc, the desired nullspace property is regained since LcC1 = 0. Alternatively, one could define Lc\u2032 = QCLC>Q and xc\u2032 = Q\n\u22121Cx, where now Lc\u2032 has the proper combinatorial Laplacian form. This construction however is equivalent to the one we consider here since x>c Lcxc = x>C>Q\u22121QCLC>QQ\u22121Cx = x>c\u2032Lc\u2032xc\u2032 .\nWe will also utilize the notion of a coarsening frame:\nDefinition 1 (Coarsening frame). The coarsening frame GF = (VF , EF ,WF ) is the subgraph of G induced by set VF = {vi | \u2203vj with \u03d5(vi) = \u03d5(vj)}.\nInformally, GF is the subgraph of G that is coarsened (see Figure 1c). We say that the coarsening corresponds to an edge contraction if no two edges of the coarsening frame are themselves adjacent\u2014in other words, EF forms a matching on G.\nLifting. We write x\u0303 = C>xc to do an approximate inverse mapping from Vc to V , effectively lifting the dimension from Rn back to RN . To motivate this choice notice that, even though \u03a0 = C>C is not an identity matrix, it is block diagonal \u03a0 = blkdiag ( c1c > 1 , . . . , cnc > n ) . Moreover, \u03a0 is an identity mapping for all vectors in its range.\nProperty 1. \u03a0 = C>C is a rank n projection matrix.\nProof. For each block \u03a0j in the diagonal of \u03a0, we have \u03a02j = \u03a0j\u03a0j = cjc > j cjc > j = cjc > j \u2016cj\u20162 = \u03a0j . The rank of \u03a0 is n because each diagonal block \u03a0j is of rank one.\nTherefore, if x is a vector in RN and xc = Cx is its coarsened counterpart, then x\u0303 = C>Cx = \u03a0x is a localitypreserving approximation of x w.r.t. graph G.\nA toy example. Consider the example graph shown in Figure 1a and suppose that we want to coarsen the n1 = 3\ngray vertices VF = {v1, v2, v3} of G into vertex v\u20321, as shown in Figure 1b. Matrices C and Lc take the form:\nC = 1/\u221a3 1/\u221a3 1/\u221a3 0 00 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1  = [c>1 0 0 I2 ]\nLc = CLC > =  2/3 \u22121/\u221a3 \u22121/\u221a3\u22121/\u221a3 1 0 \u22121/ \u221a 3 0 1  Above, the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix I2 preserves the neighborhood of all vertices not in VF . The coarsening frame is shown in Figure 1c."}, {"heading": "2.2. Restricted spectral similarity", "text": "The objective of coarsening is dual. First, we aim to attain computational acceleration by reducing the dimensionality of our problem. On the other hand, we must ensure that we do not loose too much valuable information, in the sense that the structure of the reduced and original problems should be as close as possible.\nSpectral similarity. One way to define how close a matrix B approximates the action of matrix A is to establish a spectral similarity relation of the form:\n(1\u2212 )x>Ax \u2264 x>Bx \u2264 (1 + )x>Ax, (4)\nfor all \u2200x \u2208 RN and with a positive constant. Stated in our context, (4) can be rewritten as:\n(1\u2212 )x>Lx \u2264 x>c Lcxc \u2264 (1 + )x>Lx (5)\nfor all x \u2208 RN and with xc = Cx. If the equation holds, we say that matrix Lc is an -spectral approximation of L. In graph theory, the objective of constructing sparse spectrally similar graphs is the main idea of spectral graph sparsifiers, a popular method for accelerating the solution of linear systems involving the Laplacian, initially proposed by Spielman and co-authors (Spielman & Srivastava, 2011; Spielman & Teng, 2011).\nIn contrast to the sparsification literature however, here the dimension of the space changes and one needs to take into account both the Laplacian coarsening (L becomes Lc) and the vector downsampling operation (x becomes xc) in the\nsimilarity relation 1. Yet, from an analysis standpoint, an alternative interpretation is possible. Defining L\u0303 = \u03a0L\u03a0, we re-write\nx>c Lcxc = x >(C>C)L(C>C)x = x>\u03a0L\u03a0x = x>L\u0303x.\nRemembering that C> acts as an approximate inverse of C, we interpret L\u0303 \u2208 RN\u00d7N as an approximation of L that contains the same information as Lc \u2208 Rn\u00d7n.\nRestricted spectral similarity (RSS). Equation (5) thus states that the rank n\u2212 1 matrix L\u0303 is an -spectral approximation of L, a matrix of rank N \u2212 1. Since the two matrices have different rank, the relation cannot hold for every x \u2208 RN . To carry out a meaningful analysis, we focus on an appropriate subset of vectors.\nMore specifically, we restrict our attention to the first K eigenvectors of L and introduce the following property:\nDefinition 2 (Restricted spectral similarity). Suppose that there exists an integer K and positive constants k, such that for every k \u2264 K,\n(1\u2212 k)\u03bbk \u2264 u>k L\u0303uk \u2264 (1 + k)\u03bbk. (6)\nThen Lc is said to satisfy the restricted spectral similarity (RSS) property with RSS constants { k}Kk=1.\nThe relation to spectral similarity is exposed by substituting u>k Luk = \u03bbk.\nFor every k, inequality (6) should intuitively capture how close is Cuk to being an eigenvector of Lc: When k = 0, vector Cuk is an eigenvector of Lc with eigenvalue \u03bbk. On the hand, for k > 0, Cuk is not an eigenvector of Lc, but matrices L and L\u0303 alter the length of vectors in the span of uk in a similar manner (up to 1\u00b1 k). This intuition turns out to be valid. In the following we will demonstrate that the RSS property is a key ingredient in characterizing the relation between the first K eigenvalues and principal eigenspaces of the coarsened and actual Laplacian matrices. In particular, we will prove that the spectrum of Lc approximates that of L (up to lifting) when the constants k are sufficiently small. This line of thinking will be developed in Section 4.\nRemark 1. A uniform RSS constant = maxk\u2264K k is sufficient to guarantee spectrum preservation, however, individual constants { k}Kk=1 lead to tighter bounds."}, {"heading": "3. A randomized edge contraction algorithm", "text": "This section proposes an algorithm for coarsening a graph that provably produces coarsenings with bounded RSS con-\n1Coarsening could perhaps be interpreted as combining edge and vertex sparsification (Moitra, 2011).\nAlgorithm 1 Randomized Edge Contraction (REC) 1: input: G = (V, E), T, \u03c6 2: output: Gc = (Vc, Ec) 3: C \u2190 E , Gc \u2190 G 4: \u03a6\u2190\u2211eij\u2208E \u03c6ij , t\u2190 0. 5: while |C| > 0 and t < T do 6: t\u2190 t+ 1. 7: Select each eij from C with prob. pij = \u03c6ij/\u03a6 or\ncontinue with prob. 1\u2212\u2211eij\u2208C pij . 8: C \u2190 C \\ Nij 9: Gc \u2190 contract(Gc, eij) as in (2)\n10: end while\nstants k.\nThe method, which we refer to as REC, is described in Algorithm 1. REC resembles the common greedy procedure of generating maximal matchings, in that it maintains a candidate set C containing all edges that can be added to the matching. At each iteration, a new edge eij is added and set C is updated by removing from it all edges in the edge neighborhood set Nij defined as follows:\nNij = {epq | epq \u2208 E and p = i or q = j},\nwhich also includes the edge eij .\nYet, REC features two main differences. First, instead of selecting each new edge added to the matching uniformly at random, it utilizes a potential function \u03c6 defined on the edge set, i.e., \u03c6 : E \u2192 R+ with which it controls the probability pij that every edge is contracted. The second difference is that, at each iteration, REC does not select a valid edge with probability 1 \u2212\u2211eij\u2208C pij . This choice is not driven by computational concerns, but facilitates the analysis, as it alleviates the need for updating the total potential \u03a6 after every iteration.\nRemark 2. REC is equivalent to the O(M) complexity algorithm that samples from C directly in line 7 by updating \u03a6 at every iteration such that its value is \u2211 eij\u2208C \u03c6ij . Though we suggest to use this latter algorithm in practice, it is easier to express our results using the number of iterations T of Algorithm 1.\nREC returns a maximal matching when T is sufficiently large. As we will see in the following, it is sufficient to consider T = O(N). The exact number of iterations will be chosen in order to balance the trade-off between the expected dimensionality reduction ratio\nr \u2206 = E [ N \u2212 n N ] and the size of the RSS constants.\n3.1. Analysis of REC\nThe following theorem characterizes an individual RSS constant of an Lc generated by REC. As exemplified in Corollary 5.1, similar argumenrs can also be used to derive a uniform bound over all k for k \u2264 K. Theorem 3.1. Let Lc be the coarsened Laplacian produced by REC and further suppose that\n\u03bbk \u2264 0.5 min eij\u2208E\n{ di + dj\n2 + wij\n} .\nFor any k \u2265 0, the relation \u03bbk \u2264 u>k L\u0303uk \u2264 \u03bbk(1 + k) holds with probability at least\n1\u2212 c2 1\u2212 e\u2212c1T/N\n4 k max eij\u2208E \u03c7ij  \u2211 epq\u2208Nij wpq wij + 3\u2212 4\u03bbk wij  where c1 = N maxeij\u2208E\n\u2211 epq\u2208Nij ppq ,\nc2 = c1/N 1\u2212 e\u2212c1/N and \u03c7ij = \u03c6ij\u2211\nepq\u2208Nij \u03c6pq\n.\nThe theorem reveals that the dependency of k to some extremal properties implied by the potential function \u03c6 and the graph structure. It is noteworthy that\nc1 = O(1) implies lim N\u2192\u221e c2 = 1. (7)\nThese asymptotics can be taken at face value even for finite size problems: coarsening typically becomes computationally relevant for large N (typically N > 103), for which c2 has effectively converged to its limit.\nThe assumption that c1 is independent ofN can be satisfied either by assuming that G is a bounded degree graph, such that |Nij | N for every eij \u2208 E , or by choosing potential functions \u03c6ij that are inversely proportional to |Nij |. We can also incorporate the expected reduction ratio r in the bound, by noting that\nrN = \u2211 eij\u2208E P (eij \u2208 EF ) \u2265 \u2211 eij\u2208E pij 1\u2212 e\u2212TPij Pij\n\u2265 1\u2212 e \u2212TPmax\nPmax = 1\u2212 e\u2212c1T/N c1/N , (8)\n(see proof of Theorem 3.1 for definitions of Pij and Pmax) implying\n1\u2212 e\u2212c1T/N \u2264 rc1, (9)\nas well as that T = Nc1 log ( 1 1\u2212rc1 ) iterations suffice to achieve any r < 1/c1. Nevertheless, this latter estimate is more pessimistic than the one presented in Theorem 3.1.\nThe norm \u2016\u03a0\u22a5uk\u201622.

Thus, \u2016\u03a0\u22a5uk\u201622 depends on the ratio r (through (9)) and is smaller for small k (due to \u03bbk). This is reasonable: by definition, eigenvectors corresponding to small eigenvalues are smooth functions on G; averaging some of their entries locally on the graph is unlikely to alter their values significantly."}, {"heading": "3.2. The heavy-edge potential function", "text": "Let us examine how the achieved results behave for a specific potential function. Setting \u03c6ij = wij is a simple way to give preference to heavy frames\u2014indeed, heavy-edge matchings have been utilized as a heuristic for coarsening (e.g., in combination with graph partitioning (Karypis & Kumar, 1998b)).

It is straightforward to calculate that in this case\nc1 = 2\n( di + dj \u2212 wij\ndavg\n) = 4%max.\nTherefore, c1 = O(1) for all graphs in which \u2126(1) = %min \u2264 %max = O(1), and given sufficiently large N and some manipulation the probability estimate of Theorem 3.1 reduces to\n1\u2212 1\u2212 e \u22124%maxT/N\n4 k\n( 1 +\n1.5\u2212 2\u03bbk davg %min\n) .

Such graphs are especially common in machine learning, where often the connecticity of each vertex is explicitly constructed such that all degrees are close to some target value (e.g., using a k-nearest neighbor graph construction (Muja & Lowe, 2014)).\nAs a proof of concept, Figure 2 compares the actual constants k with the bound of Theorem 3.1 when utilizing REC with a heavy-edge potential to coarsen the following benchmark graphs: (i) a point cloud representing a bunny obtained by re-sampling the Stanford bunny 3Dmesh (Turk & Levoy, 1994) and applying a k-nn construction (N = 1000, r = 0.4, k = 30), (ii) a k-nn similarity graph capturing the geometry of a 2D manifold usually referred to as Swiss roll (N = 1000, r = 0.4, k = 10), (iii) A network describing the interaction of yeast proteins (Rossi & Ahmed, 2015) (N = 1458, r = 0.25, davg = 2, dmax = 56), and (iv) a d-regular graph (N = 400, r = 0.4, d = 20). To derive the bounds, we started from Theorem 3.1 and identified for each k the smallest k such that the success probability is at least ps = {0.5, 0.7}.

For any feasible expected dimensionality reduction ratio r, sufficiently large N and any > 0\n\u03bb\u03032 \u2264 1 + r\n1\u2212 \u03bb2 r \u03bb2,\nwith probability at least 1 \u2212 c34 ( 1 + 1.5wmax+2(1\u2212\u03bb2)davg %min ) where c3 = r (1 \u2212 e\u22124%maxT/N ). For a d-regular graph this probability is at least 1\u2212 1 (1 + 3\u2212\u03bb2d ).\nThe statement can be proved by taking a union bound with respect to the events {\u2016\u03a0\u22a5u2\u201622 > \u03bb2 r } and {u>2 L\u0303u2 > (1 + r )\u03bb2}, whose probabilities can be easily obtained from the results of Section 3.\nEigenspaces. We also analyze the angle between principal eigenspaces of L and Lc. We follow Li (1994) and split the (lifted) eigendecompositions of L and Lc as\nL = U\u039bU> = (Uk, Uk\u22a5)\n( \u039bk\n\u039bk\u22a5 )( U>k U>k\u22a5 ) C>LcC = (C >U\u0303)\u039b\u0303(U\u0303>C)\n= (C>U\u0303k, C >U\u0303k\u22a5)\n( \u039b\u0303k\n\u039b\u0303k\u22a5\n)( U\u0303>k C\nU\u0303>k\u22a5C\n) ,\nwhere \u039bk = diag(\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbk) and U1 = (u1, . . . , uk) (analogously for \u039b\u0303k and U\u0303k). The canonical angles (Davis & Kahan, 1970; Stewart, 1990) between the eigenspaces\nspanned by Uk and C>U\u0303k are the singlular values of the matrix\n\u0398(Uk, C >U\u0303k) \u2206 = arccos(U>k C >U\u0303kU\u0303 > k CUk) \u22121/2 (15)\nand moreover, the smaller the sinus of the canonical angles are, the closer the two subspaces lie.\nThe following theorem characterizes \u03d1k = \u2016 sin \u0398 ( Uk, C >U\u0303k ) \u20162F , a measure of the miss-alignment of the eigenspaces spanned by Uk and C>U\u0303k.\nTheorem 4.3. If Lc satisfies the RSS property, then\n\u03d1k \u2264 min  \u2211 2\u2264i\u2264k i\u03bbi + \u03bbk\u2016\u03a0\u22a5ui\u201622 \u03bb\u0303k+1 \u2212 \u03bbk ,\n\u2211 2\u2264i\u2264k (1 + i)\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bb2\u2016\u03a0ui\u201622 \u03bb\u0303k+1 \u2212 \u03bb2  , for every k \u2264 K.\nBoth bounds have something to offer: The first is applicable to situations where there is a significant eigenvalue separation between the subspace of interest and neighboring spaces (this condition also appears in classic perturbation analysis (Davis & Kahan, 1970)) and has the benefit of vanishing when n = N . The second bound on the other hand does not depend on the minimum eigengap between \u03bbk and \u03bbk+1, but on the gap between every eigenvalue \u03bbi in the subspace of interest and \u03bbk+1, which can be significantly smaller.\nWe obtain an end-to-end analysis of coarsening by combining Theorem 4.3 with Theorem 3.1 and taking a union bound over all k \u2264 K. However, the reader is urged to consider the proof of Corollary 5.1 for a more careful analysis with significantly improved probability estimates.\nThe importance of the eigenvalue distribution can be seen in Figure 3, where we examine the alignment of Uk and C>U\u0303k for different k when r = 0.4. The figure summarizes the results for 10 stochastic block model graphs, each consisting of N = 1000 vertices. These graphs were built\nby uniformly assigning vertices into K = 10 communities and connecting any two vertices with probability p or q depending on whether they belong in the same or different communities, respectively. Such constructions are well known to produce eigenvalue distributions that feature a large gap between theK andK+1 eigenvalues and small gaps everywhere else.\nBelow K the eigenspaces are poorly aligned and not much better than chance (dotted line). As soon as the size of the subspace becomes equal to K however we observe a significant drop, signifying good alignment. This matches the prediction offered by our bounds (dashed line). The phenomenon is replicated for two parametrizations of the stochastic block model, one featuring a low q (and thus a large gap) and one with larger q. Due to the smaller gap, in the latter case the trend is slightly less exaggerated."}, {"heading": "5. Implications for spectral clustering", "text": "Spectral clustering is a non-linear method for partitioning N points z1, z2, . . . , zN \u2208 RD into K sets S = {S1, S2, . . . , SK}. There exist many versions of the algorithm. We consider the \u201cunnormalized spectral clustering\u201d (Von Luxburg, 2007):\n1. Construct a similarity graph with wij = e\u2212\u2016zi\u2212zj\u2016 2 2/\u03c3 2\nbetween vertices vi and vj . Let L be the combinatorial Laplacian of the graph and write \u03a8 = UK \u2208 RN\u00d7K to denote the matrix of its first K eigenvectors. 2. Among all cluster assignments S, search for the assignment S\u2217 that minimizes the k-means cost:\nFK(\u03a8, S) = K\u2211 k=1 \u2211 vi,vj\u2208Sk \u2016\u03a8(i, :)\u2212\u03a8(j, :)\u201622 2 |Sk|\nThough a naive implementation of the above algorithm scales with O(N3), the acceleration of spectral clustering has been an active topic of research. A wide-range of sketching techniques have been proposed(Boutsidis et al., 2015a; Tremblay et al., 2016), arguably one of the fastest known algorithms utilizes coarsening. Roughly, the algorithm involves: (i) hierarchically coarsening the input graph (using edge contractions) until the latter reaches a target size; (ii) solving the clustering problem in the small dimension; (iii) lifting the solution back to the original domain; and (iv) performing some fast refinement to attain the final clustering.\nIn the following, we provide theoretical guarantees on the solution quality of the aforementioned scheme for a single coarsening level. To the extend of our knowledge, this is the first time that such an analysis has been carried out.\nTo perform the analysis, we suppose that\nS\u2217 = arg min S\u2208S FK(\u03a8, S) and S\u0303\u2217 = arg min S\u2208S FK(\u03a8\u0303, S)\nare the (optimal) clustering assignments obtained by solving the k-means using as input the original eigenvectors UK and the lifted eigenvectors \u03a8\u0303 = C>U\u0303K of Lc, respectively. We then measure the quality of S\u0303\u2217 by examining how far the correct minimizer FK(\u03a8, S\u2217) is to FK(\u03a8, S\u0303\u2217). Note that the latter quantity utilizes the correct eigenvectors as points and necessarily FK(\u03a8, S\u2217) \u2264 FK(\u03a8, S\u0303\u2217). Boutsidis et al. (2015a) noted that, if the two quantities are close then, despite the assignments themselves possibly being different, they both feature the same quality with respect to the k-means objective.\nWe prove the following approximation result:\nCorollary 5.1. Consider a bounded degree graph with \u03bbK \u2264 0.5 mineij\u2208E\n{ di+dj\n2 + wij\n} and suppose that it is\ncoarsened by REC using a heavy-edge potential. For sufficiently large N , any feasible ratio r, and > 0,\n[ FK(\u03a8, S\u0303\u2217)1/2 \u2212FK(\u03a8, S\u2217)1/2 ]2 \u2264 K\u2211 k=2 8 r\u03bbk \u03b4K\nwith probability at least 1\u2212 %max (\n1 + 6+4\u03bbK\u22128 c3davg%min\n) , where\n\u03b4K = \u03bbK+1 \u2212 \u03bbK and c3 = \u2211K k=2 \u03bb 2 k/ \u2211K k=2 \u03bbk.\nThe corollary therefore provides conditions such that the clustering assignment produced with the aid of coarsening has quality that is close to that of the original in terms of absolute error, even without refinement. Practically, our result states that S\u0303\u2217 is a good candidate for the final solution as long as the graph has almost constant degree (such that %min \u2248 1 \u2248 %max) and it is K clusterable (i.e., the gap \u03b4K = \u03bbK+1 \u2212 \u03bbK is large). We are unaware of any technique that provides meaningful lower bounds on FK(\u03a8, S\u2217) and therefore cannot transform the bound to a relative error statement. However, from the algebraic formulation of the k-means cost it follows that, when the number of clusters is \u03ba < K whereas the\nfeature matrix remains \u03a8, then F\u03ba(\u03a8, S\u2217) \u2265 K\u2212\u03ba (this is because \u03a8 has exactly K unit singular values, whereas the k-means clustering cannot do better than a rank \u03ba approximation of \u03a8 (Ding & He, 2004; Boutsidis et al., 2015b)). Under the conditions of Corollary 5.1 and with the same probability:FK(\u03a8, S\u0303\u2217) 12 \u2212FK(\u03a8, S\u2217) 12\nF\u03ba(\u03a8, S\u2217) 1/2\n2\u2264 K\u2211 k=2 8 r\u03bbk \u03b4K (K \u2212 \u03ba) ,\nwhich is a relaxed relative error guarantee.\nFigure 4 depicts the growth of the actual relative error with r. The particular experiment corresponds to a clustering problem involving N = 1000 images, each depicting a selected digit between 0 and 4 from the MNIST database (i.e., K = 5). We constructed a 12-nearest neighbor similarity graph and repeated the experiment 10 times, each time using a different image set, selected uniformly at random. This setting produces a simple, but non-trivial, clustering problem featuring some overlaps between clusters (see Figure 5 in the supplementary material).\nWe observed that most remaining error occurred at coarsened vertices lying at cluster boundaries. This can be eliminated by only a few iterations of local smoothing. Though more advanced techniques might be preferable from a computational perspective, such as Chebychev or ARMA graph filters (Shuman et al., 2011; Isufi et al., 2017), for illustration purposes, we here additionally perform t = {2, 10} steps of a simple power iteration scheme, yielding an O(tM(K \u2212 1)) overhead. The experiment confirms that most errors are removed after few iterations."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion", "text": "The main message of our work is the following: coarsening locally perturbs individual eigenvectors; however, if carefully constructed, it can leave well-separated principal eigenspaces relatively untouched.\nThe main limitation of our analysis is that the concentration estimates given by Theorem 3.1 are conservative. We are currently considering methods to improve our bounds by taking into account the dependency structure of the binomial random variables in the sum. In addition, we are investigating how to generalize our analysis to the multi-level setting, where n can be as small as O(logN). Finally, we are considering the implications of our results to supervised methods for learning from graph-structured data in general, and graph convolutional neural networks in particular."}], "year": 2018, "references": [{"title": "Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation", "authors": ["M.
