162	1	The γ error of Algorithm 1 is E(τ̂α, γ,M∆V,α(N0,N1)) ≤ 1 2 exp ( ϵN 2 ( 1− √ 1 + 4γM1M0 τ̂αN2 ) · √ τ̂αN1N0 (N21 +N 2 0 )N + 2τ̂αN1N0 ) .
167	1	The objective is investigation of the independence between X0 and Xk for k = 1, .
168	1	,K. We denote the null hypothesis that X0 and Xk are independent by Hk0 .
171	1	We can verify the independence of each random variable pair by evaluating Eq.
172	1	In multiple hypothesis testing, we consider to control the familywise error rate (FWER), the probability that the null hypothesis is rejected mistakenly at least once among K tests.
176	1	However, the privacy guarantee weakens as the number of hypothesis K increases by Theorem 1.
182	1	In this section, we provide two differentially private multiple hypothesis testing methods that can conserve the privacy budget even with large K and controls FWER properly.
184	1	The SVT based procedure works in the interactive setting (Lyu et al., 2017), in which the hypothesis to be considered at each round can be interactively chosen after observing the result of the tests in the previous rounds (Webb & Petitjean, 2016).
185	1	We first show the SVT-based procedure with the unit circle mechanism (UCM+SVT).
192	1	Recall that SVT adds noise to the threshold to compare in Eq.
195	1	Also, we use Bonferoni correction to control the FWER.
199	1	In our setting, we need to apply Bonferroni correction to control the FWER.
202	1	In the experimental results of single hypothesis test in Section 7, input perturbation+MC also achieves good performance.
206	1	However, this method outputs s1 pairs even if all pairs are not significant.
211	1	The settings and the algorithm is detailed in Appendix J.
212	1	In this section, we evaluate the significance and the power of the respective mechanisms, input perturbation (Gaboardi et al., 2016), output perturbation (Yu et al., 2014), and unit circle mechanism for single hypothesis testing.
216	1	The significance of the unit circle mechanism and output perturbation is controlled by adjusting τα by Monte Carlo sampling.
222	1	We set the privacy parameter as ϵ = 0.1 and significance level as α = 0.05.
225	1	The significance of output perturbation unchanged even when the sample size increases.
227	1	The controlled significance version of these mechanisms can properly control the significance at 0.95 for any sample size (Figure 2(d)-2(f)).
230	1	To evaluate the power, we assess the rate at which the mechanism outputs rej correctly when H1 is true.
231	1	We set the privacy parameter ϵ = 0.1 and significance level α = 0.05.
232	1	Figure 3 shows that the unit circle mechanism with Monte Carlo sampling (UCM+MC) has similar power to that of the input perturbation with Monte Carlo sampling (IP+MC).
234	1	The γ-error of UCM+MC can be analyzed as discussed in Section 3.4.
240	1	In this subsection, we experimentally evaluate FWER and utility of UCM+SVT and UCM+EM.
