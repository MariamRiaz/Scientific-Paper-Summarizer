"When analyzing data from these real-world networks, traditional methods often represent vertices (nodes) as one-hot representations (containing the connectivity information of each vertex with respect to all other vertices), usually suffering from issues related to the inherent sparsity of large-scale networks.",1 Introduction,0,[0]
"This results in models that are not able to fully capture the relationships between vertices of the network (Perozzi et al., 2014; Tu et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,0,[0]

"This approach has attracted considerable attention in recent years (Tang and Liu, 2009; Perozzi et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015; Grover and Leskovec, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2018).

"DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), which learns vertex representations from random-walk sequences, similarly, only takes into account structural information of the network.",1 Introduction,0,[0]

"However, as shown in Figure 1, to assess the similarity between two research papers, a more effective strategy would compare and align (via localweighting) individual important words (keywords) within a pair of abstracts, while information from other words (e.g., stop words) that tend to be less relevant can be effectively ignored (downweighted).",1 Introduction,1,"['However, as shown in Figure 1, to assess the similarity between two research papers, a more effective strategy would compare and align (via localweighting) individual important words (keywords) within a pair of abstracts, while information from other words (e.g., stop words) that tend to be less relevant can be effectively ignored (downweighted).']"
"This alignment mechanism is difficult to accomplish in models where text sequences are first embedded into a common space and then compared in pairs (He and Lin, 2016; Parikh et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2017; Wang et al., 2017b; Shen et al., 2018a).

We propose to learn a semantic-aware Network Embedding (NE) that incorporates wordlevel alignment features abstracted from text sequences associated with vertex pairs.,1 Introduction,0,[0]

"These features are then accumulated via a simple but efficient aggregation function, obtaining the final representation for the sentence.",1 Introduction,0,[0]
"As a result, the word-by-word alignment features (as illustrated in Figure 1) are explicitly and effectively captured by our model.",1 Introduction,0,[0]
"Further, the learned network embeddings under our framework are adaptive to the specific (local) vertices that are considered, and thus are context-aware and especially suitable for downstream tasks, such as link prediction.",1 Introduction,0,[0]
"Moreover, since the word-by-word matching procedure introduced here is highly parallelizable and does not require any complex encoding networks, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our framework requires significantly less time for training, which is attractive for large-scale network applications.
