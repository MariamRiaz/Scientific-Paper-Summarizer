{"sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Neural machine translation (NMT) (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) has made significant progress in the past several years. Its goal is to construct and utilize a single large neural network to accomplish the entire translation task. One great advantage of NMT is that the translation system can be completely constructed by learning from data without human involvement (cf., feature engineering in statistical machine translation (SMT)). The encoderdecoder architecture is widely employed (Cho et al.,\n2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), in which the encoder summarizes the source sentence into a vector representation, and the decoder generates the target sentence word-by-word from the vector representation. The representation of the source sentence and the representation of the partially generated target sentence (translation) at each position are referred to as source context and target context, respectively. The generation of a target word is determined jointly by the source context and target context.\nSeveral techniques in NMT have proven to be very effective, including gating (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014) and attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) which can model long-distance dependencies and complicated align-\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n06 04\n3v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nM ar\nment relations in the translation process. Using an encoder-decoder framework that incorporates gating and attention techniques, it has been reported that the performance of NMT can surpass the performance of traditional SMT as measured by BLEU score (Luong et al., 2015).\nDespite this success, we observe that NMT usually yields fluent but inadequate translations.1 We attribute this to a stronger influence of target context on generation, which results from a stronger language model than that used in SMT. One question naturally arises: what will happen if we change the ratio of influences from the source or target contexts?\nTable 1 shows an example in which an attentionbased NMT system (Bahdanau et al., 2015) generates a fluent yet inadequate translation (e.g., missing the translation of \u201cgua\u030cngdo\u0304ng\u201d). When we halve the contribution from the source context, the result further loses its adequacy by missing the partial translation \u201cin the first two months of this year\u201d. One possible explanation is that the target context takes a higher weight and thus the system favors a shorter translation. In contrast, when we halve the contribution from the target context, the result completely loses its fluency by repeatedly generating the translation of \u201cchu\u0304ko\u030cu\u201d (i.e., \u201cthe export of\u201d) until the generated translation reaches the maximum length. Therefore, this example indicates that source and target contexts in NMT are highly correlated to translation adequacy and fluency, respectively.\nIn fact, conventional NMT lacks effective control on the influence of source and target contexts. At each decoding step, NMT treats the source and target contexts equally, and thus ignores the different needs of the contexts. For example, content words in the target sentence are more related to the translation adequacy, and thus should depend more on the source context. In contrast, function words in the target sentence are often more related to the translation fluency (e.g., \u201cof\u201d after \u201cis fond\u201d), and thus should depend more on the target context.\nIn this work, we propose to use context gates to control the contributions of source and target contexts on the generation of target words (decoding)\n1Fluency measures whether the translation is fluent, while adequacy measures whether the translation is faithful to the original sentence (Snover et al., 2009).\nin NMT. Context gates are non-linear gating units which can dynamically select the amount of context information in the decoding process. Specifically, at each decoding step, the context gate examines both the source and target contexts, and outputs a ratio between zero and one to determine the percentages of information to utilize from the two contexts. In this way, the system can balance the adequacy and fluency of the translation with regard to the generation of a word at each position.\nExperimental results show that introducing context gates leads to an average improvement of +2.3 BLEU points over a standard attention-based NMT system (Bahdanau et al., 2015). An interesting finding is that we can replace the GRU units in the decoder with conventional RNN units and in the meantime utilize context gates. The translation performance is comparable with the standard NMT system with GRU, but the system enjoys a simpler structure (i.e., uses only a single gate and half of the parameters) and a faster decoding (i.e., requires only half the matrix computations for decoding).2"}, {"heading": "2 Neural Machine Translation", "text": "Suppose that x = x1, . . . xj , . . . xJ represents a source sentence and y = y1, . . . yi, . . . yI a target sentence.

Specifically, the source representation si stands for source context, which embeds the information from the source sentence. The\nprevious decoding state ti\u22121 and the previously generated word yi\u22121 constitute the target context.3"}, {"heading": "2.1 Effects of Source and Target Contexts", "text": "We first empirically investigate our hypothesis: whether source and target contexts correlate to translation adequacy and fluency. Figure 2(a) shows the translation lengths with various scaling ratios (a, b)\n3In a recent implementation of NMT (https: //github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial), ti\u22121 and yi\u22121 are combined together with a GRU before being fed into the decoder, which can boost translation performance. We follow the practice and treat both of them as target context.\nfor source and target contexts:\nti = f(b\u2297 (We(yi\u22121) + Uti\u22121) + a\u2297 Csi)\nFor example, the pair (1.0, 0.5) means fully leveraging the effect of source context while halving the effect of target context. Reducing the effect of target context (i.e., the lines (1.0, 0.8) and (1.0, 0.5)) results in longer translations, while reducing the effect of source context (i.e., the lines (0.8, 1.0) and (0.5, 1.0)) leads to shorter translations. When halving the effect of the target context, most of the generated translations reach the maximum length, which is three times the length of source sentence in this work.\nFigure 2(b) shows the results of manual evaluation on 200 source sentences randomly sampled from the test sets. Reducing the effect of source context (i.e., (0.8, 1.0) and (0.5, 1.0)) leads to more fluent yet less adequate translations. On the other hand, reducing the effect of target context (i.e., (1.0, 0.5) and (1.0, 0.8)) is expected to yield more adequate but less fluent translations. In this setting, the source words are translated (i.e., higher adequacy) while the translations are in wrong order (i.e., lower fluency). In practice, however, we observe the side effect that some source words are translated repeatedly until the translation reaches the maximum length (i.e., lower fluency), while others are left untranslated (i.e., lower adequacy). The reason is two fold:\n1. NMT lacks a mechanism that guarantees that each source word is translated.4 The decoding state implicitly models the notion of \u201ccoverage\u201d by recurrently reading the time-dependent source context si. Lowering its contribution weakens the \u201ccoverage\u201d effect and encourages the decoder to regenerate phrases multiple times to achieve the desired translation length.\n2. The translation is incomplete. As shown in Table 1, NMT can get stuck in an infinite loop repeatedly generating a phrase due to the overwhelming influence of the source context. As a result, generation terminates early because\n4The recently proposed coverage based technique can alleviate this problem (Tu et al., 2016). In this work, we consider another approach, which is complementary to the coverage mechanism.\nthe translation reaches the maximum length allowed by the implementation, even though the decoding procedure is not finished.\nThe quantitative (Figure 2) and qualitative (Table 1) results confirm our hypothesis, i.e., source and target contexts are highly correlated to translation adequacy and fluency. We believe that a mechanism that can dynamically select information from source context and target context would be useful for NMT models, and this is exactly the approach we propose."}, {"heading": "3 Context Gates", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Architecture", "text": "Inspired by the success of gated units in RNN (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014), we propose using context gates to dynamically control the amount of information flowing from the source and target contexts and thus balance the fluency and adequacy of NMT at each decoding step.\nIntuitively, at each decoding step i, the context gate looks at input signals from both the source (i.e., si) and target (i.e., ti\u22121 and yi\u22121) sides, and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each element in the input vectors, where 1 denotes \u201ccompletely transferring this\u201d while 0 denotes \u201ccompletely ignoring this\u201d. The corresponding input signals are then processed with an element-wise multiplication before being fed to the activation layer to update the decoding state.\nFormally, a context gate consists of a sigmoid neural network layer and an element-wise multiplication operation, as illustrated in Figure 3. The context gate assigns an element-wise weight to the input\nsignals, computed by\nzi = \u03c3(Wze(yi\u22121) + Uzti\u22121 + Czsi) (4)\nHere \u03c3(\u00b7) is a logistic sigmoid function, and Wz \u2208 Rn\u00d7m, Uz \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, Cz \u2208 Rn\u00d7n \u2032 are the weight matrices. Again, m, n and n\u2032 are the dimensions of word embedding, decoding state, and source representation, respectively. Note that zi has the same dimensionality as the transferred input signals (e.g., Csi), and thus each element in the input vectors has its own weight."}, {"heading": "3.2 Integrating Context Gates into NMT", "text": "Next, we consider how to integrate context gates into an NMT model.\nThe context gate can decide the amount of context information used in generating the next target word at each step of decoding. For example, after obtaining the partial translation \u201c. . . new high level technology product\u201d, the gate looks at the translation contexts and decides to depend more heavily on the source context. Accordingly, the gate assigns higher weights to the source context and lower weights to the target context and then feeds them into the decoding activation layer. This could correct inadequate translations, such as the missing translation of \u201cgua\u030cngdo\u0304ng\u201d, due to greater influence from the target context.\nWe have three strategies for integrating context gates into NMT that either affect one of the translation contexts or both contexts, as illustrated in Figure 4. The first two strategies are inspired by output gates in LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,\n1997), which control the amount of memory content utilized. In these kinds of models, zi only affects either source context (i.e., si) or target context (i.e., yi\u22121 and ti\u22121):\n\u2022 Context Gate (source)\nti = f ( We(yi\u22121) + Uti\u22121 + zi \u25e6 Csi ) \u2022 Context Gate (target)\nti = f ( zi \u25e6 (We(yi\u22121) + Uti\u22121) + Csi ) where \u25e6 is an element-wise multiplication, and zi is the context gate calculated by Equation 4. This is also essentially similar to the reset gate in the GRU, which decides what information to forget from the previous decoding state before transferring that information to the decoding activation layer. The difference is that here the \u201creset\u201d gate resets the context vector rather than the previous decoding state.\nThe last strategy is inspired by the concept of update gate from GRU, which takes a linear sum between the previous state ti\u22121 and the candidate new state t\u0303i. In our case, we take a linear interpolation between source and target contexts:\n\u2022 Context Gate (both)\nti = f ( (1\u2212 zi) \u25e6 (We(yi\u22121) + Uti\u22121) + zi \u25e6 Csi )"}, {"heading": "4 Related Work", "text": "Comparison to (Xu et al., 2015): Context gates are inspired by the gating scalar model proposed by Xu et al. (2015) for the image caption generation task. The essential difference lies in the task requirement:\n\u2022 In image caption generation, the source side (i.e., image) contains more information than the target side (i.e., caption). Therefore, they employ a gating scalar to scale only the source context.\n\u2022 In machine translation, both languages should contain equivalent information. Our model jointly controls the contributions from the source and target contexts. A direct interaction between input signals from both sides is useful for balancing adequacy and fluency of NMT.\nOther differences in the architecture include:\n1 Xu et al. (2015) uses a scalar that is shared by all elements in the source context, while we employ a gate with a distinct weight for each element. The latter offers the gate a more precise control of the context vector, since different elements retain different information.\n2 We add peephole connections to the architecture, by which the source context controls the gate. It has been shown that peephole connections make precise timings easier to learn (Gers and Schmidhuber, 2000).\n3 Our context gate also considers the previously generated word yi\u22121 as input. The most recently generated word can help the gate to better estimate the importance of target context, especially for the generation of function words in translations that may not have a corresponding word in the source sentence (e.g., \u201cof\u201d after \u201cis fond\u201d).\nExperimental results (Section 5.4) show that these modifications consistently improve translation quality.\nComparison to Gated RNN: State-of-the-art NMT models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) generally employ a gated unit (e.g., GRU or LSTM) as the activation function in the decoder. One might suspect that the context gate proposed in this work is somewhat redundant, given the existing gates that control the amount of information carried over from the previous decoding state si\u22121 (e.g., reset gate in GRU). We argue that they are in fact complementary: the context gate regulates the contextual information flowing into the decoding state, while the gated unit captures long-term dependencies between decoding states. Our experiments confirm the correctness of our hypothesis: the context gate not only improves translation quality when compared to a conventional RNN unit (e.g., an element-wise tanh), but also when compared to a gated unit of GRU, as shown in Section 5.2.\nComparison to Coverage Mechanism: Recently, Tu et al. (2016) propose adding a coverage mechanism into NMT to alleviate over-translation and under-translation problems, which directly affect translation adequacy. They maintain a coverage vector to keep track of which source words have been translated. The coverage vector is fed to the attention model to help adjust future attention. This guides NMT to focus on the un-translated source words while avoiding repetition of source content. Our approach is complementary: the coverage mechanism produces a better source context representation, while our context gate controls the effect of the source context based on its relative importance. Experiments in Section 5.2 show that combining the two methods can further improve translation performance. There is another difference\nas well: the coverage mechanism is only applicable to attention-based NMT models, while the context gate is applicable to all NMT models.\nComparison to Exploiting Auxiliary Contexts in Language Modeling: A thread of work in language modeling (LM) attempts to exploit auxiliary sentence-level or document-level context in an RNN LM (Mikolov and Zweig, 2012; Ji et al., 2015; Wang and Cho, 2016). Independent of our work, Wang and Cho (2016) propose \u201cearly fusion\u201d models of RNNs where additional information from an intersentence context is \u201cfused\u201d with the input to the RNN. Closely related to Wang and Cho (2016), our approach aims to dynamically control the contributions of required source and target contexts for machine translation, while theirs focuses on integrating auxiliary corpus-level contexts for language modelling to better approximate the corpus-level probability. In addition, we employ a gating mechanism to produce a dynamic weight at different decoding steps to combine source and target contexts, while they do a linear combination of intra-sentence and inter-sentence contexts with static weights. Experiments in Section 5.2 show that our gating mechanism significantly outperforms linear interpolation when combining contexts.\nComparison to Handling Null-Generated Words in SMT: In machine translation, there are certain syntactic elements of the target language that are missing in the source (i.e., null-generated words). In fact this was the preliminary motivation for our approach: current attention models lack a mechanism to control the generation of words that do not have a strong correspondence on the source side. The model structure of NMT is quite similar to the traditional word-based SMT (Brown et al., 1993). Therefore, techniques that have proven effective in SMT may also be applicable to NMT. Toutanova et al. (2002) extend the calculation of translation probabilities to include null-generated target words in word-based SMT. These words are generated based on both the special source token null and the neighbouring word in the target language by a mixture model. We have simplified and generalized their approach: we use context gates to dynamically control the contribution of source context. When producing null-generated words, the context gate can as-\nsign lower weights to the source context, by which the source-side information have less influence. In a sense, the context gate relieves the need for a null state in attention."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1 Setup", "text": "We carried out experiments on Chinese-English translation. The training dataset consisted of 1.25M sentence pairs extracted from LDC corpora5, with 27.9M Chinese words and 34.5M English words respectively. We chose the NIST 2002 (MT02) dataset as the development set, and the NIST 2005 (MT05), 2006 (MT06) and 2008 (MT08) datasets as the test sets. We used the case-insensitive 4-gram NIST BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) as the evaluation metric, and sign-test (Collins et al., 2005) for the statistical significance test.\nFor efficient training of the neural networks, we limited the source and target vocabularies to the most frequent 30K words in Chinese and English, covering approximately 97.7% and 99.3% of the data in the two languages respectively. All out-ofvocabulary words were mapped to a special token UNK. We trained each model on sentences of length up to 80 words in the training data.

We carried out experiments on multiple NMT variants. For example, \u201c2 + Context Gate (both)\u201d in Row 3 denotes integrating \u201cContext Gate (both)\u201d into the baseline in Row 2 (i.e., GroundHog (vanilla)). For baselines, we found that the gated unit (i.e., GRU , Row 4) indeed surpasses its vanilla counterpart (i.e., tanh, Row 2), which is consistent with the results in other work (Chung et al., 2014). Clearly the proposed context gates significantly improve the translation quality in all cases, although there are still considerable differences among the variants:\nParameters Context gates introduce a few new parameters.

The context gates only introduce 3.6M additional parameters, which is quite small compared to the number of parameters in the existing models (e.g., 84.3M in the \u201cGroundHog (GRU )\u201d).\nOver GroundHog (vanilla) We first carried out experiments on a simple decoder without gating function (Rows 2 and 3), to better estimate the impact of context gates. As shown in Table 2, the proposed context gate significantly improved translation performance by 4.2 BLEU points on average. It is worth emphasizing that context gate even outperforms a more sophisticated gating function (i.e., GRU in Row 4). This is very encouraging, since our model only has a single gate with half of the parameters (i.e., 3.6M versus 7.2M) and less computations (i.e., half the matrix computations to update the decoding state8).\n8We only need to calculate the context gate once via Equation 4 and then apply it when updating the decoding state. In contrast, GRU requires the calculation of an update gate, a reset gate, a proposed updated decoding state and an interpolation between the previous state and the proposed state. Please refer to (Cho et al., 2014) for more details.\nOver GroundHog (GRU) We then investigated the effect of the context gates on a standard NMT with GRU as the decoding activation function (Rows 4-7). Several observations can be made. First, context gates also boost performance beyond the GRU in all cases, demonstrating our claim that context gates are complementary to the reset and update gates in GRU. Second, jointly controlling the information from both translation contexts consistently outperforms its single-side counterparts, indicating that a direct interaction between input signals from the source and target contexts is useful for NMT models.\nOver GroundHog-Coverage (GRU) We finally tested on a stronger baseline, which employs a coverage mechanism to indicate whether or not a source word has already been translated (Tu et al., 2016). Our context gate still achieves a significant improvement of 1.6 BLEU points on average, reconfirming our claim that the context gate is complementary to the improved attention model that produces a better source context representation. Finally, our best model (Row 7) outperforms the SMT baseline system using the same data (Row 1) by 3.3 BLEU points.\nFrom here on, we refer to \u201cGroundHog\u201d for \u201cGroundHog (GRU )\u201d, and \u201cContext Gate\u201d for \u201cContext Gate (both)\u201d if not otherwise stated.\nSubjective Evaluation We also conducted a subjective evaluation of the benefit of incorporating context gates. Two human evaluators were asked to compare the translations of 200 source sentences randomly sampled from the test sets without knowing which system produced each translation. Table 3 shows the results of subjective evaluation. The two human evaluators made similar judgments: in adequacy, around 30% of GroundHog translations are worse, 52% are equal, and 18% are better; while in\nfluency, around 29% are worse, 52% are equal, and 19% are better."}, {"heading": "5.3 Alignment Quality", "text": "Table 4 lists the alignment performances.

When combined with coverage mechanism, however, it produces better alignments, especially one-to-one alignments by selecting the source word with the highest alignment probability per target word (i.e., AER score). One possible reason is that better estimated decoding states (from the context gate) and coverage information help to produce more concentrated alignments, as shown in Figure 6."}, {"heading": "5.4 Architecture Analysis", "text": "Table 5 shows a detailed analysis of architecture components measured in BLEU scores.

(2015) and group sentences of similar lengths together. Figure 7 shows\nthe BLEU score and the averaged length of translations for each group. GroundHog performs very well on short source sentences, but degrades on long source sentences (i.e., > 30), which may be due to the fact that source context is not fully interpreted. Context gates can alleviate this problem by balancing the source and target contexts, and thus improve decoder performance on long sentences. In fact, incorporating context gates boost translation performance on all source sentence groups.\nWe confirm that context gate weight zi correlates well with translation performance. In other words, translations that contain higher zi (i.e., source context contributes more than target context) at many time steps are better in translation performance. We used the mean of the sequence z1, . . . , zi, . . . , zI as the gate weight of each sentence. We calculated the Pearson Correlation between the sentence-level gate weight and the corresponding improvement on translation performance (i.e., BLEU, adequacy, and fluency scores),9 as shown in Table 6. We observed that context gate weight is positively correlated with translation performance improvement and that the correlation is higher on long sentences.\nAs an example, consider this source sentence from the test set:\n9We use the average of correlations on subjective evaluation metrics (i.e., adequacy and fluency) by two evaluators.\nzho\u0304uliu\u0300 zhe\u0300ngsh\u0131\u0300 y\u0131\u0304ngguo\u0301 m\u0131\u0301nzho\u0300ng da\u0300o cha\u0304osh\u0131\u0300 ca\u030cigo\u0300u de ga\u0304ofe\u0304ng sh\u0131\u0301ke\u0300, da\u0304ngsh\u0131\u0301 14 jia\u0304 cha\u0304osh\u0131\u0300 de gua\u0304nb\u0131\u0300 l\u0131\u0300ng y\u0131\u0304ngguo\u0301 zhe\u0300 jia\u0304 zu\u0131\u0300 da\u0300 de lia\u0301nsuo\u030c cha\u0304osh\u0131\u0300 su\u030cnsh\u0131\u0304 shu\u0300ba\u030ciwa\u0300n y\u0131\u0304ngba\u0300ng de xia\u0304osho\u0300u sho\u0304uru\u0300 .\nGroundHog translates it into:\ntwenty - six london supermarkets were closed at a peak hour of the british population in the same period of time .\nwhich almost misses all the information of the source sentence.

Based on this observation, we propose using context gates in NMT to dynamically control the contributions from the source and target contexts in the generation of a target sentence, to enhance the adequacy of NMT. By providing NMT the ability to choose the appropriate amount of information from the source and target contexts, one can alleviate many translation problems from which NMT suffers. Experimental results show that NMT with context gates achieves consistent and significant improvements in translation quality over different NMT models.\nContext gates are in principle applicable to all sequence-to-sequence learning tasks in which information from the source sequence is transformed to the target sequence (corresponding to adequacy) and the target sequence is generated (corresponding to fluency). In the future, we will investigate the effectiveness of context gates to other tasks, such as dialogue and summarization. It is also necessary to validate the effectiveness of our approach on more language pairs and other NMT architectures (e.g., using LSTM as well as GRU, or multiple layers)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This work is supported by China National 973 project 2014CB340301.

We find that source contexts have a direct impact on the adequacy of a translation while target contexts affect the fluency. Intuitively, generation of a content word should rely more on the source context and generation of a functional word should rely more on the target context. Due to the lack of effective control over the influence from source and target contexts, conventional NMT tends to yield fluent but inadequate translations. To address this problem, we propose context gates which dynamically control the ratios at which source and target contexts contribute to the generation of target words. In this way, we can enhance both the adequacy and fluency of NMT with more careful control of the information flow from contexts. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves upon a standard attentionbased NMT system by +2.3 BLEU points.", "title": "Context Gates for Neural Machine Translation"}
