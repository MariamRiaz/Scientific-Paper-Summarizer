In log-linear models, including both the original work on maximum-entropy models (Berger et al., 1996), and later work on conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001),\n\u21e4Part of this work done at Google. \u2020Work done at Google.\nthe scoring function s(x, y; \u2713) = \u2713 \u00b7 f(x, y) where f(x, y) 2 Rd is a feature vector, and \u2713 2 Rd are the parameters of the model. In more recent work on neural networks the function s(x, y; \u2713) is a nonlinear function. In Word2Vec the scoring function is s(x, y; \u2713) = \u2713\nx \u00b7 \u27130 y\nwhere y is a word in the context of word x, and \u2713\nx 2 Rd and \u27130 y 2 Rd are \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d word embeddings x and y.\nIn many NLP applications the set Y is large. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the parameters \u2713 requires calculation of Z(x; \u2713) or its derivatives at each training step, thereby requiring a summation over all members of Y , which can be computationally expensive. This has led to many authors considering alternative methods, often referred to as \u201cnegative sampling methods\u201d, where a modified training objective is used that does not require summation over Y on each example. Instead negative examples are drawn from some distribution, and a objective function is derived based on binary classification or ranking. Prominent examples are the binary objective used in word2vec ((Mikolov et al., 2013), see also (Levy and Goldberg, 2014)), and the Noise Contrastive Estimation methods of (Mnih and Teh, 2012; Jozefowicz et al., 2016) for estimation of language models.\nIn spite of the centrality of negative sampling methods, they are arguably not well understood from a theoretical standpoint. There are clear connections to noise contrastive estimation (NCE) (Gutmann and Hyva\u0308rinen, 2012), a negative sampling method for parameter estimation in joint models of the form\np(y) = exp (s(y; \u2713))\nZ(\u2713) ; Z(\u2713) =\nX y2Y exp (s(y; \u2713))\n(2) However there has not been a rigorous theoretical analysis of NCE in the estimation of conditional models of the form in Eq. 1, and we will argue there are subtle but important questions when generalizing NCE to the conditional case. In particular, the joint model in Eq 2 has a single partition function Z(\u2713) which is estimated as a param-\neter of the model (Gutmann and Hyva\u0308rinen, 2012) whereas the conditional model in Eq 1 has a separate partition function Z(x; \u2713) for each value of x. This difference is critical.\nWe show the following (throughout we define K 1 to be the number of negative examples sampled per training example): \u2022 For any K 1, a binary classification variant of NCE, as used by (Mnih and Teh, 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013), gives consistent parameter estimates under the assumption that Z(x; \u2713) is constant with respect to x (i.e., Z(x; \u2713) = H(\u2713) for some function H). Equivalently, the method is consistent under the assumption that the function s(x, y; \u2713) is powerful enough to incorporate logZ(x; \u2713). \u2022 For any K 1, a ranking-based variant of NCE, as used by (Jozefowicz et al., 2016), gives consistent parameter estimates under the much weaker assumption that Z(x; \u2713) can vary with x. Equivalently, there is no need for s(x, y; \u2713) to be powerful enough to incorporate logZ(x; \u2713). \u2022 We analyze the statistical efficiency of the ranking-based and classification-based NCE variants. Under respective assumptions, both variants achieve Fisher efficiency (the same asymptotic mean square error as the MLE) as K ! 1. \u2022 We discuss application of our results to approaches of (Mnih and Teh, 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013; Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Jozefowicz et al., 2016) giving a unified account of these methods. \u2022 We describe experiments on synthetic data and language modeling evaluating the effectiveness of the two NCE variants."}, {"heading": "2 Basic Assumptions", "text": "We assume the following setup throughout: \u2022 We have sets X and Y , where X ,Y are finite. \u2022 There is some unknown joint distribution\np X,Y (x, y) where x 2 X and y 2 Y . We assume that the marginal distributions satisfy p\nX (x) > 0 for all x 2 X and p\nY (y) > 0 for all y 2 Y . \u2022 We have training examples {x(i), y(i)}n\ni=1 drawn I.I.D. from p\nX,Y (x, y). \u2022 We have a scoring function s(x, y; \u2713) where \u2713 are the parameters of the model. For example, s(x, y; \u2713) may be defined by a neural network. \u2022 We use \u21e5 to refer to the parameter space. We assume that \u21e5 \u2713 Rd for some integer d. \u2022 We use p\nN (y) to refer to a distribution from which negative examples are drawn in the NCE approach. We assume that p\nN satisfies p N (y) > 0 for all y 2 Y .\nWe will consider estimation under the following two assumptions:\nAssumption 2.1 There exists some parameter value \u2713\u21e4 2 \u21e5 such that for all (x, y) 2 X \u21e5 Y ,\np Y |X(y|x) =\nexp(s(x, y; \u2713\u21e4))\nZ(x; \u2713\u21e4) (3)\nwhere Z(x; \u2713\u21e4) = P y2Y exp(s(x, y; \u2713 \u21e4 )).\nAssumption 2.2 There exists some parameter value \u2713\u21e4 2 \u21e5, and a constant \u21e4 2 R, such that for all (x, y) 2 X \u21e5 Y ,\np Y |X(y|x) = exp (s(x, y; \u2713\u21e4) \u21e4) . (4)\nAssumption 2.2 is stronger than Assumption 2.1. It requires logZ(x; \u2713\u21e4) \u2318 \u21e4 for all x 2 X , that is, the conditional distribution is perfectly self-normalized. Under Assumption 2.2, it must be the case that 8x 2 X X\ny\np Y |X(y|x) =\nX\ny\nexp{s(x, y; \u2713\u21e4) \u21e4} = 1\nThere are |X | constraints but only d + 1 free parameters. Therefore self-normalization is a nontrivial assumption when |X | d. In the case of language modeling, |X | = |V |k d + 1, where |V | is the vocabulary size and k is the length of the context. The number of constraints grows exponentially fast.\nGiven a scoring function s(x, y; \u2713) that satisfies assumption 2.1, we can derive a scoring function s0 that satisfies assumption 2.2 by defining\ns0(x, y; \u2713, {c x : x 2 X}) = s(x, y; \u2713) c x\nwhere c x 2 R is a parameter for history x. Thus we introduce a new parameter c\nx for each possible history x. This is the most straightforward extension of NCE to the conditional case; it is used by (Mnih and Teh, 2012). It has the clear drawback however of introducing a large number of additional parameters to the model."}, {"heading": "3 Two Estimation Algorithms", "text": "Figure 1 shows two NCE-based parameter estimation algorithms, based respectively on binary objective and ranking objective. The input to either algorithm is a set of training examples {x(i), y(i)}n\ni=1, a parameter K specifying the number of negative examples per training example, and\na distribution p N (\u00b7) from which negative examples are sampled. The algorithms differ only in the choice of objective function being optimized: Ln\nB\nfor binary objective, and Ln R for ranking objective. Binary objective essentially corresponds to a problem where the scoring function s(x, y; \u2713) is used to construct a binary classifier that discriminates between positive and negative examples. Ranking objective corresponds to a problem where the scoring function s(x, y; \u2713) is used to rank the true label y(i) above negative examples y(i,1) . . . y(i,K) for the input x(i). Our main result is as follows:\nTheorem 3.1 (Informal: see section 4 for a for-\nmal statement.)

Intuitively as n increases Ln\nR (\u2713) converges to L1 R\n(\u2713), and the output to the algorithm converges to \u27130 such that p(y|x; \u27130) = p\nY |X(y|x) for all x, y. Section 4 gives a formal argument.\nWe now give a proof sketch for theorem 3.2. Consider the algorithm in figure 1. For convenience define y\u0304(i) to be the vector (y(i,0), y(i,1), . . . , y(i,K)).

The first identity states that the objective function is the expectation of the negative crossentropy w.r.t. the density function 1\nK+1\u21b5(x, y\u0304) (see Section B.1.1 of the supplementary material for derivation):\nL1 R (\u2713) = X\nx\nX\ny\u0304\n1\nK + 1 \u21b5(x, y\u0304)C(x, y\u0304; \u2713). (5)\nThe second identity concerns the relationship between q(\u00b7|x, y\u0304; \u2713) and (\u00b7|x, y\u0304). Under assumption 2.1, for all x, y\u0304, k 2 {0 . . .K},\nq(k|x, y\u0304; \u2713\u21e4)\n=\np Y |X(y\u0304k|x)Z(x; \u2713\u21e4)/pN (yk)\nP\nK k=0 pY |X(y\u0304k|x)Z(x; \u2713\u21e4)/pN (yk) = (k|x, y\u0304) (6)\nIt follows immediately through the properties of negative cross entropy that\n8x, y\u0304, \u2713\u21e4 2 argmax \u2713 C(x, y\u0304; \u2713) (7)\nThe remainder of the argument is as follows: \u2022 Eqs. 7 and 5 imply that \u2713\u21e4 2 argmax\n\u2713 L1 R\n(\u2713). \u2022 Assumption 2.1 implies that \u21b5(x, y\u0304) > 0 for\nall x, y\u0304. It follows that any \u27130 2 argmax \u2713 L1 R\n(\u2713) satisfies\nfor all x, y\u0304, k, (8) q(k|x, y\u0304; \u27130) = q(k|x, y\u0304; \u2713\u21e4) = (k|x, y\u0304)\nOtherwise there would be some x, y\u0304 such that C(x, y\u0304; \u27130) < C(x, y\u0304; \u2713\u21e4). \u2022 Eq. 8 implies that 8x, y, p(y|x; \u27130) = p(y|x; \u2713\u21e4). See the proof of lemma B.3 in the supplementary material.\nIn summary, the identity in Eq. 5 is key: the objective function in the limit, L1\nR (\u2713), is related to a negative cross-entropy between the underlying distribution (\u00b7|x, y\u0304) and a distribution under the parameters, q(\u00b7|x, y\u0304; \u2713). The parameters \u2713\u21e4 maximize this negative cross entropy over the space of all distributions {q(\u00b7|x, y\u0304; \u2713), \u2713 2 \u21e5}."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Algorithms in Previous Work", "text": "To motivate the importance of the two algorithms, we now discuss their application in previous work.\nMnih and Teh (2012) consider language modeling, where x = w1w2 . . . wn 1 is a history consisting of the previous n 1 words, and y is a word. The scoring function is defined as\ns(x, y; \u2713) = ( n 1 X\ni=1\nC i r w\ni\n) \u00b7 q y + b y c x\nwhere r w\ni is an embedding (vector of parameters) for history word w\ni , q y is an embedding (vector of parameters) for word y, each C\ni for i = 1 . . . n 1 is a matrix of parameters specifying the contribution of r\nw\ni\nto the history representation, b y is a bias term for word y, and c\nx is a parameter corresponding to the log normalization term for history x. Thus each history x has its own parameter c\nx . The binary objective function is used in the NCE algorithm. The noise distribution p\nN (y) is set to be the unigram distribution over words in the vocabulary.\nThis method is a direct application of the original NCE method to conditional estimation, through introduction of the parameters c\nx corresponding to normalization terms for each history. Interestingly, Mnih and Teh (2012) acknowledge the difficulties in maintaining a separate parameter c\nx for each history, and set c x = 0 for all x, noting that empirically this works well, but without giving justification.\nMikolov et al. (2013) consider an NCE-based method using the binary objective function for estimation of word embeddings. The skip-gram method described in the paper corresponds to a model where x is a word, and y is a word in the context. The vector v\nx is the embedding for word x, and the vector v0\ny is an embedding for word y (separate embeddings are used for x and y). The method they describe uses\ns\u0304(x, y; \u2713) = v0 y \u00b7 v x\nor equivalently\ns(x, y; \u2713) = v0 y \u00b7 v x + log p N (y)\nThe negative-sampling distribution p N (y) was chosen as the unigram distribution p\nY (y) raised to the power 3/4. The end goal of the method was to learn useful embeddings v\nw and v0 w for each word\nin the vocabulary; however the method gives a consistent estimate for a model of the form\np(y|x) = exp\nv0 y \u00b7 v x + log p N (y)\nP\ny\nexp v0 y \u00b7 v x + log p N (y)\n=\np N (y) exp v0 y \u00b7 v x\nZ(x; \u2713)\nassuming that Assumption 2.2 holds, i.e. Z(x; \u2713) = P\ny\np N (y) exp v0 y \u00b7 v x \u2318 H(\u2713) which does not vary with x.\nLevy and Goldberg (2014) make a connection between the NCE-based method of (Mikolov et al., 2013), and factorization of a matrix of pointwise mutual information (PMI) values of (x, y) pairs. Consistency of the NCE-based method under assumption 2.2 implies a similar result, specifically: if we define p\nN (y) = p Y (y), and define s(x, y; \u2713) = v0\ny\n\u00b7 v x + log p N (y) implying s\u0304(x, y; \u2713) = v0\ny\n\u00b7 v x , then parameters v0 y and v x\nconverge to values such that\np(y|x) = p Y (y) exp\nv0 y \u00b7 v x\nH(\u2713)\nor equivalently\nPMI(x, y) = log p(y|x) p(y) = v0 y \u00b7 v x logH(\u2713)\nThat is, following (Levy and Goldberg, 2014), the inner product v0\ny\n\u00b7 v x is an estimate of the PMI up to a constant offset H(\u2713).\nFinally, Jozefowicz et al. (2016) introduce the ranking-based variant of NCE for the language modeling problem. This is the same as the ranking-based algorithm in figure 1. They do not, however, make the connection to assumptions 2.2 and 2.1, or derive the consistency or efficiency results in the current paper. Jozefowicz et al. (2016) partially motivate the ranking-based variant throught the importance sampling viewpoint of Bengio and Sene\u0301cal (2008). However there are two critical differences: 1) the algorithm of Bengio and Sene\u0301cal (2008) does not lead to the same objective Ln\nR in the ranking-based variant of NCE; instead it uses importance sampling to derive an objective that is similar but not identical; 2) the importance sampling method leads to a biased estimate of the gradients of the log-likelihood function, with the bias going to zero only as K ! 1. In contrast the theorems in the current paper show that the NCE-based methods are consistent for any\nvalue of K. In summary, while it is tempting to view the ranking variant of NCE as an importance sampling method, the NCE-based view gives stronger guarantees for finite values of K."}, {"heading": "4 Theory", "text": "This section states the main theorems.

It is natural to ask: does such scalability come at a cost? Classical likelihood theory tells us, under mild conditions, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has nice properties like asymptotic normality and Fisher efficiency. More specifically, as the sample size goes\nto infinity, the distribution of the MLE will converge to a multivariate normal distribution, and the mean square error of the MLE will achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound (Ferguson, 1996).\nWe have shown the consistency of the NCE estimators in Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4.

For a fixed sample size, the NCE estimators become comparable to MLE as K increases. \u2022 The larger the sample size, the less sensitive are the NCE estimators to K. A very small value of K seems to suffice for large sample size.\nApparently, under the parametrization above, the model is not self-normalized. To use NCEbinary, we add an extra x-dependent bias parameter b\nx to the score function (i.e. s(x, y; \u2713) = x0\u2713 y +\nb x ) to make the model self-normalized or else the algorithm will not be consistent. Similar patterns to figure 2 are observed when varying sample size and K (see Section A.1 of the supplementary material). However this makes NCE-binary not directly comparable to NCE-ranking/MLE since its performance will be compromised by estimating extra parameters and the number of extra parameters depends on the richness of the feature space X . To make this clear, we fix n = 16000, d = 4,m\ny = 100,K = 32 and experiment with m x = 100, 200, 300, 400. The results are summarized on the right panel of figure 2. As |X | increases, the KL divergence will grow while the performance of NCE-ranking/MLE is independent of |X |. Without the x-dependent bias term for NCE-binary, the KL divergence will be much higher due to lack of consistency (0.19, 0.21, 0.24, 0.26 respectively)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Language Modeling", "text": "We evaluate the performance of the two NCE algorithms on a language modeling problem, using the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset (Marcus et al., 1993).

As shown in the table, the performance of NCE-ranking and NCE-binary improves as the number of negative examples increases, and finally outperforms the MLE.\nAn interesting observation is, without regularization, the binary classification approach outperforms both ranking and MLE. This suggests the model space (two-layer LSTMs) is rich enough as to approximately incorporate the x-dependent partition function Z(\u2713;x), thus making the model approximately self-normalized.

Conditional models are frequently encountered in practice; however there has not been a rigorous theoretical analysis of NCE in this setting, and we will argue there are subtle but important questions when generalizing NCE to the conditional case. In particular, we analyze two variants of NCE for conditional models: one based on a classification objective, the other based on a ranking objective. We show that the rankingbased variant of NCE gives consistent parameter estimates under weaker assumptions than the classification-based method; we analyze the statistical efficiency of the ranking-based and classification-based variants of NCE; finally we describe experiments on synthetic data and language modeling showing the effectiveness and trade-offs of both methods.", "title": "Noise Contrastive Estimation and Negative Sampling for Conditional Models: Consistency and Statistical Efficiency"}
