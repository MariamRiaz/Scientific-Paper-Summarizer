"When translating between two languages that differ in their degree of morphological synthesis, syntactic structures in one language may be realized as morphological structures in the other.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Machine Translation models that treat words as atomic units have poor learning capabilities for such translation units, and morphological segmentations are commonly used (Koehn and Knight, 2003).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Like words in a sentence, the morphemes of a word have a hierarchical structure that is relevant in translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, compounds in Germanic languages are head-final, and the head is the segment that determines agreement within the noun phrase, and is relevant for selectional preferences of verbs.

"In example 1, agreement in case, number and gender is enforced between eine ’a’ and Gebühr ’fee’, and selectional preference between erheben ’charge’ and Gebühr ’fee’.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A flat representation, as is common in phrase-based SMT, does not encode these relationships, but a dependency representation does so through dependency links.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we investigate a dependency representation of morphologically segmented words for SMT.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our representation encodes syntactic and morphological structure jointly, allowing a single model to learn the translation of both.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we work with a string-to-tree model with GHKM-style rules (Galley et al., 2006), and a relational dependency language model (Sennrich, 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We focus on the representation of German syntax and morphology in an English-to-German system, and two morphologically complex word classes in German that are challenging for translation, compounds and particle verbs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"German makes heavy use of compounding, and compounds such as Abwasserbehandlungsanlage ‘waste water treatment plant’ are translated into complex noun phrases in other languages, such as French station d’épuration des eaux résiduaires.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
German particle verbs are difficult to model because their surface realization differs depending on the finiteness of the verb and the type of clause.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Verb particles are separated from the finite verb in
2081
main clauses, but prefixed to the verb in subordinated clauses, or when the verb is non-finite.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The infinitive marker zu ’to’, which is normally a premodifying particle, appears as an infix in particle verbs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows an illustrating example.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The main focus of research on compound splitting has been on the splitting algorithm (Popovic et al., 2006; Nießen and Ney, 2000; Weller et al., 2014; Macherey et al., 2011).",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Our focus is not the splitting algorithm, but the representation of compounds.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"For splitting, we use an approach similar to (Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010), with segmentation candidates identified by a finite-state morphology (Schmid et al., 2004; Sennrich and Kunz, 2014), and statistical evidence from the training corpus to select a split (Koehn and Knight, 2003).
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"German compounds are head-final, and premodifiers can be added recursively.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
Compounds are structurally ambiguous if there is more than one modifier.,2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
Consider the distinction between (Stadtteil)projekt (literally: ’(city part) project)’) and Stadt(teilprojekt) ’city sub-project’.,2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"We opt for a left-branching representation by default.1 We also split linking elements, and represent them as a postmodifier of each non-final segment, including the empty string ("" "").",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"We use the same representation for noun compounds and adjective compounds.
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
An example of the original2 and the proposed compound representation is shown in Figure 1.,2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Importantly, the head of the compound is also the parent of the determiners and attributes in the noun phrase, which makes a bigram dependency language model sufficient to enforce agreement.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Since we model morphosyntactic agreement within the main translation step, and not in a separate step as in (Fraser et al., 2012), we deem it useful that inflection is marked at the head of the compound.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Consequently, we do not split off inflectional or derivational morphemes.
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"For German particle verbs, we define a common representation that abstracts away from the various surface realizations (see Table 1).",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Separated
1We follow prior work in leaving frequent words or subwords unsplit, which has a disambiguating effect.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"With more aggressive splitting, frequency information could be used for the structural disambiguation of internal structure.
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"2The original dependency trees follow the annotation guidelines by Foth (2005).
verb particles are reordered to be the closest premodifier of the verb.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Prefixed particles and the zuinfix are identified by the finite-state-morphology, and split from the verb so that the particle is the closest, the zu marker the next-closest premodifier of the verb, as shown in Figure 2.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Agreement, selectional preferences, and other phenomena involve the verb and its dependents, and the proposed representation retains these dependency links, but reduces data sparsity from affixation and avoids discontinuity of the verb and its particle.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"We follow Williams et al. (2014) and map dependency trees into a constituency representation, which allows for the extraction of GHKM-style translation rules (Galley et al., 2006).",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"This conversion is lossless, and we can still apply a de-
pendency language model (RDLM).",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Figure 3 (a) shows the constituency representation of the example in Figure 1.
",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Our model should not only be able to produce new words productively, but also to memorize words it has observed during training.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Looking at the compound Handgepäckgebühr in Figure 3 (a), we can see that it does not form a constituent, and cannot be extracted with GHKM extraction heuristics.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"To address this, we binarize the trees in our training data (Wang et al., 2007).
",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
A complicating factor is that the binarization should not impair the RDLM.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"During decoding, we map the internal tree structure of each hypothesis back to the unbinarized form, which is then scored by the RDLM.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
Virtual nodes introduced by the binarization must also be scorable by RDLM if they form the root of a translation hypothesis.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
A simple right or left binarization would produce virtual nodes without head and without meaningful dependency representation.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
We ensure that each virtual node dominates the head of the full constituent through a mixed binarization.3,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we perform right binarization of the head and all pre-modifiers, then left binarization of all post-modifiers.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"This head-binarized representation is illustrated in Figure 3 (b).4
Head binarization ensures that even hypotheses whose root is a virtual node can be scored by the RDLM.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"This score is only relevant for pruning, and discarded when the full constituent is scored.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Still, these hypotheses require special treatment in the RDLM to mitigate search errors.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"The virtual node labels (such as OBJA) are unknown symbols to the RDLM, and we simply replace them with the original label (OBJA).",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"The RDLM uses sibling context, and this is normally padded with special start and stop symbols, analogous to BOS/EOS symbols in n-gram models.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
These start and stop symbols let the RDLM compute the probability that a node is the first or last child of its ancestor node.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"However, computing these probabilities for virtual nodes would unfairly bias the search, since the first/last child of a virtual node is not necessarily the first/last child of the full constituent.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"We adapt the representation of virtual nodes in
3In other words, every node is a fixed well-formed dependency structure (Shen et al., 2010) with our binarization.
",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"4Note that our definition of head binarization is different from that of Wang et al. (2007), who left-binarize a node if the head is the first child, and right-binarize otherwise.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Our algorithm also covers cases where the head has both pre- and post-modifiers, as erheben and gepäck do in Figure 3.
RDLM to take this into account.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"We distinguish between virtual nodes based on whether their span is a string prefix, suffix, or infix of the full constituent.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"For prefixes and infixes, we do not add a stop symbol at the end, and use null symbols, which denote unavailable context, for padding to the right.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"For suffixes and infixes, we do the same at the start.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"For SMT, all German training and development data is converted into the representation described in sections 2–3.",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"To restore the original representation, we start from the tree output of the stringto-tree decoder.",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"Merging compounds is trivial: all segments and linking elements can be identified by the tree structure, and are concatenated.
",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"For verbs that dominate a verb particle, the original order is restored through three rules:
1. non-finite verbs are concatenated with the particle, and zu-markers are infixed.
2. finite verbs that head a subordinated clause (identified by its dependency label) are concatenated with the particle.

particle moved to the right clause",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]

Previous work on particle verb translation into German proposed to predict the position of particles with an n-gram language model (Nießen and Ney, 2001).",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"Our rules have the advantage that they are informed by the syntax of the sentence and consider the finiteness of the verb.
",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
Our rules only produce projective trees.,4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"Verb particles may also appear in positions that violate projectivity, and we leave it to future research to determine if our limitation to projective trees affects translation quality, and how to produce nonprojective trees.",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
We train English–German string-to-tree SMT systems on the training data of the shared translation task of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) 2015.,5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
"The data set consists of 4.2 million sentence pairs of parallel data, and 160 million sentences of monolingual German data.

"Additionally, our baseline system contains a dependency language model (RDLM) (Sennrich, 2015), trained on the target-side of the parallel training data.

"We report case-sensitive BLEU scores on the newstest2014/5 test sets from WMT, averaged over 3 optimization runs of k-batch MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012) on a subset of newstest2008-12.6

"For comparison with the state-of-the-art, we train a full system on our restructured representation, which incorporates all models and settings of our WMT 2015 submission system (Williams et al., 2015).7 Note that our WMT 2015 submission

"7In contrast to our other systems in this paper, RDLM is trained on all monolingual data for the full system, and two models are added: a 5-gram Neural Network language model
uses the dependency representation of compounds and tree binarization introduced in this paper; we achieve additional gains over the submission system through particle verb restructuring.",5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows translation quality (BLEU) with different representations of German compounds and particle verbs.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"Head binarization not only yields improvements over the baseline, but also allows for larger gains from morphological segmentation.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"We attribute this to the fact that full compounds, and prefixed particle verbs, are not always a constituent in the segmented representation, and that binarization compensates this theoretical drawback.
",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"With head binarization, we find substantial improvements from compound splitting of 0.7–1.1 BLEU.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"On newstest2014, the improvement is almost twice of that reported in related work (Williams et al., 2014), which also uses a hierarchical representation of compounds, albeit one that does not allow for dependency modelling.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]

Particle verb restructuring yields additional gains of 0.1–0.4 BLEU.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"One reason for the smaller effect of particle verb restructuring is that the difficult cases – separated particle verbs and those with infixation – are rarer than compounds, with 2841 rare compounds [that would be split by our compound splitter] in the reference texts, in contrast to 553 separated particle verbs, and 176 particle verbs with infixation, as Table 3 illustrates.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"If we only evaluate the sentences containing a particle verb with zu-infix in the reference, 165 in total for newstest2014/5, we observe an improvement of 0.8 BLEU on this subset (22.1→22.9), significant with p < 0.05.
",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
The positive effect of restructuring is also apparent in frequency statistics.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows that the baseline system severely undergenerates compounds and separated/infixed particle verbs.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"Binarization, compound splitting, and particle verb restructuring all contribute to bringing the distribution of compounds and particle verbs closer to the reference.
",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"In total, the restructured representation yields improvements of 1.4–1.8 BLEU over our baseline.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
The full system is competitive with official submissions to the WMT 2015 shared translation tasks.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"It outperforms our submission (Williams et al., 2015) by 0.4 BLEU, and outperforms other phrase-based and syntax-based submissions by 0.8 BLEU or more.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"The best reported result according to BLEU is an ensemble of Neural MT systems (Jean et al., 2015), which achieves 24.9 BLEU.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"In the human evaluation, both our submission and the Neural MT system were ranked 1–2 (out of 16), with no significant difference between them.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
We perform a synthetic experiment to test our claim that a dependency representation allows for the modelling of agreement between morphemes.,5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"For 200 rare compounds [that would be split by our compound splitter] in the newstest2014/5 references, we artificially introduce agreement errors by changing the gender of the determiner.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"For instance, we create the erroneous sentence sie erheben ein Handgepäckgebühr as a complement to Example 1.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
We measure the ability of language models to prefer (give a higher probability to) the original reference sentence over the erroneous one.,5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"In the original representation, both a Kneser-

"Ney 5-gram LM and RDLM perform poorly due to data sparseness, with 70% and 57.5% accuracy, respectively.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"In the split representation, the RDLM reliably prefers the correct agreement (96.5% accuracy), whilst the performance of the 5-gram model even deteriorates (to 60% accuracy).",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"This is because the gender of the first segment(s) is irrelevant, or even misleading, for agreement.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"For instance, Handgepäck is neuter, which could lead a morpheme-level n-gram model to prefer the determiner ein, but Handgepäckgebühr is feminine and requires eine.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
Our main contribution is that we exploit the hierarchical structure of morphemes to model them jointly with syntax in a dependency-based stringto-tree SMT model.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We describe the dependency annotation of two morphologically complex word classes in German, compounds and particle verbs, and show that our tree representation yields improvements in translation quality of 1.4–1.8 BLEU in the WMT English–German translation task.9
The principle of jointly representing syntactic and morphological structure in dependency trees can be applied to other language pairs, and we expect this to be helpful for languages with a high degree of morphological synthesis.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"However, the annotation needs to be adapted to the respective languages.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"For example, French compounds such as arc-en-ciel ’rainbow’ are head-initial, in contrast to head-final Germanic compounds.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"The daily life of Chinese people heavily depends on Chinese input method engine (IME), no matter whether one is composing an E-mail, writing an article, or sending a text message.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"However, every Chinese word inputted into computer or cellphone cannot be typed through one-to-one mapping of key-to-letter inputting directly, but has to go through an IME as there are thousands of Chinese characters for inputting while only 26 letter keys are available in the keyboard.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]

ficient IME will largely improve the user experience of Chinese information processing.
",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
Nowadays most of Chinese IMEs are pinyin based.,1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Pinyin is originally designed as the phonetic symbol of a Chinese character (based on the standard modern Chinese, mandarin) , using Latin letters as its syllable notation.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"For example, the pinyin of the Chinese character “爱”(love) is “ài”.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Most characters usually have unique pinyin representations, while a few Chinese characters may be pronounced in several different ways, so they may have multiple pinyin representations.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
The advantage of pinyin IME is that it only adopts the pronunciation perspective of Chinese characters so that it is simple and easy to learn.,1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"But there are only less than 500 pinyin syllables in standard modern Chinese, compared with over 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters, which leads to serious ambiguities for pinyin-to-charactermapping.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Modern pinyin IMEsmostly use a “sentencebased” decoding technique (Chen and Lee, 2000) to alleviate the ambiguities.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
“Sentence based” means that IME generates a sequence of Chinese characters upon a sequence of pinyin inputs with respect to certain statistical criteria.,1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Written in Chinese characters but not alphabets, spell checking for Chinese language is quite different from the same task for other languages.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"Since Chinese characters are entered via IME, those user-made typos do not immediately lead to spelling errors.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"When a user types a wrong letter, IME will be very likely to fail to generate the expected Chinese character sequence.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"Normally, the user may immediately notice the inputting error and then make corrections, which usually means doing a bunch of extra operations like cursor
1512
movement, deletion and re-typing.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"Thus there are two separated sub-tasks for Chinese spell checking: 1. typo checking for user typed pinyin sequences which should be a built-in module in IME, and 2. spell checking for Chinese texts in its narrow sense, which is typically a module of word processing applications (Yang et al., 2012b).",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"These two terms are often confused especially in IME related works such as (Chen and Lee, 2000) and (Wu et al., 2009).
",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
Pinyin typos have always been a serious problem for Chinese pinyin IMEs.,1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[1.0],['Pinyin typos have always been a serious problem for Chinese pinyin IMEs.']
The user may fail to input the completely right pinyin simply because he/she is a dialect speaker and does not know the exact pronunciation for the expected character.,1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"This may be a very common situation since there are about seven quite different dialects in Chinese, among which being spoken languages, six are far different from the standard modern Chinese, mandarin.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"With the boom of smart-phones, pinyin typos worsen due to the limited size of soft keyboard, and the lack of physical feedback on the touch screen.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"However, existing practical IMEs only provide small patches to deal with typos such as Fuzzy Pinyin (Wu and Chen, 2004) and other language specific errors (Zheng et al., 2011b).
",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
Typo checking and correction has an important impact on IME performance.,1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[1.0],['Typo checking and correction has an important impact on IME performance.']
"When IME fails to correct a typo and generate the expected sentence, the user will have to takemuch extra effort to move the cursor back to the mistyped letter and correct it, which leads to very poor user experience (Jia and Zhao, 2013).",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"The very first approach for Chinese input with typo correction was made by (Chen and Lee, 2000), which was also the initial attempt of “sentence-based” IME.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"The idea of “statistical input method” was proposed by modeling PTC conversion as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and using Viterbi (Viterbi, 1967) algorithm to decode the sequence.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
They solved the typo correction problem by decomposing the conditional probability P (H|P ) of Chinese character sequence H given pinyin sequence P into a language model P (wi|wi−1) and a typing model P (pi|wi).,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
The typing model that was estimated on real user input data was for typo correction.,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"However, real user input data can be very noisy and not very convenient to obtain.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"As we will propose a joint model
in this paper, such an individual typing model is not necessarily built in our approach.
",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"(Zheng et al., 2011a) developed an IME system with typo correction called CHIME using noisy channel error model and language-specific features.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
However their model depended on a very strong assumption that input pinyin sequence should have been segmented into pinyin words by the user.,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
This assumption does not really hold in modern “sentence-based” IMEs.,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"We release this assumption since our model solves segmentation, typo correction and PTC conversion jointly.
",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"Besides the common HMM approach for PTC conversion, there are also variousmethods such as: support vector machine (Jiang et al., 2007), maximum entropy (ME) model (Wang et al., 2006), conditional random field (CRF) (Li et al., 2009) and statistical machine translation (SMT) (Yang et al., 2012a; Wang et al., 2013c; Zhang and Zhao, 2013), etc.

"Spell checking or typo checking was first proposed for English (Peterson, 1980).",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"(Mays et al., 1991) addressed that spell checking should be done within a context, i.e., a sentence or a long phrase with a certain meaning, instead of only in one word.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"A recent spell correction work is (Li et al., 2006), where a distributional similarity was introduced for spell correction of web queries.
",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"Early attempts for Chinese spelling checking could date back to (Chang, 1994) where character tables for similar shape, pronunciation, meaning, and input-method-code characters were proposed.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"More recently, the 7th SIGHANWorkshop on Chinese Language Processing (Yu et al., 2013) held a shared task on Chinese spell checking.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"Various approaches were made for the task including language model (LM) based methods (Chen et al., 2013), ME model (Han and Chang, 2013), CRF (Wang et al., 2013d; Wang et al., 2013a), SMT (Chiu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013), and graph model (Jia et al., 2013), etc.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]

"With all parameters optimized, results on T
using the proposed joint model are shown in Table 3 and Table 4.",4.4 PTC Conversion with Typo Correction,[0],[0]
Our results are compared to the baseline system without typo correction and Google Input Tool.,4.4 PTC Conversion with Typo Correction,[0],[0]
"Since sunpinyin does not have typo correction module and performs much poorer than our baseline system, we do not include it in the comparison.",4.4 PTC Conversion with Typo Correction,[0],[0]
"Though no direct proofs can be found to indicate if Google Input Tool has an independent typo correction component, its outputs show that such a component is unlikely available.
",4.4 PTC Conversion with Typo Correction,[0],[0]
Since Google Input Tool has to be accessed through a web interface and the network connection cannot be guaranteed.,4.4 PTC Conversion with Typo Correction,[0],[0]
"we only take a subset of 10K sentences of T to perform the experiments, and the results are shown in Table 3.

"Additionally, to further inspect the robustness of ourmodel, performance with typo rate ranges from 0% to 5% is shown in Figure 12.",4.4 PTC Conversion with Typo Correction,[0],[0]
"Although the performance decreases while typo rate goes up, it is still quite satisfying around typo rate of 2% which is assumed to be the real world situation.",4.4 PTC Conversion with Typo Correction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we have developed a joint graph model for pinyin-to-Chinese conversion with typo correction.",5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
This model finds a joint global optimal for typo correction and PTC conversion on the entire input pinyin sequence.,5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
The evaluation results show that our model outperforms both previous academic systems and existing commercial products.,5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
