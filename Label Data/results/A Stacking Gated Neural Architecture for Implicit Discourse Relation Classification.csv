"Despite this empirical progress, the precise mechanisms by which deep learning works so well remain relatively poorly understood, adding an air of mystery to the entire field.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Ongoing attempts to build a rigorous mathematical framework fall roughly into five camps: (i) probing and measuring DNs to visualize their inner workings (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014); (ii) analyzing their properties such as expressive power (Cohen et al., 2016), loss surface geometry (Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017; Soudry & Hoffer, 2017), nuisance management (Soatto & Chiuso, 2016), sparsification (Papyan et al., 2017), and generalization abilities; (iii) new mathematical frameworks that share some (but not all) common features with DNs (Bruna & Mallat, 2013); (iv) probabilistic generative models from which specific DNs can be derived (Arora et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2016); and (v) information theoretic bounds (Tishby & Zaslavsky, 2015).

"In this paper, we build a rigorous bridge between DNs and approximation theory via spline functions and operators.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We prove that a large class of DNs — including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (LeCun, 1998), residual networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016; Targ et al., 2016), skip connection networks (Srivastava et al., 2015), fully connected networks (Pal & Mitra, 1992), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Graves, 2013), and beyond — can be written as spline operators.",1.

The max-affine spline connection provides a powerful portal through which to view and analyze the inner workings of a DN using tools from approximation theory and functional analysis.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here is a summary of our key contributions:
[C1] We prove that a large class of DNs can be written as a composition of MASOs, from which it follows immediately that, conditioned on the input signal, the output of a DN is a simple affine transformation of the input.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We illustrate in Section 4 by deriving a closed-form expression for the
input/output mapping of a CNN.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"[C2] The affine mapping formula enables us to interpret a MASO DN as constructing a set of signal-dependent, classspecific templates against which the signal is compared via a simple inner product.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 5 we relate DNs directly to the classical theory of optimal classification via matched filters and provide insights into the effects of data memorization (Zhang et al., 2016).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
[C3] We propose a simple penalty term that can be added to the cost function of any DN learning algorithm to force the templates to be orthogonal to each other.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 6, we show that this leads to significantly improved classification performance and reduced overfitting on standard test data sets like CIFAR100 with no change to the DN architecture.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"[C4] The partition of the input space induced by a MASO links DNs to the theory of vector quantization (VQ) and K-means clustering, which opens up a new geometric avenue to study how DNs cluster and organize signals in a hierarchical fashion.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Section 7 studies the properties of the MASO partition.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"[C5] Leveraging the fact that a DN considers two signals to be similar if they lie in the same MASO partition region, we develop a new signal distance in Section 7.3 that measures the difference between their partition encodings.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The distance is easily computed via backpropagation.
