"Ongoing attempts to build a rigorous mathematical framework fall roughly into five camps: (i) probing and measuring DNs to visualize their inner workings (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014); (ii) analyzing their properties such as expressive power (Cohen et al., 2016), loss surface geometry (Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017; Soudry & Hoffer, 2017), nuisance management (Soatto & Chiuso, 2016), sparsification (Papyan et al., 2017), and generalization abilities; (iii) new mathematical frameworks that share some (but not all) common features with DNs (Bruna & Mallat, 2013); (iv) probabilistic generative models from which specific DNs can be derived (Arora et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2016); and (v) information theoretic bounds (Tishby & Zaslavsky, 2015).

"We prove that a large class of DNs — including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (LeCun, 1998), residual networks (ResNets) (He et al., 2016; Targ et al., 2016), skip connection networks (Srivastava et al., 2015), fully connected networks (Pal & Mitra, 1992), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Graves, 2013), and beyond — can be written as spline operators.",1.

The max-affine spline connection provides a powerful portal through which to view and analyze the inner workings of a DN using tools from approximation theory and functional analysis.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here is a summary of our key contributions:
[C1] We prove that a large class of DNs can be written as a composition of MASOs, from which it follows immediately that, conditioned on the input signal, the output of a DN is a simple affine transformation of the input.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We illustrate in Section 4 by deriving a closed-form expression for the
input/output mapping of a CNN.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"[C2] The affine mapping formula enables us to interpret a MASO DN as constructing a set of signal-dependent, classspecific templates against which the signal is compared via a simple inner product.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 5 we relate DNs directly to the classical theory of optimal classification via matched filters and provide insights into the effects of data memorization (Zhang et al., 2016).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
[C3] We propose a simple penalty term that can be added to the cost function of any DN learning algorithm to force the templates to be orthogonal to each other.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 6, we show that this leads to significantly improved classification performance and reduced overfitting on standard test data sets like CIFAR100 with no change to the DN architecture.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"[C4] The partition of the input space induced by a MASO links DNs to the theory of vector quantization (VQ) and K-means clustering, which opens up a new geometric avenue to study how DNs cluster and organize signals in a hierarchical fashion.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Section 7 studies the properties of the MASO partition.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"[C5] Leveraging the fact that a DN considers two signals to be similar if they lie in the same MASO partition region, we develop a new signal distance in Section 7.3 that measures the difference between their partition encodings.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The distance is easily computed via backpropagation.

A verb plays a primary role in conveying the meaning of a sentence.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Capturing the sense of a verb is essential for natural language processing (NLP), and thus lexical resources for verbs play an important role in NLP.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Verb classes are one such lexical resource.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Manually-crafted verb classes have been developed, such as Levin’s classes (Levin, 1993) and their extension, VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), in which verbs are organized into classes on the basis of their syntactic and semantic behavior.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such verb classes have been used in many NLP applications that need to consider semantics in particular, such as word sense disambiguation (Dang, 2004), semantic parsing (Swier and Stevenson, 2005; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005) and discourse parsing (Subba and Di Eugenio, 2009).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There have also been many attempts to automatically acquire verb classes with the goal of ei-
ther adding frequency information to an existing resource or of inducing similar verb classes for other languages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most of these approaches assume that all target verbs are monosemous (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006; Joanis et al., 2008; Li and Brew, 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Sun and Korhonen, 2009; Vlachos et al., 2009; Parisien and Stevenson, 2010; Parisien and Stevenson, 2011; Falk et al., 2012; Lippincott et al., 2012; Reichart and Korhonen, 2013; Sun et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This monosemous assumption, however, is not realistic because many frequent verbs actually have multiple senses.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of the following approaches attempt to quantitatively evaluate soft clusterings of verb classes induced by polysemy-aware unsupervised approaches (Korhonen et al., 2003; Lapata and Brew, 2004; Li and Brew, 2007; Schulte im Walde et al., 2008).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for inducing verb classes that is aware of verb polysemy.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our method consists of two clustering steps: verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"By taking this step-wise approach, we can not only induce verb classes with frequency information from a massive amount of verb uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our novel contributions are summarized as follows:
• induce both semantic frames and verb classes from a massive amount of verb uses by a scalable method,
• explicitly deal with verb polysemy, • discover effective features for each of the
clustering steps, and
• quantitatively evaluate a soft clustering of verbs.

"As stated in Section 1, most of the previous studies on verb clustering assume that verbs are monosemous.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"A typical method in these studies is to represent each verb as a single data point and apply classification (e.g., Joanis et al. (2008)) or clustering (e.g., Sun and Korhonen (2009)) to these data points.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As a representation for a data point, distributions of subcategorization frames are often used, and other semantic features (e.g., selectional preferences) are sometimes added to improve the performance.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Among these studies on monosemous verb clustering (i.e., predominant class induction), there have been several Bayesian methods.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Vlachos et al. (2009) proposed a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM; Neal (2000)) to cluster verbs based on subcategorization frame distributions.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"They evaluated their result with a gold-standard test set, where a single class is assigned to a verb.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Parisien and Stevenson (2010) proposed a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP; Teh et al. (2006)) model to jointly learn argument structures (subcategorization frames) and verb classes by using syntactic features.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Parisien and Stevenson (2011) extended their model by adding semantic features.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
They tried to account for verb learning by children and did not evaluate the resultant verb classes.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Modi et al. (2012) extended the model of Titov and Klementiev (2012), which is an unsupervised model for inducing semantic roles, to jointly induce semantic roles and frames across verbs using the Chinese Restaurant Process (Aldous, 1985).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"All of the above methods considered verbs to be monosemous and did not deal with verb polysemy.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our approach also uses Bayesian methods, but is designed to capture verb polysemy.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We summarize a few studies that consider polysemy of verbs in the rest of this section.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Miyao and Tsujii (2009) proposed a supervised method that can handle verb polysemy.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their method represents a verb’s syntactic and semantic features, and learns a log-linear model from the SemLink corpus (Loper et al., 2007).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Boleda et al. (2007) also proposed a supervised method for Catalan adjectives considering the polysemy of adjectives.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The most closely related work to our polysemyaware task of unsupervised verb class induction is the work of Korhonen et al. (2003), who used distributions of subcategorization frames to cluster verbs.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
They adopted the Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Information Bottleneck (IB) methods for clustering.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In particular, they tried to consider verb polysemy by using the IB method, which is a soft clustering method (Tishby et al., 1999).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, the verb itself is still represented as a single data point.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"After performing soft clustering, they noted that most verbs fell into a single class, and they decided to assign a single class to each verb by hardening the clustering.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
They considered multiple classes only in the gold-standard data used for their evaluations.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We also evaluate our induced verb classes on this gold-standard data, which was created on the basis of Levin’s classes (Levin, 1993).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Lapata and Brew (2004) and Li and Brew (2007) proposed probabilistic models for calculating prior probabilities of verb classes for a verb.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These models are approximated to condition not
on verbs but on subcategorization frames.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As mentioned in Li and Brew (2007), it is desirable to extend the model to depend on verbs to further improve accuracy.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"They conducted several evaluations including predominant class induction and token-level verb sense disambiguation, but did not evaluate multiple classes output by their models.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Schulte im Walde et al. (2008) also applied probabilistic soft clustering to verbs by incorporating subcategorization frames and selectional preferences based on WordNet.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
This model is based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Minimum Description Length principle.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Since they focused on the incorporation of selectional preferences, they did not evaluate verb classes but evaluated only selectional preferences using a language model-based measure.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Materna proposed LDA-frames, which are defined across verbs and can be considered to be a kind of verb class (Materna, 2012; Materna, 2013).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
LDA-frames are probabilistic semantic frames automatically induced from a raw corpus.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"He used a model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; Blei et al. (2003)) and the Dirichlet process to cluster verb instances of a triple (subject, verb, object) to produce semantic frames and roles.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Both of these are represented as a probabilistic distribution of words across verbs.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"He applied this method to the BNC and acquired 1,200 frames and 400 roles (Materna, 2012).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"He did not evaluate the resulting frames as verb classes.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In sum, there have been no studies that quantitatively evaluate polysemous verb classes automatically induced by unsupervised methods.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Our objective is to automatically learn semantic frames and verb classes from a massive amount of verb uses following usage-based approaches.,3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Although Bayesian approaches are a possible solution to simultaneously induce frames and verb classes from a corpus as used in previous studies, it has prohibitive computational cost.",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"For instance, Parisien and Stevenson applied HDP only to a small-scale child speech corpus that contains 170K verb uses to jointly induce subcategorization frames and verb classes (Parisien and Stevenson, 2010; Parisien and Stevenson, 2011).",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Materna applied an LDA-based method to the BNC, which contains 1.4M verb uses, to induce seman-
tic frames across verbs that can be considered to be verb classes (Materna, 2012; Materna, 2013).",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"However, it would take three months for this experiment using this 100 million word corpus.1 Although it is best to use the largest possible corpus for this kind of knowledge acquisition tasks (Sasano et al., 2009), it is infeasible to scale to giga-word corpora using such joint models.
",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose a two-step approach for inducing semantic frames and verb classes.",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"First, we make multiple data points for each verb to deal with verb polysemy (cf. polysemy-aware previous studies still represented a verb as one data point (Korhonen et al., 2003; Miyao and Tsujii, 2009)).",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"To do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses.",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Then, we induce verb classes by clustering these verbspecific semantic frames across verbs.",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"An interesting point here is that we can use exactly the same method for these two clustering steps.
",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Our procedure to automatically induce verb classes from verb uses is summarized as follows:
1.",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering predicate-argument structures for each verb extracted from automatic parses as shown in the lower part of Figure 1, and
2.",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"induce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1.
",3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
Each of these two steps is described in the following sections in detail.,3.1 Overview,[0],[0]
We induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al. (2014).,3.2 Inducing Verb-specific Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
"Our semantic frames consist of case slots, each of which consists of word instances that can be filled.",3.2 Inducing Verb-specific Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
"The procedure for inducing these semantic frames is as follows:

"apply dependency parsing to a raw corpus and extract predicate-argument structures for each verb from the automatic parses,

"apply clustering to the initial frames based on the Chinese Restaurant Process (Aldous, 1985) to produce verb-specific semantic frames.
",3.2 Inducing Verb-specific Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
These three steps are briefly described below.,3.2 Inducing Verb-specific Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
We apply dependency parsing to a large raw corpus.,3.2.1 Extracting Predicate-argument Structures from a Raw Corpus,[0],[0]
"We use the Stanford parser with Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006).2 Collapsed dependencies are adopted to directly extract prepositional phrases.

"Dependents that have the following dependency relations to a verb are extracted as arguments:

",3.2.1 Extracting Predicate-argument Structures from a Raw Corpus,[0],[0]
Predicate-argument structures are collected for each verb and the subsequent processes are applied to the predicate-argument structures of each verb.,3.2.1 Extracting Predicate-argument Structures from a Raw Corpus,[0],[0]
"To make the computation feasible, we merge the predicate-argument structures that have the same or similar meaning to get initial frames.",3.2.2 Constructing Initial Frames from Predicate-argument Structures,[0],[0]
These initial frames are the input of the subsequent clustering process.,3.2.2 Constructing Initial Frames from Predicate-argument Structures,[0],[0]
"For this merge, we assume one sense per collocation (Yarowsky, 1993) for predicateargument structures.

dobj, ccomp, nsubj, prep ∗, iobj.",3.2.2 Constructing Initial Frames from Predicate-argument Structures,[0],[0]

"We calculate the posterior probability of a cluster cj given an initial frame fi as follows:

where N is the number of initial frames for the target verb and n(cj) is the current number of initial frames assigned to the cluster cj .",3.2.3 Clustering Method,[0],[0]
α is a hyperparameter that determines how likely it is for a new cluster to be created.,3.2.3 Clustering Method,[0],[0]
"In this equation, the first term is the Dirichlet process prior and the second term is the likelihood of fi.
P (fi|cj) is defined based on the DirichletMultinomial distribution as follows:
P (fi|cj) = ∏ w∈V",3.2.3 Clustering Method,[0],[0]
"P (w|cj)count(fi,w), (2)
where V is the vocabulary in all case slots cooccurring with the verb and count(fi, w) is the number of w in the initial frame fi.",3.2.3 Clustering Method,[0],[0]
"The original method in Kawahara et al. (2014) defined w as pairs of slots and words, e.g., “nsubj:child” and “dobj:bird,” but does not consider slot-only features, e.g., “nsubj” and “dobj,” which ignore lexical information.",3.2.3 Clustering Method,[0],[0]

We use Gibbs sampling to realize this clustering.,3.2.3 Clustering Method,[0],[0]
"To induce verb classes across verbs, we apply clustering to the induced verb-specific semantic
frames.",3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
We can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb.,3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
"This is because an initial frame has the same structure as a semantic frame, which is produced by merging initial frames.",3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
"We regard each output cluster as a verb class this time.
",3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
"For the features, w, in equation (2), we try the two representations again: slot-only features and slot-word pair features.",3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
The representation using only slots corresponds to the consideration of only syntactic argument patterns.,3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
The other representation using the slot-word pairs means that semantic similarity based on word overlap is naturally considered by looking at lexical information.,3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
We will compare in our experiments four possible combinations: two feature representations for each of the two clustering steps.,3.3 Inducing Verb Classes from Semantic Frames,[0],[0]
We first describe our experimental settings and define evaluation metrics to evaluate induced soft clusterings of verb classes.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Then, we conduct type-level multi-class evaluations, type-level single-class evaluations and token-level multiclass evaluations.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
These two levels of evaluations are performed by considering the work of Reichart et al. (2010) on clustering evaluation.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Finally, we discuss the results of our full experiments.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"We use two kinds of large-scale corpora: a web corpus and the English Gigaword corpus.

We set the hyper-parameters α in (1) and β in (3) to 1.0.,4.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
The cluster assignments for all the components were initialized randomly.,4.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
We took 100 samples for each input frame and selected the cluster assignment that has the highest probability.,4.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"To measure the precision and recall of a clustering, modified purity and inverse purity (also called collocation or weighted class accuracy) are commonly used in previous studies on verb clustering (e.g., Sun and Korhonen (2009)).",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"However, since these measures are only applicable to a hard clustering, it is necessary to extend them to be applicable to a soft clustering, because in our task a verb can belong to multiple clusters or classes.4",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
We propose a normalized version of modified purity and inverse purity.,4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"This kind of normalization for soft clusterings was performed for other evaluation metrics as in Springorum et al. (2013).
",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"To measure the precision of a clustering, a normalized version of modified purity is defined as follows.",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
Suppose K is the set of automatically induced clusters and G is the set of gold classes.,4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
Let Ki be the verb vector of the i-th cluster and Gj be the verb vector of the j-th gold class.,4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"Each component of these vectors is a normalized frequency, which equals a cluster/class attribute probability given a verb.",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"Where there is no frequency information available for class distribution, such as the gold-standard data described in Section 4.3, we use a uniform distribution across the verb’s classes.",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
The core idea of purity is that each cluster Ki is associated with its most prevalent gold class.,4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"In addition, to penalize clusters that consist of only one verb, such singleton clusters in K are considered as errors, as is usual with modified purity.",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"The normalized modified purity (nmPU) can then be written as follows:
nmPU = 1 N ∑ i s.t. |Ki|>1",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"max j δKi(Ki ∩ Gj), (4)
δKi(Ki ∩ Gj) = ∑
v∈Ki∩Gj civ, (5)
",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
4Korhonen et al. (2003) evaluated hard clusterings based on a gold standard with multiple classes per verb.,4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"They reported only precision measures including modified purity, and avoided extending the evaluation metrics for soft clusterings.
where N denotes the total number of verbs, |Ki| denotes the number of positive components in Ki, and civ denotes the v-th component of Ki.",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"δKi(Ki ∩ Gj) means the total mass of the set of verbs in Ki ∩Gj , given by summing up the values in Ki.",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"In case of evaluating a hard clustering, this is equal to |Ki ∩",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"Gj | because all the values of civ are equal to 1.
",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"As usual, the following normalized inverse purity (niPU) is used to measure the recall of a clustering:
niPU = 1 N ∑",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
j max i δGj (Ki ∩ Gj).,4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"(6)
Finally, we use the harmonic mean (F1) of nmPU and niPU as a single measure of clustering quality.",4.2 Evaluation Metrics,[0],[0]
"We first evaluate our induced verb classes on the test set created by Korhonen et al. (2003) (Table 1 of their paper) which was created by considering verb polysemy on the basis of Levin’s classes and the LCS database (Dorr, 1997).",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"It consists of 62 classes and 110 verbs, out of which 35 verbs are monosemous and 75 verbs are polysemous.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]

"An excerpt from this data is shown in Table 1.
",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"As our baselines, we adopt two previously proposed methods.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
We first implemented a soft clustering method for verb class induction proposed by Korhonen et al. (2003).,4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
They used the information bottleneck (IB) method for assigning probabilities of classes to each verb.,4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Note that Korhonen et al. (2003) actually hardened the clusterings and left
the evaluations of soft clusterings for their future work.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"For input data, we employ VALEX (Korhonen et al., 2006), which is a publicly-available large-scale subcategorization lexicon.5 By following the method of Korhonen et al. (2003), prepositional phrases (pp) are parameterized for two frequent subcategorization frames (NP and NP PP), and the unfiltered raw frequencies of subcategorization frames are used as features to represent a verb.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"It is necessary to specify the number of clusters, k, for the IB method beforehand, and we adopt 35 and 42 clusters according to their reported high accuracies.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"To output multiple classes for each verb, we set a threshold, t, for class attribute probabilities.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"That is, classes that have a higher class attribute probability than the threshold are output for each verb.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"We report the results of the following threshold values: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.10.
",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"The other baseline is LDA-frames (Materna, 2012).",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"We use the induced LDA-frames that are

available on the web site.6 This frame data was induced from the BNC and consists of 1,200 frames and 400 semantic roles.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Again, we set a threshold for frame attribute probabilities.
",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
We report results using our methods with four feature combinations (slot-only (S) and slot-word pair (SW) features each used for both the framegeneration and verb-class clustering steps) for both the Gigaword and web corpora.,4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Table 2 lists evaluation results for the baseline methods and our methods.7 The results of the IB baseline and our methods are obtained by averaging five runs.
",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
We can see that “web/SW-S” achieved the best performance and obtained a higher F1 than the baselines by more than nine points.,4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
“Web/SWS” uses the combination of slot-word pair features for clustering verb-specific frames and slotonly features for clustering across verbs.,4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, this result indicates that slot distributions are more effective than lexical information in slotword pairs for inducing verb classes similar to the gold standard.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"This result is consistent with expectations, given a gold standard based on Levin’s verb classes, which are organized according to the syntactic behavior of verbs.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"The use of slot-word pairs for verb class induction generally merged too many frames into each class, apparently due to accidental word overlaps across verbs.
",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
The verb classes induced from the web corpus achieved a higher F1 than those from the Gigaword corpus.,4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
This can be attributed to the larger size of the web corpus.,4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"The employment of this kind of huge corpus is enabled by our scalable method.
",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"6http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projekty/lda-frames/ 7Although we do not think that the classes with very small attribute probabilities are meaningful, the F1 scores for lower thresholds than 0.01 converged to about 66 in the case of LDA-frames.",4.3 Type-level Multi-class Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Since we focus on the handling of verb polysemy, predominant class induction for each verb is not our main objective.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"However, we wish to compare our method with previous work on the induction of a predominant (monosemous) class for each verb.
",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"To output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"Then, we apply clustering to these frames across verbs.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]

This data contains 110 verbs and 33 classes.,4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]

",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"As we did with the multi-class evaluations, we adopt modified purity (mPU), inverse purity (iPU) and their harmonic mean (F1) as the metrics for the evaluation with predominant classes.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"It is not necessary to normalize these metrics when we treat verbs as monosemous, and evaluate against the predominant sense.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]

",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]

clusterings with the NN and IB methods are obtained by using the VALEX subcategorization lexicon.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"To harden the clusterings of the IB method and the LDA-frames, the class with the highest probability is selected for each verb.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
This hardening process is exactly the same as Korhonen et al. (2003).,4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"Note that our results of the NN and IB methods are different from those reported in their paper since the data source is different.8
Table 3 lists accuracies of baseline methods and our methods.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
Our proposed method using the web corpus achieved comparable performance with the baseline methods on the predominant class evaluation and outperformed them on the multiple class evaluation.,4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"More sophisticated methods for predominant class induction, such as the method of Sun and Korhonen (2009) using selectional preferences, could produce better single-class outputs, but have difficulty in producing polysemy-aware verb classes.
",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"From the result, we can see that the induced verb classes based on slot-only features did not achieve a higher F1 than those based on slot-word pair features in many cases.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
This result is different from that of multi-class evaluations in Section 4.3.,4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]
"We speculate that slot distributions are not so different among verbs when all uses of a verb are merged into one frame, and thus their discrimination power is lower than that in the intermediate construction of semantic frames.",4.4 Type-level Single-class Evaluations against Predominant/Multiple Classes,[0],[0]

Imagine an idealised translator whose translations are always perfectly accurate and fluent.,3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"If an MT systemwas providedwith training data from such a translator, it would still encounter variation in that data.",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"After all, there are several perfectly accurate and fluent translations for each source sentence.",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]

"In practice, of course, human translators’ performance varies according to their level of education, their experience on the job, their familiarity with the textual domain and myriads of other factors.",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"Even within a single translator variation may occur due to level of stress, tiredness or status of health.",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"That translation corpora contain variation is acknowledged by the machine translation community in the design of their evaluation metrics which are geared towards comparing onemachinegenerated translation against several human translations (see e.g. Papineni et al., 2002).
",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"Prior to our work, the only attempt at modelling the latent variation underlying these different translations was made by Zhang et al. (2016) who introduced a sentence level Gaussian variable.",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, however, there is more to latent variation than a unimodal density can capture, for example, there may be several highly likely clusters of plausible variations.",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"A cluster may e.g. consist of identical syntactic structures that differ in word choice, another may consist of different syntactic constructs such as active or passive constructions.",3.1 Motivation,[0],[0]
"Multimodal modelling of these variations is thus called for—and our results confirm this intuition.

"Since the model contains latent variables and is parametrised by a neural network, it falls into the class of deep generative models (DGMs).",3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"We use a reparametrisation of the Gaussian variables (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Titsias and Lázaro-Gredilla, 2014) to enable backpropagation inside a stochastic computation graph (Schulman et al., 2015).",3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]

See the supplement for details on the Gaussian reparametrisation.,3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
We use neural networks with one hidden layer with a tanh activation to compute the mean and standard deviation of each Gaussian distribution.,3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
A softplus transformation is applied to the output of the standard deviation’s network to ensure positivity.,3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
Let us denote the functions that these networks compute by f .,3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"For the initial latent state z0 we compute the mean and standard deviation as
µ0 = fµ0 (hm) σ0",3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
= fσ0 (hm) .,3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]

"µi = fµ (ti−1, zi−1) σi",3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"= fσ (ti−1, zi−1) (7)
Using these values, each latent variable is sampled according to Equation (5).",3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
The sampled latent variables are then used to modify the update of the decoder hidden state (Equation (2b)),3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"as follows:
t̃i = RNN (ti−1, yi−1, zi) (8)
The remaining computations stay unchanged.",3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
Notice that the latent values are used directly in updating the decoder state.,3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
This makes the decoder state a function of a random variable and thus the decoder state is itself random.,3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"Applying this argument recursively shows that also the attention mechanism is random, making the decoder entirely stochastic.",3.3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"We use variational inference (see e.g. Blei et al., 2017) to train the model.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"In variational inference, we employ a variational distribution q(z) that approximates the true posterior p(z|x) over the latent variables.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
The distribution q(z) has its own set of parameters λ that is disjoint from the set of model parameters θ.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
It is used to maximise the evidence lower bound (ELBO) which is a lower bound on the marginal likelihood p(x).,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
The ELBO is maximised with respect to both the model parameters θ and the variational parameters λ.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"Most NLP models that use DGMs only use one latent variable (e.g. Bowman et al., 2016).",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"Models
that use several variables usually employ a mean field approximation under which all latent variables are independent.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"This turns the ELBO into a sum of expectations (e.g. Zhou and Neubig, 2017).",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"For our stochastic decoder we design a more flexible approximation posterior family which respects the dependencies between the latent variables,

",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
The first term is often called reconstruction or likelihood term whereas the second term is called the KL term.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"Since the KL term is a function of two Gaussian distributions, and the Gaussian is an exponential family, we can compute it analytically (Michalowicz et al., 2014), without the need for sampling.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
This is very similar to the hierarchical latent variable model of Rezende et al. (2014).,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"Following common practice in DGM research, we employ a neural network to compute the variational distributions.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"To discriminate it from the
generative model, we call this neural net the inference model.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
At training time both the source and target sentence are observed.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
We exploit this by endowing our inference model with a “lookahead” mechanism.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"Concretely, samples from the inference network condition on the information available to the generation network (Section 3.3) and also on the target words that are yet to be processed by the generative decoder.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
This allows the latent distribution to not only encode information about the currently modelled word but also about the target words that follow it.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
The conditioning of the inference network is illustrated graphically in Figure 2b.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
The inference network produces additional representations of the target sentence.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"One representation encodes the target sentence bidirectionally (12a), in analogy to the source sentence encoding.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
The second representation is built by encoding the target sentence in reverse (12b).,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
This reverse encoding can be used to provide information about future context to the decoder.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"We use the symbols b and r for the bidirectional and reverse target encodings, respectively.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, we again use LSTMs to compute these encodings.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]

"As before, we use Equation (5) to sample from the variational distribution.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"During training, all samples are obtained from the inference network.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
Only at test time do we sample from the generator.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
"Notice that since the inference network conditions on representations produced by the generator network, a naïve application of backpropagation would update parts of the generator network with gradients computed for
the inference network.",4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
We prevent this by blocking gradient flow from the inference net into the generator.,4 Inference and Training,[0],[0]
The training procedure as outlined above does not work well empirically.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
This is because our model uses a strong generator.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
By this we mean that the generation model (that is the baseline NMT model) is a very good density model in and by itself and does not need to rely on latent information to achieve acceptable likelihood values during training.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"DGMs with strong generators have a tendency to not make use of latent information (Bowman et al., 2016).",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"This problem went initially unnoticed because early DGMs (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) used weak generators2, i.e. models that made very strong independence assumptions and were not able to capture contextual information without making use of the information encoded by the latent variable.",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
WhyDGMswould ignore the latent information can be understood by considering the KL-term of the ELBO.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]

Since we cannot compute the posterior p(z|y) exactly, we approximate it with the variational distribution q(z|y) (the joint is approximated by q(z|y)p(y) where the latter factor is the data distribution).",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"To the extent that the variational distribution recovers the true posterior, the mutual information can be computed this way.",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"In fact, if we take the learned prior p(z) to be an approximation of themarginal ∫ q(z|y)p(y)dy it can easily be shown that the thus computed KL term is an upper bound on mutual information (Alemi et al., 2017).",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"The trouble is that the ELBO (Equation (11)) can be trivially maximised by setting the KL-term to 0 and maximising only the reconstruction term.
2The term weak generator has first been coined by Alemi et al. (2017).
",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
This is especially likely at the beginning of training when the variational approximation does not yet encode much useful information.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
We can only hope to learn a useful variational distribution if a) the variational approximation is allowed to move away from the prior and b) the resulting increase in the reconstruction term is higher than the increase in the KL-term (i.e. the ELBO increases overall).,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"Several schemes have been proposed to enable better learning of the variational distribution (Bowman et al., 2016; Kingma et al., 2016; Alemi et al., 2017).",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
Here we use KL scaling and increase the scale gradually until the original objective is recovered.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"This has the following effect: during the initial learning stage, the KL-term barely contributes to the objective and thus the updates to the variational parameters are driven by the signal from the reconstruction term and hardly restricted by the prior.",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
Once the scale factor approaches 1 the variational distribution will be highly informative to the generator (assuming sufficiently slow increase of the scale factor).,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
The KL-term can now be minimised by matching the prior to the variational distribution.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"Notice that up to this point, the prior has hardly been updated.",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
Thus moving the variational approximation back to the prior would likely reduce the reconstruction term since the standard normal prior is not useful for inference purposes.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
This is in stark contrast to Bowman et al. (2016) whose prior was a fixed standard normal distribution.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
"Although they used KL scaling, the KL term could only be decreased by moving the variational approximation back to the fixed prior.",4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
This problem disappears in our model where priors are learned.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
Moving the prior towards the variational approximation has another desirable effect.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
The prior can now learn to emulate the variational “lookahead” mechanism without having access to future contexts itself (recall that the inference model has access to future target tokens).,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
At test time we can thus hope to have learned latent variable distributions that encode information not only about the output at the current position but about future outputs as well.,4.1 Analysis of the Training Procedure,[0],[0]
We report experiments on the IWSLT 2016 data set which contains transcriptions of TED talks and their respective translations.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We trained models to
translate from English into Arabic, Czech, French and German.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The number of sentences for each language after preprocessing is shown in Table 1.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The vocabulary was split into 50,000 subword units using Google’s sentence piece3 software in its standard settings.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"As our baseline NMT systems we use Sockeye (Hieber et al., 2017)4.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Sockeye implements several different NMT models but here we use the standard recurrent attentional model described in Section 2.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We report baselines with and without dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
For dropout a retention probability of 0.5 was used.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
As a second baseline we use our own implementation of the model of Zhang et al. (2016) which contains a single sentence-level Gaussian latent variable (SENT).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Our implementation differs from theirs in three aspects.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"First, we feed the last hidden state of the bidirectional encoding into encoding of the source and target sentence into the inference network (Zhang et al. (2016) use the average of all states).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Second, the latent variable is smaller in size than the one used by (Zhang et al., 2016).5",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
This was done to make their model and the stochastic decoder proposed here as similar as possible.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, their implementation was based on groundhog whereas ours builds on Sockeye.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Our stochastic decoder model (SDEC) is also built on top of the basic Sockeyemodel.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
It adds the components described in Sections 3 and 4.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Recall that the functions that compute the means and standard deviations are implemented by neural nets with a single hidden layer with tanh activation.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The width of that layer is twice the size of the latent variable.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
In our experiments we tested different latent variable sizes and used KL scaling (see Section 4.1).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The scale started from 0 and was increased by 1/20,000 after each mini-batch.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Thus, at iteration t the scale is min(t/20,000, 1).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"All models use 1028 units for the LSTM hid3https://github.com/google/sentencepiece 4https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye 5We did, however, find that increasing the latent variable size actually hurt performance in our implementation.

den state (or 512 for each direction in the bidirectional LSTMs) and 256 for the attention mechansim.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Training is done with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
In decoding we use a beam of size 5 and output the most likely word at each position.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We deterministically set all latent variables to their mean values during decoding.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Monte Carlo decoding (Gal, 2016) is difficult to apply to our setting as it would require sampling entire translations.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Results We show the BLEU scores for all models that we tested on the IWSLT data set in Table 2.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The stochastic decoder dominates the Sockeye baseline across all 4 languages, and outperforms SENT on most languages.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Except on German, there is a trend towards smaller latent variable sizes being more helpful.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
This is in line with findings by Chung et al. (2015) and Fraccaro et al. (2016) who also used relatively small latent variables.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
This observation also implies that our model does not improve simply because it has more parameters than the baseline.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
That the margin between the SDEC and SENT models is not large was to be expected for two reasons.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"First, Chung et al. (2015) and Fraccaro et al. (2016) have shown that stochastic RNNs lead to enormous improvements in modelling continuous sequences but only modest increases in performance for discrete sequences (such as natural language).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Second, translation performance is measured in BLEU score.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We observed that SDEC often reached better ELBO values than SENT indicating a better model fit.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"How to fully leverage the better modelling ability of stochastic RNNs when producing discrete outputs is a matter of future research.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Qualitative Analysis Finally, we would like to demonstrate that our model does indeed capture variation in translation.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To this end, we randomly picked sentences from the IWSLT test set and had our model translate them several times, however, the values of the latent variables were sampled instead of fixed.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Contrary to the BLEU-based evaluation, beam search was not used in this evaluation in order to avoid interaction between different latent variable samples.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
See Figure 3 for examples of syntactic and lexical variation.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
It is important to note that we do not sample from the categorical output distribution.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
For each target position we pick the most likely word.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"A non-stochastic NMT system would always yield the same translation in
this scenario.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, when we applied the sampling procedure to the SENT model it did not produce any variation at all, thus behaving like a deterministic NMT system.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This supports our initial point that the SENT model is likely insensitive to local variation, a problem that our model was designed to address.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Like the model of Bowman et al. (2016), SENT presumably tends to ignore the latent variable.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The stochastic decoder is strongly influenced by previous work on stochastic RNNs.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
The first such proposal was made by Bayer and Osendorfer (2015) who introduced i.i.d.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Gaussian latent variables at each output position.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Since their model neglects any sequential dependence of the noise sources, it underperformed on several sequence modeling tasks.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Chung et al. (2015) made the latent variables depend on previous information by feeding the previous decoder state into the latent variable sampler.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Their inference model did not make use of future elements in the sequence.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Using a “look-ahead” mechanism in the inference net was proposed by Fraccaro et al. (2016) who had a separate stochastic and deterministic RNN layer which both influence the output.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Since the stochastic layer in their model depends on the deterministic layer but not vice versa, they could first run the deterministic layer at inference time and then condition the inference net’s encoding of the future on the thus obtained features.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Like us, they used KL scaling during training.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More recently, Goyal et al. (2017) proposed an auxiliary loss that has the inference net predict future feature representations.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
This approach yields state-of-the-art results but is still in need of a theoretical justification.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Within translation, Zhang et al. (2016) were the first to incorporate Gaussian variables into an NMT model.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Their approach only uses one sentence-level latent variable (corresponding to our z0) and can thus not deal with word-level variation directly.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Concurrently to our work, Su et al. (2018) have also proposed a recurrent latent variable model for NMT.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Their approach differs from ours in that they do not use a 0th latent variable nor a look-ahead mechanism during inference time.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, their underlying recurrent model is a GRU.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In the wider field of NLP, deep generative mod-
els have been applied mostly in monolingual settings such as text generation (Bowman et al., 2016; Semeniuta et al., 2017), morphological analysis (Zhou and Neubig, 2017), dialogue modelling (Wen et al., 2017), question selection (Miao et al., 2016) and summarisation (Miao and Blunsom, 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]

"Understanding temporal information described in natural language text is a key component of natural language understanding (Mani et al., 2006; Verhagen et al., 2007; Chambers et al., 2007; Bethard and Martin, 2007) and, following a series of TempEval (TE) workshops (Verhagen et al., 2007, 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), it has drawn increased attention.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Time-slot filling (Surdeanu, 2013; Ji et al., 2014), storyline construction (Do et al., 2012; Minard et al., 2015), clinical narratives processing (Jindal and Roth, 2013; Bethard et al., 2016), and temporal question answering (Llorens et al., 2015) are all explicit examples of temporal processing.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The fundamental tasks in temporal processing, as identified in the TE workshops, are 1) time expression (the so-called “timex”) extraction
and normalization and 2) temporal relation (also known as TLINKs (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a)) extraction.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the first task has now been well handled by the state-of-the-art systems (HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2010), SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012), IllinoisTime (Zhao et al., 2012), NavyTime (Chambers, 2013), UWTime (Lee et al., 2014), etc.) with end-to-end F1 scores being around 80%, the second task has long been a challenging one; even the top systems only achieved F1 scores of around 35% in the TE workshops.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The goal of the temporal relation task is to generate a directed temporal graph whose nodes represent temporal entities (i.e., events or timexes) and edges represent the TLINKs between them.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The task is challenging because it often requires global considerations – considering the entire graph, the TLINK annotation is quadratic in the number of nodes and thus very expensive, and an overwhelming fraction of the temporal relations are missing in human annotation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose a structured learning approach to temporal relation extraction, where local models are updated based on feedback from global inferences.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The structured approach also gives rise to a semisupervised method, making it possible to take advantage of the readily available unlabeled data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a byproduct, this approach further provides a new, effective perspective on handling those missing relations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the common formulations, temporal relations are categorized into three types: the E-E TLINKs (those between a pair of events), the T-T TLINKs (those between a pair of timexes), and the E-T TLINKs (those between an event and a timex).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the proposed approach can be generally applied to all three types, this paper focuses on the majority type, i.e., the E-E TLINKs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As discussed in existing work (Verhagen, 2004; Bramsen et al., 2006; Mani et al., 2006; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008), the structure of a temporal graph is constrained by some rather simple rules:
1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Symmetry.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, if A is before B, then B must be after A.
2.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Transitivity.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, if A is before B and B is before C, then A must be before C.
This particular structure of a temporal graph (especially the transitivity structure) makes its nodes highly interrelated, as can be seen from Fig. 1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It is thus very challenging to identify the TLINKs between them, even for human annotators: The inter-annotator agreement on TLINKs is usually about 50%-60% (Mani et al., 2006).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Fig. 2 shows the actual human annotations provided by TE3.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Among all the ten possible pairs of nodes, only three TLINKs were annotated.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Even if we only look at main events in consecutive sentences and at events in the same sentence, there are still quite a few missing TLINKs, e.g., the one between hurt and cascaded and the one between monitor and ordered.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Early attempts by Mani et al. (2006); Chambers et al. (2007); Bethard et al. (2007); Verhagen and Pustejovsky (2008) studied local methods – learning models that make pairwise decisions between each pair of events.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"State-of-the-art local methods, including ClearTK (Bethard, 2013), UTTime
(Laokulrat et al., 2013), and NavyTime (Chambers, 2013), use better designed rules or more features such as syntactic tree paths and achieve better results.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the decisions made by these (local) models are often globally inconsistent (i.e., the symmetry and/or transitivity constraints are not satisfied for the entire temporal graph).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Integer linear programming (ILP) methods (Roth and Yih, 2004) were used in this domain to enforce global consistency by several authors including Bramsen et al. (2006); Chambers and Jurafsky (2008); Do et al. (2012), which formulated TLINK extraction as an ILP and showed that it improves over local methods for densely connected graphs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since these methods perform inference (“I”) on top of pre-trained local classifiers (“L”), they are often referred to as L+I (Punyakanok et al., 2005).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In a state-of-the-art method, CAEVO (Chambers et al., 2014), many hand-crafted rules and machine learned classifiers (called sieves therein) form a pipeline.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The global consistency is enforced by inferring all possible relations before passing the graph to the next sieve.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This best-first architecture is conceptually similar to L+I but the inference is greedy, similar to Mani et al. (2007); Verhagen and Pustejovsky (2008).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although L+I methods impose global constraints in the inference phase, this paper argues that global considerations are necessary in the learning phase as well (i.e., structured learning).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In parallel to the work presented here, Leeuwenberg and Moens (2017) also proposed a structured learning approach to extracting the temporal relations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Their work focuses on a domain-specific dataset from Clinical TempEval (Bethard et al., 2016), so their work does not need to address some of the difficulties of the general problem that our work addresses.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More importantly, they compared structured learning to local baselines, while we find that the comparison between structured learning and L+I is more interesting and important for
understanding the effect of global considerations in the learning phase.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In difference from existing methods, we also discuss how to effectively use unlabeled data and how to handle the overwhelming fraction of missing relations in a principled way.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our solution targets on these issues and, as we show, achieves significant improvements on two commonly used evaluation sets.

"Existing corpora for temporal processing often follows the interval representation of events proposed in Allen (1984), and makes use of 13 relation types in total.",2.1 Temporal Relation Types,[0],[0]
"In many systems, vague or none is also included as another relation type when a TLINK is not clear or missing.",2.1 Temporal Relation Types,[0],[0]
"However, current systems usually use a reduced set of relation types, mainly due to the following reasons.
1.",2.1 Temporal Relation Types,[0],[0]
The non-uniform distribution of all the relation types makes it difficult to separate lowfrequency ones from the others (see Table 1 in Mani et al. (2006)).,2.1 Temporal Relation Types,[0],[0]

more than one sentence away are deleted for computational efficiency and (usually) for better performance.",3.1 Inference,[0],[0]

"However, fr(ij) is usually more reliable when i and j are closer in text.",3.1 Inference,[0],[0]

"While some of these missing TLINKs can be inferred from existing ones, the vast majority still remain unknown as shown in Table 1.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"De-
spite the existence of denser annotation schemes (e.g., Cassidy et al. (2014)), the TLINK annotation task is quadratic in the number of nodes, and it is practically infeasible to annotate complete graphs.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the problem of identifying these unknown relations in training and test is a major issue that dramatically hurts existing methods.
",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
We could simply use these unknown pairs (or some filtered version of them) to design rules or train classifiers to identify whether a TLINK is vague or not.,4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"However, we propose to exclude both the unknown pairs and the vague classifier from the training process – by changing the structured loss function to ignore the inference feedback on vague TLINKs (see Line 9 in Algorithm 1 and Line 9 in Algorithm 2).",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"The reasons are discussed below.
",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"First, it is believed that a lot of the unknown pairs are not really vague but rather pairs that the annotators failed to look at (Bethard et al., 2007; Cassidy et al., 2014; Chambers et al., 2014).",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"For example, (cascaded, monitor) should be annotated as before but is missing in Fig. 2.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
It is hard to exclude this noise in the data during training.,4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"Second, compared to the overwhelmingly large number of unknown TLINKs (89.5% as shown in Table 1), the scarcity of non-vague TLINKs makes it hard to learn a good vague classifier.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"Third, vague is fundamentally different from the other relation types.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"For example, if a before TLINK can be established given a sentence, then it always holds as before regardless of other events around it, but if a TLINK is vague given a sentence, it may still change to other types afterwards if a connection can later be established through other nodes from the context.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"This distinction emphasizes that vague is a consequence of lack of background/contextual information, rather than a concrete relation type to be trained on.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"Fourth, without the vague classifier, the predicted temporal graph tends to become more densely connected, thus the global transitivity constraints can be more effective in correcting local mistakes (Chambers
and Jurafsky, 2008).",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"However, excluding the local classifier for vague TLINKs would undesirably assign nonvague TLINKs to every pair of events.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"To handle this, we take a closer look at the vague TLINKs.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
We note that a vague TLINK could arise in two situations if the annotators did not fail to look at it.,4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"One is that an annotator looks at this pair of events and decides that multiple relations can exist, and the other one is that two annotators disagree on the relation (similar arguments were also made in Cassidy et al. (2014)).",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"In both situations, the annotators first try to assign all possible relations to a TLINK, and then change the relation to vague if more than one can be assigned.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"This human annotation process for vague is different from many existing methods, which either identify the existence of a TLINK first (using rules or machinelearned classifiers) and then classify, or directly include vague as a classification label along with other non-vague relations.
",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"In this work, however, we propose to mimic this mental process by a post-filtering method2.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we take each TLINK produced by ILP and determine whether it is vague using its relative entropy (the Kullback-Leibler divergence) to the uniform distribution.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"Let {rm}Mm=1 be the set of relations that the i-th pair of events can take, we filter the i-th TLINK given by ILP by:
δi = M∑ m=1 frm(φi) log (Mfrm(φi)),
where frm(φi) is the soft-max score of rm, obtained by the local classifier for rm.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"We then compare δi to a fixed threshold τ to determine the vagueness of this TLINK; we accept its originally predicted label if δi > τ , or change it to vague otherwise.",4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
Using relative entropy here is intuitively appealing and empirically useful as shown in the experiments section; better metrics are of course yet to be designed.,4 Missing Annotations,[0],[0]
"The TempEval3 (TE3) workshop (UzZaman et al., 2013) provided the TimeBank (TB) (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b), AQUAINT (AQ) (Graff, 2002), Silver (TE3-SV), and Platinum (TE3-PT) datasets,

Two popular augmentations on TB are the VerbClause temporal relation dataset (VC) and TimebankDense dataset (TD).,5.1 Datasets,[0],[0]

UTTime (“AP-2” in Table 3).",5.3.1 TE3 Task C - Relation Only,[0],[0]

"From lines 2-4, all systems see significant drops in performance if compared with the same entries in Table 3.",5.3.2 TE3 Task C,[0],[0]
It confirms our assertion that how to handle vague TLINKs is a major issue for this temporal relation extraction problem.,5.3.2 TE3 Task C,[0],[0]
"The improvement of SP+ILP (line 4) over AP (line 2) was small and AP+ILP (line 3) was even worse than AP, which necessitates the use of a better approach
towards vague TLINKs.",5.3.2 TE3 Task C,[0],[0]

"In this case, the improvement of S+I over Local was small, which may be due to the lack of training data.",5.3.2 TE3 Task C,[0],[0]

were used here, which explains the difference between line 11 in Table 4 and what was reported in Chambers et al. (2014).
ClearTK was reported to be outperformed by CAEVO on TD-Test (Chambers et al., 2014), but we observe that ClearTK on line 10 was much worse even than itself on line 7 (trained on TB+VC) and on line 1 (trained on TB+AQ+VC+TD) due to the annotation scheme difference between TD and TB/AQ/VC. ClearTK was designed mainly for TE3, aiming for high precision, which is reflected by its high precision on line 10, but it does not have enough flexibility to cope with two very different annotation schemes.",5.3.3 Comparison with CAEVO,[0],[0]

",5.3.3 Comparison with CAEVO,[0],[0]

Abstract
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) annotations are often assumed to closely mirror dependency syntax, but AMR explicitly does not require this, and the assumption has never been tested. To test it, we devise an expressive framework to align AMR graphs to dependency graphs, which we use to annotate 200 AMRs. Our annotation explains how 97% of AMR edges are evoked by words or syntax. Previously existing AMR alignment frameworks did not allow for mapping AMR onto syntax, and as a consequence they explained at most 23%. While we find that there are indeed many cases where AMR annotations closely mirror syntax, there are also pervasive differences. We use our annotations to test a baseline AMR-to-syntax aligner, finding that this task is more difficult than AMRto-string alignment; and to pinpoint errors in an AMR parser. We make our data and code freely available for further research on AMR parsing and generation, and the relationship of AMR to syntax.",text,[0],[0]
"Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR; Banarescu et al., 2013) is a popular framework for annotating whole sentence meaning.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An AMR annotation is a directed, usually acyclic graph in which nodes represent entities and events, and edges represent relations between them, as on the right in figure 1.1
AMR annotations include no explicit mapping between elements of an AMR and the corresponding elements of the sentence that evoke them, and this presents a challenge to developers of machine learning systems that parse sentences to AMR or generate sentences from AMR, since they must
1For clarity of presentation, we have constructed the sentences and AMRs shown in figures—except for figure 3, which is a simplified version of a sentence in the corpus.
first infer this mapping in the training data (e.g. Flanigan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015; Flanigan et al., 2016; Pourdamghani et al., 2016; Misra and Artzi, 2016; Damonte et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2017, inter alia).2
This AMR alignment problem was first formalized by Flanigan et al. (2014), who mapped AMR nodes or connected subgraphs to words or sequences of words under the assumption of a oneto-one mapping—we call this JAMR alignment.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Pourdamghani et al. (2014) then re-formalized it so that any AMR node or edge can map to any word without a one-to-one assumption—we call this ISI alignment.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In ISI alignments, edges often align to syntactic function words: for example, :location aligns to in in figure 1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"So edge alignments allow ISI to explain more of the AMR structure than JAMR, but in a limited way: only 23% of AMR edges are aligned in the ISI corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This may be be-
2Some recent neural AMR sytems require minimal or no explicit alignments (Konstas et al., 2017; van Noord and Bos, 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But they implicitly learn them in the form of soft attention, and we believe that a clearer understanding of alignment will benefit modeling and error analysis even in these systems.

cause edges are often evoked by syntactic structure rather than words: for instance, the :ARG1 edge in figure 1 is evoked by the fact that cat is the subject of lies and not by any particular word.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although it seems sensible to assume that all of the nodes and edges of an AMR are evoked by the words and syntax of a sentence, the existing alignment schemes do not allow for expressing that relationship.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We therefore propose a framework expressive enough to align AMR to syntax (§2) and use it to align a corpus of 200 AMRs to dependency parses.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We analyse our corpus and show that the addition of syntactic alignments allows us account for 97% of the AMR content.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Syntactic-semantic mappings are often assumed by AMR parsing models (e.g. Wang et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015; Damonte et al., 2017), which is understandable since these mappings are wellstudied in linguistic theory.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
But AMR explicitly avoids theoretical commitment to a syntaxsemantics mapping: Banarescu et al. (2013) state that “AMR is agnostic about how we might want to derive meanings from strings.”,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"If we are going to build such an assumption into our models, we should test it empirically, which we can do by analysing our corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We observe some pervasive structural differences between AMR and dependency syntax (§3), despite the fact that a majority of AMR edges map easily onto dependency edges.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since syntactic alignment can largely explain AMRs, we also develop a baseline rule-based aligner for it, and show that this new task is much more difficult than lexical alignment (§4).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We also show how our data can be used to analyze errors made by an AMR parser (§5).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We make our annotated data and aligner freely available for further research.3,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our syntactic representation is dependency grammar, which represents the sentence as a rooted, directed graph where nodes are words and edges are grammatical relations between them (Kruijff, 2006).",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"We use Universal Dependencies (UD), a cross-lingual dependency annotation scheme, as implemented in Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014).",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"Within the UD framework, we use enhanced dependencies (Schuster and Manning, 2016), in which dependents can have more than one head,
3https://github.com/ida-szubert/amr_ud
resulting in dependency graphs (DGs).4
Our alignment guidelines generalize ideas present in the existing frameworks.",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"We want to allow many-to-many alignments, which we motivate by the observation that some phenomena cause an AMR graph to have one structure expressing the same information as multiple DG structures, and vice versa.",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"For instance, in figure 2 the AMR subgraph representing Cruella de Vil aligns to two subgraphs in the dependency graph because of pronominal coreference.",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"In the other direction, in figure 3 the capabilities node aligns to both capable nodes in the AMR, which is a result of the AMR treating conjoined adjectival modifiers as a case of ellipsis.",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
The alignments we propose hold between subgraphs of any size.,2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
By aligning subgraphs we gain expressiveness needed to point out correspondences between semantic and syntactic structure.,2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"If AMR and DG were very similar in how they represent information, such correspondences would probably hold between subgraphs consisting of a single edge, as in figure 1 cat nmod:possÐÐÐÐÐ→my ∼ cat possÐÐ→I.",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"However, AMR by design abstracts away from syntax and it should not be assumed that all mappings will be so clean.",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"For example, the same figure has lies nmod-inÐÐÐÐ→sun caseÐÐ→in∼ lies locationÐÐÐÐ→sun.",2 Aligning AMR to dependency syntax,[0],[0]
"Moreover, AMR represents the meaning of particular words or phrases with elaborate structures, the result of which might be that the same information is expressed by a single word and a complex AMR subgraph, as in figure 3 where AMR represents general as person

An alignment is a link between subgraphs in an AMR and a DG which represent equivalent information.,2.1 Overview,[0],[0]
Given a sentence’s DG and AMR we define an alignment as a mapping between an AMR subgraph and a DG subgraph.,2.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Lexical alignments (§2.2) hold between pairs of nodes, and nodes from either graph may participate in multiple lexical alignments.",2.1 Overview,[0],[0]

"4We chose UD because it emphasises shallow and semantically motivated annotation, by the virtue of which it can be expected to align relatively straightforwardly to a semantic annotation such as AMR.",2.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Aligning AMR with different versions of dependency grammar (e.g. Prague) or different syntactic frameworks (e.g. CCG, TAG) would be an interesting extension of our work.

In the following two sections we discuss the types of alignments that our framework allows.,2.1 Overview,[0],[0]
More detailed guidelines regarding how to align particular linguistic constructions can be found in appendix A.,2.1 Overview,[0],[0]
A lexical alignment should hold between a word and an AMR concept if the latter is judged to express the lexical meaning of the former.,2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"Node labels usually reflect their lexically aligned word or its lemma, including derivational morphology (e.g. thirsty ∼ thirst-01).",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"Thus, string similarity is a useful heuristic for lexical alignment.5
Most AMR nodes align lexically to a single word.",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"Cases of one-to-many alignments include coreference, when an entity is mentioned multiple times in the sentence, and multiword expressions such as a verb-particle constructions (pay off ∼ pay-off-02) and fixed grammatical expressions (instead of ∼ instead-of-91).",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
Occasionally an AMR node does not lexically align to any DG node.,2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"This is true for constants indicating sentence mood such as imperative, implicit uses of and to group list items, inferred concept nodes such as entity
5Exceptions include: pronouns with noun antecedents in the sentence; the - indicating negative polarity, which lexically aligns to no, not, and negative prefixes; modal auxiliaries, e.g., can ∼ possible; normalized dates and values such as February ∼ 2 in a date-entity; and amr-unknown, which aligns to wh-words.
",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"types, name in named entities, and -91 frames like have-org-role-91.
",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"Most words are lexically aligned to a single AMR node, if they are aligned at all.",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"A word may align to multiple AMR nodes if it is duplicated in the AMR due to ellipsis or distributive coordination (capabilities aligns to c2 / capable and c3 / capable in figure 3), or if it is morphologically decomposed in the AMR (evildoer aligns to evil and do-02 in figure 2).",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"Many words are not lexically aligned to any AMR node, including punctuation tokens, articles, copulas, nonmodal auxiliaries, expletive subjects, infinitival to, complementizer that, and relative pronouns.",2.2 Lexical alignments,[0],[0]
"Structural alignments primarily reflect compositional grammatical constructions, be they syntactic or morphological.",2.3 Structural alignments,[0],[0]
Note that the structural alignments build upon the lexical ones.,2.3 Structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Structural alignments hold between two subgraphs, at least one of which is larger than a single node.",2.3 Structural alignments,[0],[0]
"If a subgraph includes any edges, it automatically includes nodes adjacent to those edges.",2.3 Structural alignments,[0],[0]
Structural alignments need not be disjoint: an edge can appear in two or more distinct alignments.,2.3 Structural alignments,[0],[0]
Nodes and edges in both AMR and DG may be unaligned.,2.3 Structural alignments,[0],[0]
"The ability to align subgraphs to subgraphs gives considerable flexibility in how the annotation task
can be interpreted.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
We establish the following principles to guide the specification of alignment: Connectedness Principle.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"In an alignment d ∼ a, d must be a connected subgraph of the DG, and a must be a connected subgraph of the AMR.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
Minimality Principle.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"If two alignments, d ∼ a and d′ ∼ a′, have no dependency or AMR edges in common, then their union d ∪d′ ∼",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"a∪a′ is redundant, even if it is valid.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
Individual alignments should be as small as possible; we believe compositionality is best captured by keeping structures minimal.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Therefore, in figure 1 there is no alignment between subgraphs spanning My, cat, lies and i, cat, lie.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Such subgraphs do express equivalent information, but the alignment between them decomposes neatly into smaller alignments and we record only those.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
Subsumption Principle.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
This principle expresses the fact that our alignments are hierarchical.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Structural alignments need to be consistent with lexical alignments: for subgraph a to be aligned to subgraph d, all nodes lexically aligned to nodes in a must be included in d, and vice versa.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Moreover, structural alignments need to be consistent with other structural alignments.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"A structural alignment d ∼ a is valid only if, for every connected AMR subgraph a< ⊂ a which is aligned to a DG subgraph, d′ ∼ a<, we also have that d′ is a subgraph of d—and vice versa for every d< ⊂",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"d.
Further, if a contains a node n which is not lexically aligned but which is part of a structurally aligned subgraph a′ such that d′ ∼ a′, it needs to be the case that a′ ⊂ a ∧ d′ ⊂ d or

"For example, conceal

",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
Coordination Principle.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"If an alignment contains a dependency edge between two conjuncts, or between a conjunct and a coordinating conjunction, then it must also include all conjuncts and the conjunction.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
This preserves the integrity of coordinate structures in alignments.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"For example, in figure 2 there is no alignment glee ccÐ→and ∼ and op1Ð→glee; only the larger structure which includes the greed nodes is aligned.
",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
Named Entity Principle.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
Any structural alignment containing an AMR name node or any of the strings under it must contain the full subgraph rooted in the name plus the node above it specifying the entity type.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"This means that for example, in figure 2 there is no alignment conceal nsubj-xsubjÐÐÐÐÐ→Cruella ∼ conceal ARG0ÐÐ→person nameÐÐ→name op1Ð→""Cruella"".",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
Such an alignment would also be stopped by the Subsumption Principle provided that the blue alignment of the whole name was present.,2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"The Named Entity Principle is superfluous, but is provided to explicitly describe the treatment of such constructions.",2.3.1 Constraints on structural alignments,[0],[0]
"The smallest structure which can participate in a structural alignment is a single node, provided that it is aligned to a subgraph containing at least one edge.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"A DG node may align to an AMR subgraph if the word is morphologically decomposed or otherwise analyzed in the AMR (e.g. in figure 2, evildoer ∼ person ARG0-ofÐÐÐÐ→do-02 ARG1ÐÐ→thing modÐ→evil).",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Examples of DG structures whose meaning is expressed in a single AMR node include light verb constructions, phrasal verbs, and various other multiword expressions (e.g. in figure 2, makes dobjÐÐ→attempt ∼ attempt-01).
",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Conceptually the simplest case of structural alignment is one edge to one edge, as in the blue and green alignments in figure 1.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"For such an alignment to be possible, two requirements must be satisfied: nodes which are endpoints of those edges need to be aligned one-to-one; and the AMR relation and the syntactic dependency must map cleanly in terms of the relationship they express.
",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
A one edge to multiple edges alignment arises when either of those requirements is not met.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
To see what happens in absence of one-to-one endpoint alignments let’s look at the relation between confident and general in figure 3.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
The DG general node is aligned to an AMR subgraph: general∼ person ARG0-ofÐÐÐÐ→have-org-role ARG2ÐÐ→general.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
All alignments which involve the general node on the DG side need to include its aligned subgraph on the AMR side.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"It necessarily follows that the AMR subgraphs in those alignments will contain more edges that the DG ones; in this case the yellow subgraph in DG has 1 edge, and in AMR 3 edges.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"As for the second requirement, it is possible for one graph to use multiple edges to express a relationship when the other graph needs only one.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
This is the case for lie nmod-inÐÐÐÐ→sun caseÐÐ→in ∼ lie locationÐÐÐÐ→sun in figure 1.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"An example which combines both the node- and edge-related issues is marked in red in figure 2.
",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Finally, we also allow for many edges to many edges alignments.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"This may seem counterintuitive considering the assumption that we want to capture mappings between relations expressed in DG and AMR, and that we want to align minimal subgraphs.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"There are cases where an alignment is actually capturing a single relation, but we need to treat a subgraph as an endpoint of the edge both in DG and AMR.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"For instance, con-
sider in figure 2 the relationship that holds between Cruella de Vil and concealing, expressed syntactically as an nsubj-xsubj edge and semantically as an ARG0 edge.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"One of the entities involved in that relationship, Cruella, is represented by a 2- edge DG subgraph and a 4-edge AMR subgraph.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"Consequently, the alignment covering the DG and AMR edges that relate Cruella to concealing must link subgraphs consisting respectively of 3 and 5 edges.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
A more difficult case of many edges to many edges alignment arises when relationships between nodes are expressed so differently in the DG and AMR that given an edge in one graph it is not possible to find in the other graph a subgraph that would convey the same information without also including some other information.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
Coordination has this property: e.g. in figure 2 the conj-and dependency between glee and greed has no counterpart in the AMR.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
"There is no edge between AMR nodes aligned to those words, and the smallest AMR subgraph which contains them also contains and, which is itself lexically aligned.",2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
We cannot align glee conj-andÐÐÐÐ→greed ∼ glee op1←Ðand,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
op2Ð→greed because of the rule that all lexically aligned nodes in one subgraph must be aligned to nodes in the other subgraph.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]
Therefore we need to extend the DG side to and cc←Ðglee conj-andÐÐÐÐ→greed.,2.3.2 Typology of structural alignments,[0],[0]

A.1 Lexical alignments Names.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"In proper names, individual strings denoting words in the name are lexically aligned, but the entity as a whole is structurally aligned.
",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Entity types.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"If the entity type is based on a common noun which occurs in the sentence, it is lexically aligned: e.g., Jon, a clumsy man, has a cat would involve the alignment man ∼ man.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Most often, however, an entity type is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence and is taken from AMR’s ontology of entity types (http://www.isi.edu/ ~ulf/amr/lib/ne-types.html), in which case it will not be lexically aligned.
",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Case marking and prepositions.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
The possessive marker ’s and many prepositions participate in structural but not lexical alignments because they are inherently relational.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"However, we align a preposition if it carries sufficient lexical content to be included as an AMR node (e.g., the AMR for The cat is under the table would include under
op1Ð→table).",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Wh-questions.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
The special concept amr-unknown aligns lexically to the wh-word whose referent is questioned.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"For multiword wh-expressions like how much, the expression is aligned structurally (not lexically) to amr-unknown.
Sentence mood.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"In AMR, non-wh questions are indicated by
modeÐÐ→interrogative, imperatives by modeÐÐ→imperative, and exclamations/interjections by
modeÐÐ→expressive.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"UD parses do not encode sentence mood, which can be conveyed by noncanonical word order (subject-auxiliary inversion for questions) or argument omission (subject omission for imperatives), rather than the presence of certain relations or words.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Sometimes the sentence includes an appropriate alignment point, e.g. complementizers whether and if for interrogative, allowing for a lexical alignment.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"More often the parse has no obvious alignment point, and the constant interrogative, imperative, or expressive is left unaligned.21
A.2 Structural alignments
Copulas.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"In UD, copulas are treated as modifiers of a predicate nominal or adjective, which is linked directly to the subject of the sentence via an nsubj dependency.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
We do not align copulas or the cop edge.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Thus, in figure 3, there is a structural alignment between general nsubj←ÐÐconfident and the AMR subgraph connecting the lexically aligned nodes.
",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"21Among the UD community there has been discussion of possibly adding sentence-level marking of mood (https:// github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/458), which could provide a convenient alignment point.
",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Control.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"The subject of the control verb and the controlled predicate are connected by the nsubjxsubj edge, which can be structurally aligned with the corresponding AMR argument relation, as in e.g. figure 2.
",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Relative clauses.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"In enhanced UD the noun governing a relative clause and the embedded predicate are linked by edges in both directions: a “surface syntax” acl-relcl edge headed by the noun, and a “deep syntax” edge such as nsubj, dobj, iobj, or nmod headed by the embedded predicate.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Each participates in a structural alignment with the corresponding AMR subgraph.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"The relative pronoun is left unaligned.
Coordination.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Coordination does not naturally lend itself to analysis with dependencies, and different dependency grammar traditions offer different approaches (Nivre, 2005; Mareček et al., 2013).",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"UD follows the Stanford style, where the first conjunct serves as the head of the remaining conjuncts, and the conjunction is a dependent of one of the conjuncts.22 In AMR the conjunction heads all the conjuncts (Prague style).",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"In light of this mismatch, we use a subgraph alignment to group the conjunction with its conjuncts on each side.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
A simple example is illustrated in figure 2.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
A quirk of UD’s approach to coordination is that it does not distinguish modifiers of the first conjunct from modifiers of the coordinate structure as a whole.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
The basic UD parse of her glee and greed is therefore ambiguous.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"We rely on an extra edge in the enhanced parse between her and greed to establish an alignment for the AMR edge greed
ARG0ÐÐ→person.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"The coordination in figure 3 is more complex: the coordinated modifier defense and security distributes over capabilities (i.e., there are two kinds of capabilities).",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"In the enhanced parse, defense and security are both attached as modifiers of capabilities.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"This is expressed semantically via duplicate AMR nodes labeled capable, each receiving different modifiers corresponding to different conjuncts.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Independent of coordination, the two capable nodes also share a common argument, nation.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"The three syntactic modifiers give rise to three subgraph alignments, and the subgraph alignment covering the coordinate structure (cyan in the figure) envelops two of these.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Ellipsis construc-
22In UD version 1, and therefore the examples in this paper, the conjunction attaches to the first conjunct, whereas in version 2 it attaches to the next successive conjunct (http: //universaldependencies.org/v2/summary.html).
",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"tions can also trigger node duplication in AMR, requiring similar structural alignments.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Named entities.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"AMR annotates each named entity with a node representing the name, linked to the strings of the name and headed by an entity type.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
This full structure is aligned to the full name in the dependency parse.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Coreferent mentions.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Coreference often causes an AMR structure to align to multiple DG subgraphs.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"For example, in figure 2, both the pronoun her and the name align to the AMR subgraph representing the entity.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
This mechanism suffices to represent coreference between mentions in the sentence.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Light verbs.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Light verbs have no lexical alignment, but a subgraph alignment covers the light verb construction as a unit (e.g. makes dobjÐÐ→attempt∼ attempt-01 in figure 2).",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"All subgraph alignments which involve the light verb or its complement have to involve to whole unit, as shown in the alignment highlighted in red in figure 2.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Multiword expressions.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"In verb-particle constructions and fixed grammatical expressions the AMR node lexically aligns to all words in the expression, and additionally to the DG subgraph spanning the whole expression.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"(e.g. pay ∼ pay-off-02, off ∼ pay-off-02, and pay compound-prtÐÐÐÐÐÐÐ→off ∼ pay-off-02).",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
Prepositional phrases.,A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"PP modifiers typically involve an extra dependency edge for the preposition attachment, as with lies nmod-inÐÐÐÐ→sun caseÐÐ→in ∼ lie-07 locationÐÐÐÐ→sun.
Semantically decomposed words.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"When one word has multiple lexical alignments because of morphological decomposition, there also exists a structural alignment between that word and an AMR subgraph representing the decomposition: e.g., in figure 2, evildoer∼ person ARG0-ofÐÐÐÐ→do-02 ARG1ÐÐ→thing modÐ→evil, and in figure 3, general ∼ person
ARG0-ofÐÐÐÐ→have-org-role-91 ARG2ÐÐ→general.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"AMR decomposes certain words by convention which must always be structurally aligned, such as ago ∼ before op1Ð→now and government ∼ government-organization
ARG0-ofÐÐÐÐ→govern-01.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Date, time, and value expressions.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"These expressions are aligned similarly to named entities, even though the normalized constants may not exactly match the words in the sentence.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"For example,
the DG structure 9:00 nummod←ÐÐÐÐpm would be represented in the AMR as date-entity timeÐÐ→21:00; tokens 9:00 and pm are treated as a multiword expression: each is lexically aligned to ""21:00"".",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we also align 9:00 nummod←ÐÐÐÐpm ∼ 21:00 and 9:00 nummod←ÐÐÐÐpm ∼ date-entity timeÐÐ→21:00.",A Details of alignment guidelines,[0],[0]

"Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Hassan et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2016; He et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2016, 2017; Wu et al., 2018b,a) has become more and more popular given its superior performance without the demand of heavily hand-crafted engineering efforts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

objective function during training is inconsistent with sequence-level evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To address the inconsistency issue, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been adopted to optimize sequence-level objectives.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, policy optimization methods such as REINFORCE (Ranzato et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017b) and actorcritic (Bahdanau et al., 2017) are leveraged for sequence generation tasks including NMT.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In machine translation community, a similar method is proposed with the name ‘minimum risk training’ (Shen et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"All these works demonstrate the effectiveness of RL techniques for NMT models (Wu et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, effectively applying RL to real-world NMT systems has not been fulfilled by previous works.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, most of, if not all, previous works verified their methods based on shallow recurrent neural network (RNN) models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, it is essential to leverage recently derived deep models (Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017), which are much more powerful.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, it is not easy to make RL practically effective given quite a few widely acknowledged limitations of RL method (Henderson et al., 2018) such as high variance of gradient estimation (Weaver and Tao, 2001), and objective instability (Mnih et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, several tricks are proposed in previous works.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, it remains unclear, and no agreement is achieved on how to use these tricks in machine translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, baseline reward method (Weaver and Tao, 2001) is suggested in (Ranzato et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016) but not leveraged in (He and Deng, 2012; Shen et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third, large-scale datasets, especially monolingual datasets are shown to significantly improve translation quality (Sennrich et al., 2015a; Xia et al.,

",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we try to fulfill these gaps and study how to practically apply RL to obtain strong NMT systems with quite competitive, even stateof-the-art performance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Several comprehensive studies are conducted on different aspects of RL training to figure out how to: 1) set efficient rewards; 2) combine MLE and RL objectives with different weights, which aims to stabilize the training procedure; 3) reduce the variance of gradient estimation.

"In addition, given the effectiveness of leveraging monolingual data in improving translation quality, we further propose a new method to combine the strength of both RL training and source/target monolingual data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"• We provide the first comprehensive study on different aspects of RL training, such as how to setup reward and baseline reward, on top of quite competitive NMT models.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We propose a new method that effectively leverages large-scale monolingual data, from both the source and target side, when training NMT models with RL.

"• Combined with several of our findings and method, we obtain the SOTA translation quality on WMT17 Zh-En translation task, surpassing strong baseline (Transformer big model + back translation) by nearly 1.5 BLEU points.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, on WMT14 En-De and WMT17 En-Zh translation tasks, we can also obtain strong competitive results.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We hope that our studies and findings will benefit the community to better understand and leverage reinforcement learning for developing strong
NMT models, especially in real-world scenarios faced with deep models and large amount of training data (including both parallel and monolingual data).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Towards this end, we open source all our codes/dataset at https://github.com/ apeterswu/RL4NMT to provide a clear recipe for performance reproduction.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this section, we first introduce the attentionbased sequence-to-sequence learning framework for neural machine translation (NMT), and then introduce the basis of applying reinforcement learning to training NMT models.",2 Background,[0],[0]
Typical NMT models are based on the encoderdecoder framework with attention mechanism.,2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
The encoder first maps a source sentence x =,2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"(x1, x2, ..., xn) to a set of continuous representations z = (z1, z2, ..., zn).",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Given z, the decoder then generates a target sentence y = (y1, y2, ..., ym) of word tokens one by one.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"At each decoding step t of model training, the probability of generating a token yt is maximized conditioned on x and y<t = (y1, ..., yt−1).",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Given N training sentence pairs {xi, yi}Ni=1, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is usually adopted to optimize the model, and the training objective is defined as:
Lmle = N∑ i=1",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"log p(yi|xi)
=",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
N∑ i=1,2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"m∑ t=1 log p(yit|yi1, ..., yit−1, xi), (1)
where m is the length of sentence yi.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Among all the encoder-decoder models, the recently proposed Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture achieves the best translation quality so far.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"The main difference between Transformer and previous RNNSearch (Bahdanau et al., 2015) or ConvS2S (Gehring et al., 2017) is that Transformer relies entirely on self-attention (Lin et al., 2017) to compute representations of source and target side sentences, without using recurrent or convolutional operations.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"As aforementioned, reinforcement learning (RL) is leveraged to bridge the gap between training and
inference of NMT, by directly optimizing the evaluation measure (e.g., BLEU) at training time.",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"Specifically, NMT model can be viewed as an agent, which interacts with the environment (the previous words y<t and the context vector z available at each step t).",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"The parameters of the agent define a policy, i.e., a conditional probability p(yt|x, y<t).",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"The agent will pick an action , i.e., a candidate word out from the vocabulary, according to the policy.",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
A terminal reward is observed once the agent generates a complete sequence ŷ.,2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"The reward for machine translation is the BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) score, denoted as R(ŷ, y), which is defined by comparing the generated ŷ with the ground-truth sentence",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"y. Note that here the reward R(ŷ, y) is the sentence-level reward, i.e., a scalar for each complete sentence ŷ.",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"The goal of the RL training is to maximize the expected reward:
Lrl = N∑ i=1",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"Eŷ∼p(ŷ|xi)R(ŷ, y i)
=",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"N∑ i=1 ∑ ŷ∈Y p(ŷ|xi)R(ŷ, yi), (2)
where Y is the space of all candidate translation sentences, which is exponentially large due to the large vocabulary size, making it impossible to exactly maximize Lrl.",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"In practice, REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) is usually leveraged to approximate the above expectation via sampling ŷ from the policy p(y|x), leading to the objective as maximizing:
L̂rl = N∑ i=1",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]

Throughout the paper we will use REINFORCE as our policy optimization method for RL training.",2.2 Training NMT with Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"Although training NMT with RL can fill in the gap between training objectives and evaluation metrics, it is not easy to successfully put RL training into practice.",3 Strategies for RL Training,[0],[0]
"A key challenge is that RL methods are highly unstable and inefficient, due to the noise in gradient estimation and reward computation.",3 Strategies for RL Training,[0],[0]
"To our best knowledge, currently there is no consensus, or even a systematic study on how to configure different setups for RL training to avoid such problems, especially for training deep NMT models on large scale datasets.",3 Strategies for RL Training,[0],[0]
"We therefore aim to shed light
on practical applications of RL for NMT training.",3 Strategies for RL Training,[0],[0]
"For this purpose, we provide a comprehensive review of several important methods to stabilize RL training process in this section.",3 Strategies for RL Training,[0],[0]
"It is critical to set up appropriate rewards for RL training, i.e., the R(ŷ, y) in Eqn.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
(3).,3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"There are two important aspects to consider in configuring the reward R(ŷ, y): how to sample training instance ŷ and whether to use reward shaping.
",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
Generate ŷ,3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"There are two strategies to sample ŷ for computing the BLEU reward R(ŷ, y).",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"The first one is beam search (Sutskever et al., 2014), it is a breadth-first search method that maintains a “beam” of the top-K scoring candidates (prefix hypothesis sentences) at each generation step.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Then, for each candidate sentence in the beam,K most likely words are appended, resulting in a pool of K ×K new candidates.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Out from this pool, the top-K translations with largest probabilities are selected, and the beam search process continues.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"The second strategy is multinomial sampling (Chatterjee and Cancedda, 2010), which produces each word one by one through multinomial sampling over the model’s output distribution.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Both sampling strategies terminate the expansion of a candidate sentence when an ‘end of sentence’ (<EOS>) token is met.
",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
The choice of different sampling strategies reflects the exploration-exploitation dilemma.,3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Beam search strategy generates more accurate ŷ by exploiting the probabilistic space output via current NMT model, while multinomial sampling pays more attention to explore more diverse candidates.
",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
Whether to Use Reward Shaping From Eqn.,3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"(3) we can see that for the entire sequence ŷ, there is only one terminal reward R(ŷ, y) available for model training.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Note that the agent needs to take tens of actions (with the number depending on the length of ŷ) to generate a complete sentence ŷ, but only one reward is available for all those actions.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Consequently, RL training is inefficient due to the sparsity of rewards, and the model updates each token in the training sentence with the same reward value without distinction.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Reward shaping (Ng et al., 1999) is a strategy to overcome this shortcoming.",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"In reward shaping, intermediate reward at each decoding step t is imposed and denoted as rt(ŷt, y).",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"Bahdanau et al. (2017) sets up the intermediate reward as rt(ŷt, y) = R(ŷ1...t, y)",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"− R(ŷ1...t−1, y), where R(ŷ1...t, y) is defined as the BLEU score
of ŷ1...t with respect to y. Note that we have R(ŷ, y) = ∑m t=1 rt(ŷt, y), where m is the length
of ŷ. During RL training, the cumulative reward∑m τ=t rτ (ŷτ , y) is used to update the policy at time step t. It is verified that using the shaped reward rt instead of awarding the whole score R(ŷ, y) does not change the optimal policy (Ng et al., 1999).",3.1 Reward Computation,[0],[0]
"As mentioned before, the REINFORCE algorithm suffers from high variance in gradient estimation, mainly caused by using single sample ŷ to estimate the expectation.",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"To reduce the variance, Ranzato et al. (2016) subtracts an average reward from the returned reward at each time step t, and the actual reward used to update the policy is
R(ŷ, y)− r̂t, (4)
where r̂t is the estimated average reward at step t, named as baseline reward (Weaver and Tao, 2001).",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"Together with reward shaping, the updated reward becomes ∑m τ=t rτ (ŷτ , y)− r̂t at step t.
Intuitively speaking, a baseline reward r̂t is established, which either encourages a word choice ŷt if the induced reward R satisfies R > r̂t, or discourages it if R < r̂t.",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"Here R is either the terminal reward R(ŷ, y) or the cumulative reward∑m
τ=t rτ (ŷτ , y).",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"Such estimated baseline reward r̂t is designed to decrease the high variance of the gradient estimator.
",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"In practice, the baseline reward r̂t can be obtained through different approaches.",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"For example, one may sample multiple sentences and use the mean terminal reward for these sentences as baseline reward.",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"In our work, we adopt the function learning approach, using simple network (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) to build the learning function, which is the same as used in (Ranzato et al., 2016; Bahdanau et al., 2017).",3.2 Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation,[0],[0]
"The last important strategy we would like to mention is the combination of MLE training objective with RL objective, which is assumed to further stabilize RL training process (Wu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017a).
",3.3 Combine MLE and RL Objectives,[0],[0]
"A simple way is to linearly combine the MLE (Eqn. (1)) and RL (Eqn. (3)) objectives as follows:
Lcom = α ∗",3.3 Combine MLE and RL Objectives,[0],[0]
"Lmle + (1− α) ∗ L̂rl, (5)
where α is the hyperparamter controlling the tradeoff between MLE and RL objectives.",3.3 Combine MLE and RL Objectives,[0],[0]
We will empirically evaluate how different values of α impact the final translation accuracy.,3.3 Combine MLE and RL Objectives,[0],[0]
Previous works typically conduct RL training with only bilingual data for NMT.,4 RL Training with Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"Monolingual data has been proved to be able to significantly improve the performance of NMT systems (Sennrich et al., 2015a; Xia et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2016).",4 RL Training with Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
It remains an open problem whether it is possible to combine the benefits of RL training and monolingual data such that even more competitive results can be obtained.,4 RL Training with Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
In this section we provide several solutions for combination and will study them in next section.,4 RL Training with Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"Note that all the settings discussed in this section are semi-supervised learning, i.e., both bilingual and monolingual data are available.",4 RL Training with Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
We first provide a solution to RL training with source-side monolingual data.,4.1 With Source-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
As shown in Eqn.,4.1 With Source-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"(3), in RL training we need to calculate the reward signal R(ŷ, y) for each generated sentence ŷ, and therefore the reference sentence y seems to be a must-have, which unfortunately is missing for source-side monolingual data.
",4.1 With Source-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
We tackle this challenge via generating pseudo target reference y by bootstrapping with the model itself.,4.1 With Source-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"Apparently, for the source-side monolingual data, the pseudo target reference y should have good translation quality.",4.1 With Source-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"Therefore, for each source-side monolingual sentence, we use the NMT model trained from the bilingual data to beam search a target sentence and treat it as the pseudo target reference y. Afterwards ŷ is obtained via multinomial sampling to calculate the reward.",4.1 With Source-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"Although multinomial sampling is usually not as good as sampling via beam search, the combination of beam search (to get the pseudo target reference sentence) and the multinomial sampling (to generate the action sequence of the agent) achieves good exploration-exploitation trade-off, since the pseudo target reference exploits the accuracy of current NMT model while ŷ achieves better exploration.",4.1 With Source-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"For a target-side monolingual sentence, its source sentence x is missing, and consequently ŷ is unavailable since it is sampled based on",4.2 With Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"x. We tackle
this challenge via back translation (Sennrich et al., 2015a).",4.2 With Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
We first train a reverse NMT model from the target language to the source language with bilingual data.,4.2 With Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"For each target-side monolingual sentence, using the reverse NMT model, we back translate it to get its pseudo source sentence x.",4.2 With Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"We then pair the target monolingual data and its backtranslated sentence as a pseudo bilingual sentence pair, which can be used for RL training in the same way as the genuine bilingual sentence pairs.",4.2 With Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
A natural extension of previous discussions is to combine both the source-side and target-side monolingual data for RL training.,4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"We consider two combinations, the sequential method and the unified method.",4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
The former one sequentially leverages the source-side and target-side monolingual data for RL training.,4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we first train an MLE model using the bilingual data and source-side (or target-side) monolingual data; based on this MLE model, we then use REINFORCE for training with target-side (or source-side) monolingual data.",4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"For unified approach, we pack the paired data out from three domains together: the genuine bilingual data, the source monolingual data with its pseudo target references (introduced in subsection 4.1), and the target monolingual data with its back-translated samples (introduced in subsection 4.2).",4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
Then we treat the combined data as normal bilingual data on which the NMT model is trained via MLE or RL principles.,4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
Our goal is to investigate the model performance with different training data and find the best recipe of how to use these data in RL training.,4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
More details are introduced in next section.,4.3 With both Source-Side and Target-Side Monolingual Data,[0],[0]
"In this section, we provide a systematic study on aforementioned RL training strategies and the solutions of leveraging monolingual data.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The RL training strategies are evaluated on bilingual datasets from three translation tasks, WMT14 EnglishGerman (En-De), WMT17 English-Chinese (EnZh) and WMT17 Chinese-English (Zh-En), and we further conduct the experiments to leverage monolingual data in WMT17 Zh-En translation.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the bilingual datasets, WMT17 (Bojar et al., 2017) En-Zh 1 and WMT17 Zh-En use the same dataset, which contains about 24M sentences pairs, including CWMT Corpus 2017 and UN Parallel Corpus V1.0.",5.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
The Jieba2 segmenter is used to perform Chinese word segmentation.,5.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]

"For the monolingual dataset on Zh-En translation task, similar to (Sennrich et al., 2017), the Chinese monolingual data comes from LDC Chinese Gigaword (4th edition) and the English monolingual data comes from News Crawl 2016 articles.",5.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"After preprocessing (e.g., language detection and filtering sentences with more than 80 words), we keep 4M Chinese sentences and 7M English sentences.
",5.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"We adopt the Transformer model with transformer big setting as defined in (Vaswani et al., 2017) for Zh-En and En-Zh translations, which achieves SOTA translation quality in several other datasets.",5.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"For En-De translation, we utilize the transformer base v1 setting.",5.1 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]

"The results are shown in Table 1, where “RL” stands for RL training with the REINFORCE algorithm.",5.2 Results of of RL Training Strategies,[0],[0]
We also report the performance of the pretrained NMT model with the MLE loss.,5.2 Results of of RL Training Strategies,[0],[0]
"From the table, an interesting finding is that ŷ sampled via beam search strategy is worse than that by multinomial sampling, with a gap of roughly 0.2-0.3 BLEU points on the test set (with significant test score ρ < 0.05).",5.2 Results of of RL Training Strategies,[0],[0]
"We therefore conjecture that exploration is more important than exploitation in reward computing: multinomial sampling brings more data diversity to the training of NMT model, while sentences generated by beam search are usually very similar to each other.",5.2 Results of of RL Training Strategies,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we find that there is no big difference between the leverage of reward shaping or terminal reward, with only slightly better performance of reward shaping.",5.2 Results of of RL Training Strategies,[0],[0]

Variance Reduction of Gradient Estimation Next we evaluate the strategies for reducing variance of gradient estimation (see section3.2).,34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
We want to know whether the baseline reward is necessary.,34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
"To compute the baseline reward, similar to (Ranzato et al., 2016; Bahdanau et al., 2017), we build a two-layer MLP regressor with Relu (Nair and Hinton, 2010) activation units.",34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
"The function takes the hidden states from decoder as input, and the parameters of the regressor are trained to minimize the mean squared loss of Eqn. (4).",34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
"We first pre-train the baseline function for 20k steps/minibatches, and then jointly train NMT model (with RL) and the baseline reward function.
",34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows that the learning of baseline reward does not help RL training.,34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
"This contradicts with previous observations (Ranzato et al., 2016), and seems to suggest that the variance of gradient estimation in NMT is not as large as we expected.",34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
"The reason might be that the probability mass on the target-side language space induced by the NMT model is highly concentrated, making the sampled ŷ representative enough in terms of estimating the expectation.",34.47 34.50 34.63 34.56 34.44 34.40,[0],[0]
"Therefore, for the economic perspective, it is not necessary to add the additional steps of using baseline reward on RL training for NMT.

"In this paper, we build on prior computational work that has focused on analyzing formality of texts (Lahiri and Lu, 2011; Brooke and Hirst, 2013; Pavlick and Nenkova, 2015; Pavlick and Tetreault, 2016) with a different aim: modeling formality for the purpose of controlling style in applications that generate language, with a focus on machine translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Human translators translate a document for a specific audience (Nida and Taber Charles, 1969), and often ask what is the expected tone of the content when taking a new translation job.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We design a machine translation system that operates under similar conditions and explicitly takes an expected level of formality as input.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While ultimately we would like systems to preserve the formality of the source, this is a
challenging task that requires not only automatically inferring the formality of the source, but also understanding how formality differs across languages and cultures.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a first step, we therefore limit our study to the scenario where the expected output formality is given to the MT system as an additional input.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We first select a formality model providing the most accurate scores on intrinsic formality datasets.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We compare existing lexical formality models and novel variants based on inducing formality dimensions or subspaces in vector space models.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We then turn to machine translation and show that a lexical formality model can have a positive impact when used to control the formality of machine translation output.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"When the expected formality matches the reference, we obtain improvement of translation quality evaluated by automatic metrics (BLEU).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A human assessment also verified the effectiveness of our proposed system in generating translations at diverse levels of formality.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our goal is to provide systems with the ability to generate language across a range of formality style.,2 Formality-Sensitive MT,[0],[0]
"We propose a Formality-Sensitive Machine Translation (FSMT) scenario where the system takes two inputs: (1) text in the source language to be translated, and (2) a desired formality level capturing the intended audience of the translation.",2 Formality-Sensitive MT,[0],[0]
We propose to implement it as n-best re-ranking within a standard phrase-based MT architecture.,2 Formality-Sensitive MT,[0],[0]

Lexical scores can then simply be obtained by projecting word representations onto the formality subspace.,3.1 Lexical Formality,[0],[0]
One example is training a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model on word representations of all seeds.,3.1 Lexical Formality,[0],[0]
This method is based on the assumption that representative formal/informal words principally vary along the direction of formality.,3.1 Lexical Formality,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, inspired by DENSIFIER (Rothe et al., 2016), we can learn a subspace that aims at separating words in Sf vs. words in Si and grouping words in the same set.",3.1 Lexical Formality,[0],[0]
"While previous work scored sentence by averaging word scores (Brooke and Hirst, 2014; Pavlick and Nenkova, 2015), we propose a weighted average scheme for word sequences W to downgrade the formality contribution of neutral words:
Formality(W ) =∑ wi∈W |Formality(wi)| · Formality(wi)∑
wi∈W |Formality(wi)|",3.2 From Word to Sentence Formality,[0],[0]
"Before evaluating our FSMT framework, we evaluate the formality models at the sentence level.",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Lahiri (2015) and Pavlick and Tetreault (2016) collected 5-way human scores for 11,263 sentences in the genres of blog, email, answers and news.",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Following Pavlick and Tetreault (2016), we averaged human scores for each sentence as the
gold standard.",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As in prior work, the score quality was evaluated by the Spearman correlation.

A large mixed-topic corpus is required to train vector space models.,3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As suggested by Brooke et al. (2010), we used the ICWSM 2009 Spinn3r dataset (English tier-1) which consists of about 1.6 billion words (Burton et al., 2009).",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
We also compared the term-document association model,3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) and the term-term association model word2vec (W2V) (Mikolov et al., 2013).",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We used the same 105 formal seeds and 138 informal seeds as Brooke et al. (2010).
",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Followed Brooke et al. (2010), to achieve best performance, we used a small dimensionality (10) for training LSA and word2vec.",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In practice, we normalized the LSA word vectors to make them have unit length for SVM and PCA, but did not applied it to word2vec.",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This suggests that the magnitude of LSA word vectors is harmful for formality modeling.
",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also compared formality models based on word representations to a baseline that relies on unigram models to compare word statistics in corpora representative of formal vs. informal language (Pavlick and Nenkova, 2015).",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This method requires language examples of diverse formality.,3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Conversational transcripts are generally considered as casual text, so we concatenated corpora such as Fisher (Cieri et al., 2004), Switchboard (Godfrey et al., 1992), SBCSAE (Bois et al., 2000- 2005), CallHome1, CallFriend2, BOLT",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"SMS/Chat (Song et al., 2014) and NPS Chatroom (Forsythand and Martell, 2007).",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As the formal counterpart, we extracted comparable size of text from Europarl (Koehn, 2005).",3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This results in 30 Million tokens of formal corpora (1.1M segments) and 29 Million tokens of informal corpora (2.7M segments).

Table 1 shows that all models based on the vector space achieve similar performance in terms of Spearman’s ρ (except SVM-W2V which yields lower performance).,3.3 Evaluation,[0],[0]

Set-up We evaluate this approach on a French to English translation task.,4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"Two parallel FrenchEnglish corpora are used: (1) MultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010), which is extracted from the United Nations website, and can be considered to be formal text; (2) OpenSubtitles2016 (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016), which is extracted from movie and TV subtitles, covers a wider spectrum of styles, but overall tends to be informal since it primarily contains conversations.",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"Each parallel corpus was split into a training set (100M English tokens), a tuning set (2.5K segments) and a test set (5K segments).",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"Two corpora are then concatenated, such that training, tuning and test sets all contained a diversity of styles.",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]

"Since such references are not available, we construct three sets of test data where instances are divided according to the formality level of the available reference translation.",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"The formality distribution in the tuning set shows that 97% reference translations fall into the range of [−0.6, 0.6].",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"We therefore set three formality bins – informal [−1,−0.2), neutral formality",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"[−0.2, 0.2], and formal (0.2, 1] – and split the test set into these bins.",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"We use DENSIFIER-LSA and training setting described above to translate the entire test set three times, with three different formality levels: low (-0.4), neutral (0) and high (0.4).",4 Evaluation of the FSMT System,[0],[0]
"We first report standard automatic evaluation results using the BLEU score to compare FSMT output given different desired formality level on each bins (See Table 2).
",4.1 Automatic Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The best BLEU scores for each formality level are obtained when the level of formality given as input to the MT system matches the nature of the text being translated, as can be seen in the scores along the diagonal in Table 2.",4.1 Automatic Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Comparing with the baseline system, which produces the top translation from each n-best list, translation quality improves by +0.5 BLEU on informal text, +0.3 BLEU on neutral text, and remains constant on formal text.",4.1 Automatic Evaluation,[0],[0]
The impact increases with the distance to formal language increases.,4.1 Automatic Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This can be explained by the fact that more formal sentences tend to be longer, and the impact of alternate lexical choice for a small number of words per sentence is smaller in longer sentences.",4.1 Automatic Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In addition, the formal sentences are mostly drawn from UN data which is sufficiently different from the other genres in the heterogeneous training corpus that the informal examples do not affect baseline per-
formance on formal data.",4.1 Automatic Evaluation,[0],[0]
Automatic evaluation is limited to comparing output to a single reference: lower BLEU scores conflate translation errors and stylistic mismatch.,4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we conduct a human study of the formality vs. the quality.
",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
We conducted a manual evaluation of the output of our FSMT system taking low/high formality levels (-0.4/0.4) as parameters.,4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
42 translation pairs were randomly selected and were annotated by 15 volunteers.,4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"For each pair of segments, the volunteers were asked to select the segment that would be more appropriate in a formal setting (e.g., a job interview) than in a casual setting (e.g., chatting with friends).",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"A default option of “neither of them is more formal or hard to say” was also available.
",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"By majority voting, 20 pairs were annotated as “N”, indicating the two translations has no distinctions w.r.t. formality.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"For example, “A: how can they do this” vs. “B: how can they do that”.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Given that the translations were restricted to the nbest list, not all sentences could be translated into stylistically different language.
",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Of the remaining 21 pairs where annotators judged one output more formal than the other, in all but one case the translation produced by our FSMT system with high formality level parameter was judged to be more formal.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Overall this indicates that our formality scoring and ranking procedure are effective.
To determine whether re-ranking based on formality might have a detrimental effect on quality, we also had annotators rate the fluency and adequacy of the segments.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Inspired by Graham et al. (2013), annotators were first asked to assess fluency without a reference and separately adequacy with a reference.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
Both assessments used a sliding scale.,4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
Each segment was evaluated by an average of 7 annotators.,4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"After rescaling the ratings into the [0, 1] range, we observed a 0.75 level of fluency for informal translations and 0.70 for formal ones.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
This slight difference fits our expectation that more casual language may feel more fluent while more formal language may feel more stilted.,4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"The adequacy ratings were 0.65 and 0.64 for informal and translations respectively, indicating that adjusting the level of formality had minimal effect on the adequacy of the result.
",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
Some examples are listed in Table 3.,4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Occa-
sionally, the n-best list had no translation hypotheses with diverse formality, so the FSMT system dropped necessary words, appended inessential words, or selected improper or even incorrect words to fit the target formality level.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"In the case of ’how do you do’, the translation that was meant to be more casual was rated more formal.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Because the system measures formality on the lexical level, it was not able to recognize this idiomatically formal phrase made up of words that are not inherently formal.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]
"Despite these issues, most of the output were formality-variant translations of the same French source segment, as expected.",4.2 Human Assessment,[0],[0]

"The media and the public are currently discussing the recent phenomenon of “fake news” and its potential role in swaying elections, how it may affect society, and what can and should be done about it.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Prone to misunderstanding and misue, the term “fake news” arose from the observation that, in social media, a certain kind of ‘news’ spreads much more successfully than others, and this kind of ‘news’ is typically extremely one-sided (hyperpartisan), inflammatory, emotional, and often riddled with untruths.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although traditional yellow press has been spreading ‘news’ of varying de-
grees of truthfulness long before the digital revolution, its amplification over real news within social media gives many people pause.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The fake news hype caused a widespread disillusionment about social media, and many politicians, news publishers, IT companies, activists, and scientists concur that this is where to draw the line.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For all their good intentions, however, it must be drawn very carefully (if at all), since nothing less than free speech is at stake—a fundamental right of every free society.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Many favor a two-step approach where fake news items are detected and then countermeasures are implemented to foreclose rumors and to discourage repetition.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While some countermeasures are already tried in practice, such as displaying warnings and withholding ad revenue, fake news detection is still in its infancy.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"At any rate, a nearreal time reaction is crucial: once a fake news item begins to spread virally, the damage is done and undoing it becomes arduous.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since knowledge-based and context-based approaches to fake news detection can only be applied after publication, i.e., as news events unfold and as social interactions occur, they may not be fast enough.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We have identified style-based approaches as a viable alternative, allowing for instantaneous reactions, albeit not to fake news, but to hyperpartisanship.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this regard we contribute (1) a large news corpus annotated by experts with respect to veracity and hyperpartisanship, (2) extensive experiments on discriminating fake news, hyperpartisan news, and satire based solely on writing style, and (3) validation experiments to verify our finding that the writing style of the left and the right have more in common than any of the two have with the mainstream, applying Unmasking in a novel way.

"After a review of related work, Section 3 details the corpus and its construction, Section 4 introduces our methodology, and Section 5 reports the results of the aforementioned experiments.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Approaches to fake news detection divide into three categories (Figure 1): they can be knowledge-based (by relating to known facts), context-based (by analyzing news spread in social media), and stylebased (by analyzing writing style).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Knowledge-based fake news detection.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Methods from information retrieval have been proposed early on to determine the veracity of web documents.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, Etzioni et al. (2008) propose to identify inconsistencies by matching claims extracted from the web with those of a document in question.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Magdy and Wanas (2010) measure the frequency of documents that support a claim.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Both approaches face the challenges of web data credibility, namely expertise, trustworthiness, quality, and reliability (Ginsca et al., 2015).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Other approaches rely on knowledge bases, including the semantic web and linked open data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wu et al. (2014) “perturb” a claim in question to query knowledge bases, using the result variations as indicator of the support a knowledge base offers for the claim.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Ciampaglia et al. (2015) use the shortest path between concepts in a knowledge graph, whereas Shi and Weninger (2016) use a link prediction algorithm.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, these approaches are unsuited for new claims without corresponding entries in a knowledge base, whereas knowledge bases can be manipulated (Heindorf et al., 2016).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Context-based fake news detection.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Here, fake news items are identified via meta information and spread patterns.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, Long et al. (2017) show that author information can be a useful feature for fake news detection, and Derczynski et al. (2017) attempt to determine the veracity of a claim based on the conversation it sparks on Twitter as one of the RumourEval tasks.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The Facebook analysis of Mocanu et al. (2015) shows that unsubstantiated claims spread as widely as well-established ones, and that user groups predisposed to conspiracy theories are more open to sharing the former.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Acemoglu et al. (2010), Kwon et al. (2013), Ma et al. (2017), and Volkova et al. (2017) model the spread of (mis-)information, while Budak et al. (2011) and Nguyen et al. (2012) propose algorithms to limit its spread.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The efficacy of countermeasures like debunking sites is studied by Tambuscio et al. (2015).,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"While achieving good results, context-based approaches suffer from working only a posteriori, requiring large amounts of data, and disregarding the actual news content.

"Fake news detection
Style-based fake news detection.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Deception detection originates from forensic linguistics and builds on the Undeutsch hypothesis—a result from forensic psychology which asserts that memories of reallife, self-experienced events differ in content and quality from imagined events (Undeutsch, 1967).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The hypothesis led to the development of forensic tools to assess testimonies at the statement level.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Some approaches operationalize deception detection at scale to detect uncertainty in social media posts, for example Wei et al. (2013) and Chen et al. (2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this regard, Rubin et al. (2015) use rhetorical structure theory as a measure of story coherence and as an indicator for fake news.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recently, Wang (2017) collected a large dataset consisting of sentence-length statements along their veracity from the fact-checking site PolitiFact.com, and then used style features to detect false statements.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"A related task is stance detection, where the goal is to detect the relation between a claim about an article, and the article itself (Bourgonje et al., 2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Most prominently, stance detection was the task of the Fake News Challenge1 which ran in 2017 and received 50 submissions, albeit hardly any participants published their approach.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]

Where deception detection focuses on single statements, style-based text categorization as proposed by Argamon-Engelson et al. (1998) assesses entire texts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Common applications are author profiling (age, gender, etc.) and genre classification.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Though susceptible to authors who can modify their writing style, such obfuscations may be detectable (e.g., Afroz et al. (2012)).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As an early precursor to fake news detection, Badaskar et al. (2008) train models to identify news items that were automatically generated.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Currently, text categorization methods for fake news detection focus mostly on satire detection (e.g., Rubin et al. (2016), Yang et al. (2017)).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Rashkin et al. (2017) perform a statistical analysis of the stylistic differences between real, satire, hoax, and propaganda news.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We make use of their results by incorporating the bestperforming style features identified.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, two preprint papers have been recently shared.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Horne and Adali (2017) use style features for fake news detection.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, the relatively high accuracies reported must be taken with a grain of salt: their two datasets comprise only 70 news articles each, whose ground-truth is based on where an article came from, instead of resulting from a per-article expert review as in our case; their final classifier uses only 4 features (number of nouns, type-token ratio, word count, number of quotes), which can be easily manipulated; and based on their experimental setup, it cannot be ruled out that the classifier simply differentiates news portals rather than fake and real articles.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
We avoid this problem by testing our classifiers on articles from portals which were not represented in the training data.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Pérez-Rosas et al. (2017) also report on constructing two datasets comprising around 240 and 200 news article excerpts (i.e., the 5-sentence lead) with a balanced distribution of fake vs. real.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The former was collected via crowdsourcing, asking workers to write a fake news item based on a real news item, the latter was collected from the web.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For style analysis, the former dataset may not be suitable, since the authors note themselves that “workers succeeded in mimicking the reporting style from the original news”.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The latter dataset encompasses only celebrity news (i.e., yellow press), which introduces a bias.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their feature selection follows that of Rubin et al. (2016), which is covered by our experiments, but also incorporates topic features, rendering the resulting classifier not generalizable.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]

"Therefore, posts were rated “mostly true,” “mixture of true and false,” “mostly false,” or, if the post was opinion-driven or otherwise lacked a factual claim, “no factual content.”",3.1 Corpus Construction,[0],[0]
"Four BuzzFeed journalists worked on the manual fact-checks of the news articles: to minimize costs, each article was reviewed only once and articles were assigned round robin.",3.1 Corpus Construction,[0],[0]

"For sake of reproducibility, all our code has been published.4",4 Methodology,[0],[0]
Our writing style model incorporates common features as well as ones specific to the news domain.,4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"The former are n-grams, n in [1, 3], of characters, stop words, and parts-of-speech.",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"Further, we employ 10 readability scores5 and dictionary features, each indicating the frequency of words from a tailor-made dictionary in a document, using the General Inquirer Dictionaries as a basis (Stone et al., 1966).",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"The domain-specific features include ratios of quoted words and external links, the number of paragraphs, and their average length.
",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"In each of our experiments, we carefully select from the aforementioned features the ones worthwhile using: all features are discarded that are hardly represented in our corpus, namely word tokens that occur in less than 2.5% of the documents, and n-gram features that occur in less than 10% of the documents.",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"Discarding these features prevents overfitting and improves the chances that our model will generalize.
",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"If not stated otherwise, our experiments share a common setup.",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"In order to avoid biases from the respective training sets, we balance them using oversampling.",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we perform 3-fold cross-validation where each fold comprises one publisher from each orientation, so that the classifier does not learn a publisher’s style.",4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
For nonUnmasking experiments we use WEKA’s random forest implementation with default settings.,4.1 Style Features and Feature Selection,[0],[0]
"Unmasking, as proposed by Koppel et al. (2007), is a meta learning approach for authorship verification.",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
"We study for the first time whether it can be used to assess the similarity of more broadly defined style categories, such as left-wing vs. rightwing vs. mainstream news.",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]

Originally, Unmasking takes two documents as input and outputs its confidence whether they have been written by the same author.",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
"Three steps are taken to accomplish this: first, each document is chunked into a set of at least 500-word long chunks; second, classification errors are measured while iteratively removing the most discriminative features of a style model consisting of the 250 most frequent words, separating the two chunk sets with a linear classifier; and third, the resulting classification accuracy curves are analyzed with regard to their slope.",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
"A steep decrease is more likely than a shallow decrease if the two documents have been written by the same author, since there are presumably less discriminating features between documents written by the same author than between documents written by different authors.",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
"Training a classifier on many examples of error curves obtained from same-author document pairs and differentauthor document pairs yields an effective authorship verifier—at least for long documents that can be split up into a sufficient number of chunks.
",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
It turns out that what applies to the style of authors also applies to genre styles.,4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
"We adapt Unmasking by skipping its first step and using two sets of documents (e.g., left-wing articles and rightwing articles) as input.",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
"When plotting classification error curves for visual inspection, steeper decreases in these plots, too, indicate higher style similarity of the two input document sets, just as with chunk sets of two documents written by the same author.",4.2 Unmasking Genre Styles,[0],[0]
"We employ four baseline models: a topic-based bag of words model, often used in the literature, but less practical since news topics change frequently and drastically; a model using only the domain-specific news style features to check whether the differences between categories measured as corpus statistics play a significant role; and naive baselines that classify all items into one of the categories in question, relating our results to the class distributions.",4.3 Baselines,[0],[0]
"Classification performance is measured as accuracy, and class-wise precision, recall, and F1.",4.4 Performance Measures,[0],[0]
"We favor these measures over, e.g., areas under the ROC curve or the precision recall curve for simplicity sake.",4.4 Performance Measures,[0],[0]

"We report on the results of two series of experiments that investigate style differences and similarities between hyperpartisan and mainstream news, and between fake, real, and satire news, shedding light on the following questions:
1.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Can (left/right) hyperpartisanship be distinguished from the mainstream?,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
2.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Is style-based fake news detection feasible?,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
3.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Can fake news be distinguished from satire?,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our first experiment addressing the first question uncovered an odd behavior of our classifier: it would often misjudge left-wing for right-wing news, while being much better at distinguishing both combined from the mainstream.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To explain this behavior, we hypothesized that maybe the writing style of the hyperpartisan left and right are more similar to one another than to the mainstream.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To investigate this hypothesis, we devised two additional validation experiments, yielding three sources of evidence instead of just one.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
A. Predicting orientation.,5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Table 2 shows the classification performance of a ternary classifier trained to discriminate left, right, and mainstream—an obvious first experiment for our dataset.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Separating the left and right orientation from the mainstream does not work too well: the topic baseline outperforms the style-based models with regard to accuracy, whereas the results for class-wise precision and recall are a mixed bag.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
The left-wing articles are apparently significantly more difficult to be identified compared to articles from the other two orientations.,5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"When we inspected the confusion matrix (not shown), it turned out that 66% of misclassifications of left-wing articles are falsely classified as right-wing articles, whereas 60% of all misclassified right-wing articles are classified as mainstream articles.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Misclassified mainstream articles spread almost evenly across the other classes.
",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"The poor performance of the domain-specific news style features by themselves demonstrate that orientation cannot be discriminated based on the basic corpus characteristics observed with respect to paragraphs, quotations, and hyperlinks.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]

",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Comparing Table 2 and Table 3, we were left with a riddle: all other things being equal, how could it be that hyperpartisanship in general can be much better discriminated from the mainstream than individual orientation?",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Attempts to answer this question gave rise to our aforementioned hypothesis that, perhaps, the writing style of hyperpartisan left and right are not altogether different, despite their opposing agendas.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Or put another way, if style and topic are orthogonal concepts, then being an extremist should not exert a different style dependent on political orientation.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Excited, we sought ways to independently disprove the hypothesis, and found two: Experiments C and D.
C. Validation using leave-out classification.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"If leftwing and right-wing articles have a more similar style than either of them compared to mainstream articles, then what class would a binary classifier assign to a left-wing article, if it were trained to distinguish only the right-wing from the mainstream, and vice versa?",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
Table 4 shows the results of this experiment.,5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"As indicated by proportions well above 0.50, full style-based classifiers have a tendency of clas-
sifying left as right and right as left.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"The topic baseline, though, gets confused especially when omitting right articles from the training set with performance close to random.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"The fact that the topic baseline works better when omitting left from the training set may be explainable: leading up to the elections, the hyperpartisan left was often merely reacting to topics prompted by the hyperpartisan right, instead of bringing up their own.
",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
D. Validation using Unmasking.,5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Based on Koppel et al.’s original approach in the context of authorship verification, for the first time, we generalize Unmasking to assess genre styles: just like author style similarity, genre style similarity will be characterized by the slope of a given Unmasking curve, where a steeper decrease indicates higher similarity.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"We apply Unmasking as described in Section 4.2 onto pairs of sets of left, right, and mainstream articles.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows the resulting Unmasking curves (Unmasking is symmetrical, hence three curves).",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"The curves are averaged over 5 runs, where each run comprised sets of 100 articles from each orientation.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"In case of the left-wing orientation, where less than 500 articles are available in our corpus, once all of them had been used, they were shuffled again to select articles for the remainder of the runs.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, the curve comparing left vs. right has a distinctly steeper slope than either of the others.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"This result hence matches the findings of the previous experiments.
",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"With caution, we conclude that the evidence gained from our three independent experimental setups supports our hypothesis that the hyperpartisan left and the hyperpartisan right have more in common in terms of writing style than any of the two have with the mainstream.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
"Another more tangible (e.g., practical) outcome of Experiment B is the finding that hyperpartisan news can apparently be
discriminated well from the mainstream: in particular the high recall of 0.89 at a reasonable precision of 0.69 gives us confidence that, with some further effort, a practical classifier can be built that detects hyperpartisan news at scale and in real time, since an article’s style can be assessed immediately without referring to external information.",5.1 Hyperpartisanship vs. Mainstream,[0],[0]
This series of experiments targets research questions (2) and (3).,5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Again, we conduct three experiments, where the first is about predicting veracity, and the last two about discriminating satire.
",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
A. Predicting veracity.,5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"When taking into account that the mainstream news publishers in our corpus did not publish any news items that are mostly false, and only very few instances that are mixtures of true and false, we may safely disregard them for the task of fake news detection.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"A reliable classifier for hyperpartisan news can act as a prefilter for a subsequent, more in-depth fake news detection approach, which may in turn be tailored to a much more narrowly defined classification task.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"We hence use only the left-wing articles and the right-wing articles of our corpus for our attempt at a style-based fake news classifier.
Table 5 shows the performance values for a generic classifier that predicts fake news across orientations, and orientation-specific classifiers that have been individually trained on articles from either orientation.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Although all classifiers outperform the naive baselines of classifying everything into one of the classes in terms of precision, the slight increase comes at the cost of a large decrease in recall.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"While the orientation-specific classifiers are slightly better for most metrics, none of them outperform the naive baselines regarding the F - Measure.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"We conclude that style-based fake news classification simply does not work in general.
B. Predicting satire.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Yet, not all fake news are the same.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"One should distinguish satire from the rest, which takes the form of news but lies more or less obviously to amuse its readers.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Regardless the problems that spreading fake news may cause, satire should never be filtered, but be discriminated from other fakes.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Table 6 shows the performance values of our classifier in the satire-detection setting used by Rubin et al. (2016) (the S-n-L News DB corpus), distinguishing satire from real news.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
This setting uses a balanced 3:1 training-to-test set split over 360 articles (180 per class).,5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"As can be seen, our style-based model significantly outperforms all baselines across the board, achieving an accuracy of 0.82, and an F score of 0.81.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"It clearly improves over topic classification, but does not outperform Rubin et al.’s classifier, which includes features based on topic, absurdity, grammar, and punctuation.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"We argue that incorporating topic into satire detection is not appropriate, since the topics of satire change along the topics of news.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
A classifier with topic features therefore does not generalize.,5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Apparently, a style-based model is competitive, and we believe that satire can be detected at scale this way, so as to prevent other fake news detection technology from falsely filtering it.
",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
C. Unmasking satire.,5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Given the above results on stylistic similarities between left and right news, the question remains how satire fits into the picture.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"We assess the style similarity of satire from Rubin et al.’s corpus compared to fake news and real news from ours, again applying Unmasking to compare pairs of the three categories of news as described above.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Figure 3 shows the resulting Un-
masking curves.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
The curve for the pair of fake vs. real news drops faster compared to the other two pairs.,5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Apparently, the style of fake news has more in common with that of real news than either of the two have with satire.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"These results are encouraging: satire is distinct enough from fake and real news, so that, just like with hyperpartisan news compared to mainstream news, it can be discriminated with reasonable accuracy.",5.2 Fake vs. Real (vs. Satire),[0],[0]
"Fact-checking for fake news detection poses an interdisciplinary challenge: technology is required to extract factual statements from text, to match facts with a knowledge base, to dynamically retrieve and maintain knowledge bases from the web, to reliably assess the overall veracity of an entire article rather than individual statements, to do so in real time as news events unfold, to monitor the spread of fake news within and across social media, to measure the reputation of information sources, and to raise awareness in readers.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"These are only the most salient things that need be done to tackle the problem, and as our cross-section of related work shows, a large body of work must be covered.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Notwithstanding the many attacks on fake news by developing one way or another of fact-checking, we believe it worthwhile to mount our attack from another angle: writing style.
",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We show that news articles conveying a hyperpartisan world view can be distinguished from more balanced news by writing style alone.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Moreover, for the first time, we found quantifiable evidence that the writing styles of news of the two opposing orientations are in fact very similar: there appears to be a common writing style of left and right extremism.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We further show that satire can be distinguished well from other news, ensuring that humor will not be outcast by fake news detection technology.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"All of these results offer new, tangible, short-term avenues of development, lest large-scale fact-checking is still far out of reach.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Employed as pre-filtering technologies to separate hyperpartisan news from mainstream news, our approach allows for directing the attention of human fact checkers to the most likely sources of fake news.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"In this work, we propose a data-driven syntaxbased neural network model tailored for generation of general-purpose PLs like Python.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"ASTs can be deterministically generated for all well-formed programs using standard parsers provided by the PL, and thus give us a way to obtain syntax information with minimal engineering.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"The backbone of our approach is a grammar model (§ 3) which formalizes the generation story of a derivation AST into sequential application of actions that either apply production rules (§ 3.1), or emit terminal tokens (§ 3.2).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The underlying syntax of the PL is therefore encoded in the grammar model a priori as the set of possible actions.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

We define a probabilistic grammar model of generating an AST y given x: p(y|x).,2 The Code Generation Problem,[1.0],['We define a probabilistic grammar model of generating an AST y given x: p(y|x).']
"The best-possible AST ŷ is then given by
ŷ = arg max y
p(y|x).",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"(1)
ŷ is then deterministically converted to the corresponding surface code c.2",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"While this paper uses examples from Python code, our method is PLagnostic.
",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"Before detailing our approach, we first present a brief introduction of the Python AST and its underlying grammar.",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"The Python abstract grammar contains a set of production rules, and an AST is generated by applying several production rules composed of a head node and multiple child nodes.",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"For instance, the first rule in Tab. 1 is used to generate the function call sorted(·) in Fig. 1(a).",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"It consists of a head node of type Call, and three child nodes of type expr, expr* and keyword*, respectively.",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
Labels of each node are noted within brackets.,2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"In an AST, non-terminal nodes sketch the general structure of the target code, while terminal nodes can be categorized into two types: operation terminals and variable terminals.",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
Operation terminals correspond to basic arithmetic operations like AddOp.,2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
Variable terminal nodes store values for variables and constants of built-in data types3.,2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"For instance, all terminal nodes in Fig. 1(a) are variable terminal nodes.",2 The Code Generation Problem,[0],[0]
"Before detailing our neural code generation method, we first introduce the grammar model at its core.",3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
Our probabilistic grammar model defines the generative story of a derivation AST.,3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
"We fac-
2We use astor library to convert ASTs into Python code.",3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
"3bool, float, int, str.
torize the generation process of an AST into sequential application of actions of two types:
• APPLYRULE[r] applies a production rule r to the current derivation tree;
• GENTOKEN[v] populates a variable terminal node by appending a terminal token v.
Fig. 1(b) shows the generation process of the target AST in Fig. 1(a).",3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
Each node in Fig. 1(b) indicates an action.,3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
Action nodes are connected by solid arrows which depict the chronological order of the action flow.,3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
"The generation proceeds in depth-first, left-to-right order (dotted arrows represent parent feeding, explained in § 4.2.1).
",3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
"Formally, under our grammar model, the probability of generating an AST y is factorized as:
p(y|x)",3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
"= TY
t=1
p(at|x, a<t), (2)
where at is the action taken at time step t, and a<t is the sequence of actions before t. We will explain how to compute the action probabilities p(at|·) in Eq.",3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
"(2) in § 4. Put simply, the generation process begins from a root node at t0, and proceeds by the model choosing APPLYRULE actions to generate the overall program structure from a closed set of grammar rules, then at leaves of the tree corresponding to variable terminals, the model switches to GENTOKEN actions to generate variables or constants from the open set.",3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
We describe this process in detail below.,3 Grammar Model,[0],[0]
"APPLYRULE actions generate program structure, expanding the current node (the frontier node at
time step t: nft) in a depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the tree.",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
"Given a fixed set of production rules, APPLYRULE chooses a rule r from the subset that has a head matching the type of nft , and uses r to expand nft by appending all child nodes specified by the selected production.",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
"As an example, in Fig. 1(b), the rule Call 7! expr. . .",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
"expands the frontier node Call at time step t4, and its three child nodes expr, expr* and keyword* are added to the derivation.
",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
APPLYRULE actions grow the derivation AST by appending nodes.,3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
"When a variable terminal node (e.g., str) is added to the derivation and becomes the frontier node, the grammar model then switches to GENTOKEN actions to populate the variable terminal with tokens.
",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
"Unary Closure Sometimes, generating an AST requires applying a chain of unary productions.",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[1.0],"['Unary Closure Sometimes, generating an AST requires applying a chain of unary productions.']"
"For instance, it takes three time steps (t9 t11) to generate the sub-structure expr* 7! expr 7!",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
Name 7! str in Fig. 1(a).,3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
This can be effectively reduced to one step of APPLYRULE action by taking the closure of the chain of unary productions and merging them into a single rule: expr* 7!⇤ str.,3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
"Unary closures reduce the number of actions needed, but would potentially increase the size of the grammar.",3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
In our experiments we tested our model both with and without unary closures (§ 5).,3.1 APPLYRULE Actions,[0],[0]
"Once we reach a frontier node nft that corresponds to a variable type (e.g., str), GENTOKEN actions are used to fill this node with values.",3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[1.0],"['Once we reach a frontier node nft that corresponds to a variable type (e.g., str), GENTOKEN actions are used to fill this node with values.']"
"For generalpurpose PLs like Python, variables and constants have values with one or multiple tokens.",3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
"For in-
stance, a node that stores the name of a function (e.g., sorted) has a single token, while a node that denotes a string constant (e.g., a=‘hello world’) could have multiple tokens.",3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
Our model copes with both scenarios by firing GENTOKEN actions at one or more time steps.,3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
"At each time step, GENTOKEN appends one terminal token to the current frontier variable node.",3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
A special </n>,3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
token is used to “close” the node.,3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
"The grammar model then proceeds to the new frontier node.
",3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
"Terminal tokens can be generated from a predefined vocabulary, or be directly copied from the input NL.",3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
This is motivated by the observation that the input description often contains out-ofvocabulary (OOV) variable names or literal values that are directly used in the target code.,3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
"For instance, in our running example the variable name my list can be directly copied from the the input at t12.",3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
We give implementation details in § 4.2.2.,3.2 GENTOKEN Actions,[0],[0]
We estimate action probabilities in Eq.,4 Estimating Action Probabilities,[0],[0]
(2) using attentional neural encoder-decoder models with an information flow structured by the syntax trees.,4 Estimating Action Probabilities,[0],[0]
"For an NL description x consisting of n words {wi}ni=1, the encoder computes a context sensitive embedding hi for each wi using a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), similar to the setting in (Bahdanau et al., 2014).",4.1 Encoder,[0],[0]
See supplementary materials for detailed equations.,4.1 Encoder,[0],[0]
The decoder uses an RNN to model the sequential generation process of an AST defined as Eq.,4.2 Decoder,[0],[0]
(2).,4.2 Decoder,[0],[0]
Each action step in the grammar model naturally grounds to a time step in the decoder RNN.,4.2 Decoder,[1.0],['Each action step in the grammar model naturally grounds to a time step in the decoder RNN.']
"Therefore, the action sequence in Fig. 1(b) can be interpreted as unrolling RNN time steps, with solid arrows indicating RNN connections.",4.2 Decoder,[0],[0]
"The RNN maintains an internal state to track the generation process (§ 4.2.1), which will then be used to compute action probabilities p(at|x, a<t) (§ 4.2.2).",4.2 Decoder,[1.0],"['The RNN maintains an internal state to track the generation process (§ 4.2.1), which will then be used to compute action probabilities p(at|x, a<t) (§ 4.2.2).']"
"Our implementation of the decoder resembles a vanilla LSTM, with additional neural connections (parent feeding, Fig. 1(b)) to reflect the topological structure of an AST.",4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
"The decoder’s internal hidden state at time step t, st, is given by:

4.",4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, feeding the decoder the information of nft helps the model to keep track of the frontier node to expand.",4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
"Action Embedding at We maintain two action embedding matrices, WR and WG.",4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
Each row in WR (WG) corresponds to an embedding vector for an action APPLYRULE[r] (GENTOKEN[v]).,4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
Context Vector ct,4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]

We follow Bahdanau et al. (2014) and use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a single hidden layer to compute attention weights.,4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
Parent Feeding pt,4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
Our decoder RNN uses additional neural connections to directly pass information from parent actions.,4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
"For instance, when computing s9, the information from its parent action step t4 will be used.",4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]
"Formally, we define the parent action step pt as the time step at which the frontier node nft is generated.",4.2.1 Tracking Generation States,[0],[0]

"SEQ2TREE generates trees one node at a time, and the target grammar is not explicitly modeled a priori, but implicitly learned from data.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"We test both the original SEQ2TREE model released by the authors and our revised one (SEQ2TREE–UNK) that uses unknown word replacement to handle rare words (Luong et al., 2015).",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"For completeness, we also compare with a strong neural machine translation (NMT) system (Neubig, 2015) using a standard encoder-decoder architecture with attention and unknown word replacement9, and include numbers from other baselines used in Ling et al. (2016).",5.3 Results,[0],[0]

"System Comparison As in Tab. 3, our model registers 11.7% and 9.3% absolute improvements over LPN in accuracy on HS and DJANGO.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
This boost in performance strongly indicates the importance of modeling grammar in code generation.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"For the baselines, we find LPN outperforms NMT and SEQ2TREE in most cases.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"We also note that SEQ2TREE achieves a decent accuracy of 13.6% on HS, which is due to the effect of unknown word replacement, since we only achieved 1.5% without it.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"A closer comparison with SEQ2TREE is insightful for understanding the advantage of our syntax-driven approach, since both SEQ2TREE and our system output ASTs: (1) SEQ2TREE predicts one node each time step, and requires additional “dummy” nodes to mark the boundary of a subtree.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]

(3)).,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"This yields worse results on DJANGO while gives slight improvements in ac-
curacy on HS.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"This is probably because that the grammar of HS has fewer node types, and thus the RNN is able to keep track of nft without depending on its embedding.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"Next, “–parent feed.” removes the parent feeding mechanism.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"The accuracy drops significantly on HS, with a marginal deterioration on DJANGO.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"This result is interesting because it suggests that parent feeding is more important when the ASTs are larger, which will be the case when handling more complicated code generation tasks like HS.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"Finally, removing the pointer network (“–copy terminals”) in GENTOKEN actions gives poor results, indicating that it is important to directly copy variable names and values from the input.
",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"The results with and without unary closure demonstrate that, interestingly, it is effective on HS but not on DJANGO.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"We conjecture that this is because on HS it significantly reduces the number of actions from 173 to 142 (c.f., Tab. 2), with the number of productions in the grammar remaining unchanged.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"In contrast, DJANGO has a broader domain, and thus unary closure results in more productions in the grammar (237 for DJANGO vs. 100 for HS), increasing sparsity.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]

Domain Specific Code Generation,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"Although this is not the focus of our work, evaluation on IFTTT brings us closer to a standard semantic parsing set-

"This score is close to the best classical method (LR), which is based on a logistic regression model with rich hand-engineered features (e.g., brown clusters and paraphrase).",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
Also note that the performance between NMT and other neural models is much closer compared with the results in Tab. 3.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"This suggests that general-purpose code generation is more challenging than the simpler IFTTT setting, and therefore modeling structural information is more helpful.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
Case Studies,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
We present output examples in Tab. 5.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"On HS, we observe that most of the time our model gives correct predictions by filling learned code templates from training data with arguments (e.g., cost) copied from input.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
This is in line with the findings in Ling et al. (2016).,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"However, we do find interesting examples indicating that the model learns to generalize beyond trivial
copying.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"For instance, the first example is one that our model predicted wrong — it generated code block A instead of the gold B (it also missed a function definition not shown here).",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"However, we find that the block A actually conveys part of the input intent by destroying all, not some, of the minions.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"Since we are unable to find code block A in the training data, it is clear that the model has learned to generalize to some extent from multiple training card examples with similar semantics or structure.

We found that around 2% of these examples in the two datasets are actually semantically equivalent.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
These examples include: (1) using different parameter names when defining a function; (2) omitting (or adding) default values of parameters in function calls.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"While the rarity of such examples suggests that our exact match metric is reasonable, more advanced evaluation metrics based on statistical code analysis are definitely intriguing future work.

"Code Generation and Analysis Most works on code generation focus on generating code for domain specific languages (DSLs) (Kushman and
Barzilay, 2013; Raza et al., 2015; Manshadi et al., 2013), with neural network-based approaches recently explored (Liu et al., 2016; Parisotto et al., 2016; Balog et al., 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For general-purpose code generation, besides the general framework of Ling et al. (2016), existing methods often use language and task-specific rules and strategies (Lei et al., 2013; Raghothaman et al., 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"A similar line is to use NL queries for code retrieval (Wei et al., 2015; Allamanis et al., 2015).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The reverse task of generating NL summaries from source code has also been explored (Oda et al., 2015; Iyer et al., 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, our work falls into the broad field of probabilistic modeling of source code (Maddison and Tarlow, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2013).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our approach of factoring an AST using probabilistic models is closely related to Allamanis et al. (2015), which uses a factorized model to measure the semantic relatedness between NL and ASTs for code retrieval, while our model tackles the more challenging generation task.

"Semantic Parsing Our work is related to the general topic of semantic parsing, which aims to transform NL descriptions into executable logical forms.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
The target logical forms can be viewed as DSLs.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The parsing process is often guided by grammatical formalisms like combinatory categorical grammars (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Artzi et al., 2015), dependency-based syntax (Liang et al., 2011; Pasupat and Liang, 2015) or taskspecific formalisms (Clarke et al., 2010; Yih et al., 2015; Krishnamurthy et al., 2016; Mei et al., 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recently, there are efforts in designing neural network-based semantic parsers (Misra and Artzi, 2016; Dong and Lapata, 2016; Neelakantan et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Several approaches have be proposed to utilize grammar knowledge in a neural parser, such as augmenting the training data by generating examples guided by the grammar (Kociský et al., 2016; Jia and Liang, 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Liang et al. (2016) used a neural decoder which constrains the space of next valid tokens in the query language for question answering.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, the structured prediction approach proposed by Xiao et al. (2016) is closely related to our model in using the underlying grammar as prior knowledge to constrain the generation process of derivation trees, while our method is based on a unified grammar model which jointly captures production rule application and terminal symbol generation, and scales to general purpose code generation tasks.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
