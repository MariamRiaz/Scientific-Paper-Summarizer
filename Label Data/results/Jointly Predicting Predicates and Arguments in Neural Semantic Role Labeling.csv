"Recent high-performing SRL models (He et al., 2017; Marcheggiani et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018) are BIO-taggers, labeling argument spans for a single predicate at a time (as shown in Figure 1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"They are typically only evaluated with gold predicates, and must be pipelined with error-prone predicate identification models for deployment.

"The span representations also generalize the token-level representations in BIObased models, letting the model dynamically decide which spans and roles to include, without using previously standard syntactic features (Punyakanok et al., 2008; FitzGerald et al., 2015).
