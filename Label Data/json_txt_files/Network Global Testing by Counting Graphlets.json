Introduction", "text": "Given a large symmetrical network, we are interested in the global testing problem where we use the adjacency matrix of the network to test whether the network consists of only one community or that it consists of multiple communities, where some nodes may have mixed memberships.\nReal networks frequently have severe degree heterogeneity. The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is well-known, but does not accommodate severe degree heterogeneity. To tackle the problem, Karrer and Newman (2011) proposed the DegreeCorrected Block Model (DCBM). DCBM strikes a better balance between theory and practice than SBM, and has become increasingly more popular recently.\nWe adopt a Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM) model (Jin et al., 2017). DCMM can be viewed as an extension of DCBM, but allows for mixed memberships. Suppose the network has n nodes and K perceivable communities\nC1, C2, . . . , CK . *Equal contribution 1Department of Statistics and Data Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA 2Department of Statistics, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA.

We call node i \u201cpure\u201d if \u03c0i is degenerate and \u201cmixed\u201d otherwise. Let A \u2208 Rn,n be the adjacency matrix, where Aij = 1 if nodes i and j have an edge, and Aij = 0 otherwise (all diagonal entries of A are 0 as we don\u2019t treat a node as connecting to itself). In DCMM, we think the upper triangle of A contains independent Bernoulli random variables. Moreover, for n degree heterogeneity parameters \u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n and a non-singular, irreducible matrix P \u2208 RK,K ,\nP(Aij = 1) = \u03b8i\u03b8j K\u2211 k=1 K\u2211 `=1 \u03c0i(k)\u03c0j(`)Pk`. (1)\nAlso, we assume (a) all diagonals of P are 1, and (b) each of the K communities has at least one pure node. With such constraints, DCMM is identifiable (Jin et al., 2017).\nLet \u0398 be the n\u00d7 n diagonal matrix \u0398 = diag(\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8n) and let \u03a0 be the n\u00d7K matrix \u03a0 = [\u03c01, \u03c02, . . . , \u03c0n]\u2032. Let \u2126 = \u0398\u03a0P\u03a0\u2032\u0398 (recall that P \u2208 RK,K):\n\u2126 = \u03b81 . . . \u03b8n  \u03c0 \u2032 1 ... \u03c0\u2032n P [\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0n] \u03b81 . . . \u03b8n  . Let diag(\u2126) be the diagonal matrix where the i-th diagonal entry is \u2126ii, and let W = A\u2212 [\u2126\u2212 diag(\u2126)]. We have\nA = [\u2126\u2212 diag(\u2126)] +W = \u201csignal\u201d + \u201cnoise\u201d.\nRemark 1. Many recent works use the \u201cRandom Degree Parameter (RDP)\u201d model (which is narrower than ours): fixing a scaling parameter \u03b1n > 0 and a density function f over (0,\u221e) where the first a few moments of f are finite, and especially the second moment is 1, we assume (\u03b8i/\u03b1n)\niid\u223c f , i = 1, 2, . . . , n. We call the resultant DCMM model the DCMM-RDP model. In applications where we don\u2019t know how \u03b8i\u2019s are correlated, it is preferable to treat \u03b8 as nonrandom as before, and it is safer to use the original DCMM than DCMM-RDP.\nThe testing problem can be cast as testing a null hypothesis H\n(n) 0 against a specific hypothesis H (n) 1 in its complement:\nH (n) 0 : K = 1 vs. H (n) 1 : K > 1, (2)\nwhere under H(n)1 , DCMM holds for some eligible (P, \u03b81, ..., \u03b8n, \u03c01, ..., \u03c0n). Note that under H (n) 0 , P = 1, \u03c01, ..., \u03c0n are all degenerate, and P(A(i, j) = 1) = \u03b8i\u03b8j .\nMost existing literatures for the testing problem (2) have been focused on the special case where\n\u2022 No degree heterogeneity. \u03b81 = \u03b82 = . . . = \u03b8n. \u2022 No mixed-membership. All \u03c0i are degenerate PMFs.\nMany tests were proposed for this special case, including but are not limited to the likelihood ratio test approach (Wang & Bickel, 2017) and the spectral approach (Bickel & Sarkar, 2016; Lei, 2016; Banerjee & Ma, 2017).\nHowever, in our setting, \u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n vary significantly from one to another, and it is unclear how to extend the methods above to the current setting. The likelihood ratio test is not applicable, for there are many unknown parameters (\u03b81, \u03c01), (\u03b82, \u03c02), ..., (\u03b8n, \u03c0n). The spectral approach also faces challenges, because the distributions of such test statistics depend on unknown parameters in a complicated way, and it is nontrivial to figure out the rejection region.\nAlso, it may be tempting to adapt the recent approaches on estimating K to our testing problem (Saldana et al., 2017; Chen & Lei, 2017; Le & Levina, 2015), but similarly, due to severe degree heterogeneity, the null distributions of such statistics are not tractable, so they cannot be used directly.\nRecently, Gao and Lafferty (2017) (see also Bubeck et al. (2016) which is related but on different settings) proposed a new test called the Erdo\u030bs-Zuckerberg (EZ) test for DCMM, with the following constraints.\n\u2022 (GL1) No mixed-membership: all \u03c0i are degenerate. \u2022 (GL2) The community labels are uniformly drawn so\nthe K communities have roughly equal sizes.\n\u2022 (GL3) The DCMM-RDP holds (i.e., \u03b8i are iid samples), and the K \u00d7K matrix P has the special form of\nP = a b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 b... . . . ... b b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a  . Note that the last bullet point is particularly restrictive.\nGao and Lafferty (2017) made an interesting observation that the effect of the degree heterogeneity parameters \u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n is largely canceled out in the EZ test, and the test statistic approximately equals to 0 under the null, regardless of what \u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n are. This allows us to find a convenient way to map out the rejection region.\nUnfortunately, the authors did not make it clear whether the cancellation is \u201ccoincidental\u201d and is due to the symmetry they imposed on the model (see GL1-GL3), or is \u201cinherent\u201d and holds for much broader settings.\nIn this paper, we introduce a class of test statistics by counting the number of graphlets in the network. Fixing a small m \u2265 1, we count two kinds of graphlets: length-m paths and m-cycles. Our main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 Ideation. For a K-vector \u03b7 and a K \u00d7 K matrix G1/2PG1/2 to be introduced, we derive succinct proxies for the number of length-m paths and mcycles, using \u03b7 and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of G1/2PG1/2. The proxies motivate a systematic way of constructing tests where the degree heterogeneity is largely removed so the distributions are more tractable.\nTo the best of our knowledge, such proxies have not been discovered in the literature. \u2022 Methods and theory. We propose a class of graphlet count (GC) test statistics, and derive their asymptotic distributions, under the null and alternative hypotheses.\nWe try to be as general as possible, and our methods and theory are for DCMM with minimal constraints.\nThe way we construct our statistics is to use the proxies aforementioned, and thus is different from that in Gao and Lafferty (2017), which uses calculations that heavily depend on the imposed constraints GL1-GL3. See Section 3.2 for more comparison.\nOur findings support the philosophy of Jin (2015) which introduced the community detection algorithm SCORE. Jin (2015) pointed out that \u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n are required to model severe degree heterogeneity, but they turn out to be nuisance parameters, the effects of which can be largely removed with a proper construction of statistics.\nWhile our tests are designed for global testing, the idea is also useful for tackling other problems. For example, we can combine our idea with those in community detection (e.g. Jin (2015), Chen et al. (2018), Qin and Rohe (2013)) to estimate the number of communities K."}, {"heading": "2. A Class of Graphlet Count (GC) Statistics", "text": "The testing problem (2) is hard for there are so many unknown parameters: P, \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8n, \u03c01, . . . , \u03c0n. The parameters \u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n, which are required to model the severe degree heterogeneity of real networks, are especially hard to deal with for they vary significantly from one to another. What we need is therefore a smart test statistic that\n\u2022 does not vary significantly as \u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n)\u2032 varies, and has a tractable limiting distribution (so it is easy to map out the rejection region),\n\u2022 is powerful in differentiating the null and alternative.\nOur idea is to use the graphlet-count statistics. In a network, we say a path is a \u201cself-avoiding path\u201d if it doesn\u2019t intersect with itself, and a \u201ccycle\u201d if it is a closed path that does not intersect with itself.\nDefinition 2.1 For 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n, let Bn,m = \u220fm\u22121 s=0 (n\u2212 s).

Let 1n be the n-dimensional vector of 1\u2019s and let \u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n)\u2032. We use (\u00b7, \u00b7) to denote the inner product of two vectors. The K \u00d7K matrix G \u2261 \u03a0\u2032\u03982\u03a0 and the vector \u03b7 \u2208 RK play a key role.\nDefinition 2.3 Denote the vector G\u22121/2\u03a0\u2032\u03981n by \u03b7.\nDefinition 2.4 For 1 \u2264 k \u2264 K, let \u03bbk be the k-th largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of G1/2PG1/2, and let \u03bek be the corresponding eigenvector.\nIt turns out that \u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbK (eigenvalues of G1/2PG1/2) are the nonzero eigenvalues of \u2126. The following results, which will be made precise in Theorems 3.1-3.2, play the key role:\nnm \u00b7 C\u0302m \u2248 tr(\u2126m) = K\u2211 k=1 \u03bbmk , (4)\nnm+1 \u00b7 L\u0302m \u2248 1\u2032n\u2126m1n = K\u2211 k=1 (\u03b7, \u03bek) 2\u03bbmk . (5)\nWe explain why these equations motivate the test statistic \u03c7\u0302 (m) gc . Recall that we hope to have a statistic that does not vary too much as \u03b8 varies, so first, it is desirable to remove the terms (\u03b7, \u03bek)2, which not only depend on \u03b8 but are also not very tractable. Under the alternative hypothesis, it is unclear how to cancel these terms, but under the null hypothesis, K = 1, and the right hand side of (5) reduces to (\u03b7, \u03be1)\n2\u03bbm1 , and there are many ways to do the cancellation. One such way is to use the following ratio:\nnmL\u0302m\u22121 nm\u22121L\u0302m\u22122 \u2248 \u2211K k=1(\u03b7, \u03bek) 2\u03bbm\u22121k\u2211K k=1(\u03b7, \u03bek) 2\u03bbm\u22122k { = \u03bb1, under H (n) 0 ,\n\u2264 \u03bb1, under H(n)1 . (6)\nTherefore, at least under H(n)0 , we have managed to cancel the terms (\u03b7, \u03bek)2.\nNext, it is also desirable to cancel the term \u03bb1, at least under the null hypothesis. Comparing (4) and (6), there are many ways to do this, and one such way is to use the \u03c7\u0302(m)gc statistic aforementioned:\nnm\u03c7\u0302(m)gc = n mC\u0302m \u2212 [ ( nmL\u0302m\u22121)/(n m\u22121L\u0302m\u22122) ]m .\nIn fact, by (4) and (6), we have that up to a negligible term (i.e., of a smaller order than that of the standard deviation of the statistic under H(n)0 ),\n\u03c7\u0302(m)gc { = 0, under H(n)0 , \u2265 1nm \u2211K k=2 \u03bb m k , under H (n) 1 .\nOn the one hand, the effects of degree heterogeneity are largely canceled in the statistic, so it does not vary significantly as the vector \u03b8 varies (this is particularly important for we wish to have a rejection region that is relatively insensitive to \u03b8). On the other hand, the statistic \u03c7\u0302(m)gc is able to differentiate the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, through the term \u2211K k=2 \u03bb m k . This suggests that \u03c7\u0302 (m) gc is a reasonable test statistic.\nNote that \u03c7\u0302(m)gc is only one of many test statistics with the desired properties above, but seemingly one of the simplest.\nRemark 3. Recall that \u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbK are the eigenvalues of G1/2PG1/2, and they are also the eigenvalues of PG (nonnegative, irreducible). By Perron\u2019s theorem (Horn & Johnson, 1985), \u03bb1 is positive and \u03bb1 > |\u03bbk| for all 2 \u2264 k \u2264 K.\nRemark 4. Our tests include the EZ test as a special case (i.e., \u03c7\u0302(m)gc with m = 3), but our idea is by no means a straightforward extension of that in Gao and Lafferty (2017). The EZ test was derived by calculations that depend heavily on the constraints GL1-GL3 imposed on P , \u03b8, etc., and it was unclear whether the core idea of the EZ test is only valid when these constraints hold, or in more general settings. The GC tests are derived by (4)-(6), where the relationship between the test statistics and \u03b8, \u03b7, and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of G1/2PG1/2 has not been discovered before, even in cases where the constraints GL1-GL3 hold.\nRemark 5. Can we simply use \u2211K k=2 \u03bb\u0302 m k as the test statistic, where \u03bb\u0302k is the k-th eigenvalue of A? We can not, as K is unknown. Can we simply use \u03bb\u03022 as the test statistic? We can, but the asymptotic distribution of \u03bb\u03022 is much harder to derive than that of \u03c7\u0302(m)gc (which is Gaussian; see below), so it is challenging to determine the rejection region."}, {"heading": "3.

In fact, \u03b4(m)gc may be 0 under some H (n) 1 , even\nwhen signals are strong; see Section 3.3 for an example. If additionally P (and so G1/2PG1/2) is positive definite, then \u03b4(m)gc is positive, either m is odd or even.\nCorollary 3.1 Consider the DCMM model (1) where (7)- (9) hold and the Graphlet Count test (13). As n\u2192\u221e.\n\u2022 When m = 3, for some configurations of the non-null case, \u03b4(3)gc = 0 and the power of the test is \u03b1+ o(1).

In comparison, \u03c7\u0302(3)gc has a two-fold disadvantage: it may lose power in some non-null configurations even when \u2016\u03b8\u2016 is large, and as \u2016\u03b8\u2016 \u2192 \u221e, its power grows to 1 in a speed slower than that of \u03c7\u0302(4)gc .\nRemark 7. In the most subtle case where \u2016\u03b8\u2016 1, for any m \u2265 3, \u03c7\u0302(m)gc has a non-trivial power since the signal to noise ratio \u03b4(m)gc \u2016\u03b8\u2016m. The form is reminiscent of the results on likelihood ratio (Mossel et al., 2015) which is unfortunately only for SBM (much narrower than DCMM).\nRemark 8. The computational complexity of the GC test is O(nd2) for m = 3 and O(nd3) for m = 4 (Schank & Wagner, 2005), where d is the maximum degree. Many large networks are reasonably sparse where d n, and the complexity is reasonably modest in such cases.\nRemark 9. Our work is connected to Maugis et al. (2017), which characterizes the expected number of closed walks. However, their work does not study the expected number non-closed walks, and the standard deviations of close and non-closed walks, so how to apply their results to our setting is unclear. Our work is also closed to the notion of clustering coefficient (Holland & Leinhardt, 1971; Watts & Strogatz, 1998), which in our notation equals to 3C\u03023/L\u03022. To use this as a test, the challenge is how to normalize the statistic properly so the limiting distribution is more tractable. Also, the test may lose power in some settings. In Section 3.3, we provide an example where C3/L2 = \u03bb1 + ( \u2211K k=2 \u03bb 3 k)/\u03bb 2 1,\nso when \u2211K k=2 \u03bb 3 k = 0, asymptotically, the test is powerless while the GC test may still have good power."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Furthermore, we have proved \u2016\u03b8\u20163 \u2264 \u2016\u03b8\u201624\u2016\u03b8\u20161. Combining the above gives \u2016\u03b8\u20161\u2016\u03b8\u201633\u2016\u03b8\u20162 \u2264 \u2016\u03b8\u201621\u2016\u03b8\u201644. Hence, the second term is dominated by the last term. In summary, the remainder term is O(\u2016\u03b8\u201621\u2016\u03b8\u201644\u2016\u03b8\u20162(m\u22123)). This proves (17).\nNext, we use (16)-(17) to show the claim.

By definition and (18)-(19),\nBn,m\u03c7 (m) gc,0 = C\u0303 0 m \u2212 (L\u03030m\u22121/L\u03030m\u22122)m,\nBn,m\u03c7 (m) gc = Bn,m[Cm \u2212 (Lm\u22121/Lm\u22122)m]\n= C\u0303m \u2212 (Bn,m\u22121) m\n(Bn,m)m\u22121 \u00b7 (L\u0303m\u22121/L\u0303m\u22122)m.\nAs a result,\nBn,m|\u03c7(m)gc \u2212 \u03c7 (m) gc,0| \u2264 |C\u0303m \u2212 C\u03030m|+ \u2223\u2223\u2223 (L\u0303m\u22121)m (L\u0303m\u22122)m \u2212 (L\u0303 0 m\u22121) m (L\u03030m\u22122) m \u2223\u2223\u2223 + (L\u0303m\u22121) m\n(L\u0303m\u22122)m \u2223\u2223\u2223 (Bn,m\u22121)m(Bn,m)m\u22121 \u2212 1\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2261 I1 + I2 + I3. (20)\nWe now bound these three terms. By (16)-(17),\n|C\u0303m \u2212 C\u03030m| = O(\u2016\u03b8\u201644\u2016\u03b8\u20162m\u22124), |L\u0303m \u2212 L\u03030m| = O(\u2016\u03b8\u201621\u2016\u03b8\u201644\u2016\u03b8\u20162m\u22126). (21)\nHence, I1 = O(\u2016\u03b8\u201644\u2016\u03b8\u20162m\u22124).\nTo bound I2, we need the following lemma, which is proved in the supplemental material.\nLemma 6.1 Under conditions of Theorem 3.3, |\u03bbk| \u2016\u03b8\u20162 for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 K, and max1\u2264k\u2264K |\u03b7\u2032\u03bek| \u2016\u03b8\u2016\u22121\u2016\u03b8\u20161.\nBy (19), L\u03030m = \u2211 k(\u03b7 \u2032\u03bek)\n2\u03bbmk . For m even, it then follows from Lemma 6.1 that\nL\u03030m \u2265 c\u2016\u03b8\u20162m\u22122\u2016\u03b8\u201621 (22)\nfor a constant c > 0. For m odd, this is still true; see the proof of Lemma B.1 in the supplemental material. Additionally, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, \u2016\u03b8\u20164 \u2264 n\u2016\u03b8\u201644; hence, for m \u2264 3, |L\u0303m \u2212 L\u03030m| is negligible compared to the order of L\u03030m, so we also have L\u0303m \u2265 c\u2016\u03b8\u20162m\u22122\u2016\u03b8\u201621.

We discover a systematic way to cancel the effects of degree heterogeneity, and propose a family of tests, with careful analysis and numerical support. Compared to literature, our tests have competitive powers and are applicable in much broader settings. Our theory is also for very broad settings where existing works have very limited understanding. We point out an unappealing feature of the EZ test (Gao & Lafferty, 2017), and shows a new test in our family has successfully overcome the problem that the EZ test faces.\nIn our theorems, we require K to be fixed, but the results continue to hold if K \u2192 \u221e reasonably slowly.
