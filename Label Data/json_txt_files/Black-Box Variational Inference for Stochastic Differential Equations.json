Introduction", "text": "A stochastic differential equation (SDE) defines a diffusion process, which evolves randomly over time, by describing its instantaneous behaviour. As such, SDEs are powerful modelling tools used extensively in fields such as econometrics (Black & Scholes, 1973; Eraker, 2001), biology (Gillespie, 2000; Golightly & Wilkinson, 2011), physics (van Kampen, 2007) and epidemiology (Fuchs, 2013).\nIt is only possible to work with analytic solutions to SDEs in special cases. Therefore it is common to use a numerical approximation, such as the Euler-Maruyama scheme. Here the diffusion process is defined only on a grid of time points, and the transition density between successive diffusion states is approximated as Gaussian.

The difficulty is that, along with unknown parameters \u03b8 in the description of the SDE, there is an unknown latent path of the diffusion process, x. An inference method must somehow deal with these high dimensional, highly structured latent variables.\nOur proposed method uses recent advances in variational inference to jointly infer \u03b8 and x. We introduce a flexible family of approximations to the posterior distribution and select the member closest to the true posterior. We use a standard mean-field approximation for the \u03b8 posterior, and introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) approximation for the posterior of x conditional on \u03b8. The RNN learns how to supply Gaussian state transitions between successive time points which closely match those for the intractable conditioned diffusion process.\nOur black-box variational inference method is a simple and fast way to produce approximate inference for any SDE system. We illustrate our method on Lotka-Volterra and epidemic examples, achieving accurate parameter estimates in just a few hours under default tuning choices. Although our parameter posteriors are over-concentrated, as in most variational methods, our approximation of the conditioned diffusion process is close to the true posterior. In comparison, existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (see Section 1.1) require more tuning choices and can take days to run (Whitaker et al., 2017a)."}, {"heading": "1.1. Related Work", "text": "Variational inference Several authors have looked at variational inference for SDEs (Archambeau et al., 2008) or related problems such as Markov jump processes (Ruttor et al., 2010) and state space models (Archer et al., 2016; Quiroz et al., 2018). The novelty of our approach is to use: (1) stochastic optimisation rather than variational calculus; (2) a RNN-based variational approximation for the latent states instead of a mean-field or multivariate Gaussian approach. We expect (2) is especially relevant to sparsely observed SDEs, where the latent states between observations may have a particularly complex dependency structure.\nAnother approach (Moreno et al., 2016) is to perform vari-\national inference for the parameters only, using latent variables drawn from their prior in the ELBO estimate. Such latent states are typically a poor match to the observed data and so make a negligible contribution to the ELBO. To deal with the problem, close matches are upweighted. Our approach avoids this extra approximation by instead learning the posterior distribution of the latent variables.\nOur method can also be related to recent work on normalising flows as variational approximations (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015). As in that work, our variational approximation can be viewed as transforming a N(0, I) sample vector by successive linear transformations to an approximate posterior sample (of the diffusion states in our case). Our work uses SDE theory to select simple and cheap transformations which produce a particularly good approximation.\nMonte Carlo A popular approach in the Monte Carlo literature on SDEs is to introduce a bridge construct: an approximation to the discretised diffusion process conditional on the parameters and observations at a single time, derived using probability theory and various simplifying approximations. The goal is to produce a path bridging between two observation times. Combining successive bridges forms a complete diffusion path. Bridge constructs can be used to produce proposals within Monte Carlo algorithms such as MCMC (see e.g. Roberts & Stramer 2001; Golightly & Wilkinson 2008; Fuchs 2013; van der Meulen et al. 2017). However, designing a bridge construct with desirable features for a particular problem is a challenging and time consuming tuning choice. (Some particularly difficult regimes for bridge constructs are discussed in Section 5.) From this point of view, our contribution is to use machine learning to effectively automate the design of a bridge construct.\nAnother Monte Carlo approach is to perform approximate inference based on low dimensional summary statistics of the observations (Picchini, 2014). This results in a loss of information, which our approach avoids."}, {"heading": "2. Stochastic Differential Equations", "text": "Consider an Ito\u0302 process {Xt, t \u2265 0} satisfying the SDE\ndXt = \u03b1(Xt, \u03b8)dt+ \u221a \u03b2(Xt, \u03b8)dWt, X0 = x0. (1)\nHere Xt is a p-dimensional vector of random variables, \u03b1 is a p-dimensional drift vector, \u03b2 is a p\u00d7 p positive definite diffusion matrix (with \u221a \u03b2 representing a matrix square root) and Wt is a p-vector of standard and uncorrelated Brownian motion processes. The drift and diffusion depend on \u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82, ..., \u03b8c)\n\u2032, a vector of unknown parameters (which may also include the initial condition x0).\nWe assume that \u03b1(\u00b7) and \u03b2(\u00b7) are sufficiently regular that (1) has a weak non-explosive solution (\u00d8ksendal, 2003). In\nthis case, (1) defines a diffusion process. Such processes are always Markovian (i.e. memoryless).\nWe further assume partial noisy observations of the latent process. Suppose that there are d + 1 observation times t0, t1, . . . , td = T . In the simplest case, these times are equally spaced, separated by a time-step of \u2206t. Let ytj be a vector of p0 observations at time tj , for some p0 \u2264 p. Following Golightly & Wilkinson (2008), among others, we assume that\nytj = F \u2032Xtj + \u03c9tj , \u03c9tj indep\u223c N(0,\u03a3), (2)\nwhere F is a constant p\u00d7p0 matrix, and \u03a3 is a p0\u00d7p0 matrix which may be assumed known or the object of inference. For the latter case \u03a3 should be a specified function of \u03b8.\nUpon choosing a prior density p(\u03b8), Bayesian inference proceeds via the parameter posterior p(\u03b8|y), or alternatively the joint posterior p(\u03b8, x|y).\nDiscretisation Few SDEs permit analytical solutions to (1) and instead it is common to use an approximation based on time discretisation. We therefore introduce intermediate time-points between observation times. For concreteness, we present our methods for the case of equally spaced observations with t0 = 0. (It is easy to adapt them to alternative specifications of time points, such as those required by irregularly-spaced observation times.) We introduce k \u2212 1 time-points between successive observations, giving a regular grid of times \u03c4i = i\u2206\u03c4 for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,m = dk, with time-step \u2206\u03c4 = \u2206t/k. Note that i = 0, k, 2k, . . . , dk give the observation times. The role of k is to ensure the discretisation can be made arbitrarily accurate, at the expense of increased computational cost.\nWe work with the simplest discretisation, the EulerMaruyama scheme, in which transition densities between states at successive times are approximated as Gaussian\np ( x\u03c4i+1 |x\u03c4i , \u03b8 ) = \u03d5 ( x\u03c4i+1 \u2212 x\u03c4i ; \u03b1(x\u03c4i , \u03b8)\u2206\u03c4, \u03b2(x\u03c4i , \u03b8)\u2206\u03c4 ) ,\n(3)\nwhere \u03d5(\u00b7;\u00b5, S) is the Gaussian density with mean \u00b5 and variance matrix S. A generative expression of this is\nx\u03c4i+1 = x\u03c4i + \u03b1(x\u03c4i , \u03b8)\u2206\u03c4 + \u221a \u03b2(x\u03c4i , \u03b8)\u2206\u03c4 zi+1, (4)\nwhere zi+1 is an independent N(0, Ip) realisation.\nDiscretisation is not guaranteed to preserve properties of the underlying SDE. An issue which is particularly relevant later is positivity. In many SDEs, such as population models, it is guaranteed that some components of Xt are always positive. However, in (4) x\u03c4i+1 is sampled from a Gaussian, which has unbounded support. Consequently, there is a non-zero probability of sampling negative values. This is problematic\nas the drift or diffusion function may be poorly behaved or undefined for such input. A simple solution to this problem is the use of a reflecting boundary (Skorokhod, 1961), for example by projecting invalid x\u03c4i+1 values back to the valid region (Dangerfield et al., 2012).\nPosterior The joint posterior under the Euler-Maruyama discretisation is\np(\u03b8, x|y) \u221d p(\u03b8)p(x|\u03b8)p(y|x, \u03b8), (5)\np(x|\u03b8) = m\u22121\u220f i=0 \u03d5 ( x\u03c4i+1 \u2212 x\u03c4i ; \u03b1(x\u03c4i , \u03b8)\u2206\u03c4,\n\u03b2(x\u03c4i , \u03b8)\u2206\u03c4 ) (6)\np(y|x, \u03b8) = d\u220f i=0 \u03d5 (yti ;F \u2032xti ,\u03a3) . (7)\nIn principle Monte Carlo algorithms can sample from (5). However this is difficult in practice due to its high dimension and complex dependency structure.\nConditioned processes Consider the process defined by conditioning (1) on an initial state, x0 and an exactly observed future state, xt1 . This conditioned process itself satisfies an SDE (see e.g. Rogers & Williams, 2013) with drift and diffusion\n\u03b1\u0302(xt, \u03b8) = \u03b1(xt, \u03b8) + \u03b2(xt, \u03b8)\u2207xt log \u03c0 (xt1 |xt, \u03b8) , (8)\n\u03b2\u0302(xt, \u03b8) = \u03b2(xt, \u03b8), (9)\nwhere \u03c0 (xt1 |xt, \u03b8) is the transition density of the unconditioned process. While this is intractable in most cases, the result motivates our choice of variational approximation later.\nIn some simple situations a discretised approximation of this conditioned process can be derived (see e.g. Papaspiliopoulos et al. 2013) in which the diffusion matrix is scaled down as the observation time is approached. Intuitively this is appealing: conditioned paths converge towards the observation, so nearby random deviations are smaller in scale. This motivates us to use a variational approximation in which the diffusion matrix is not constrained to follow (9), and instead is allowed to shrink."}, {"heading": "3.

Optimisation is then used to find \u03c6 minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(q(\u03b8;\u03c6)||p(\u03b8|y)). This is equivalent to maximising the ELBO (evidence lower bound) (Jordan et al., 1999),\nE\u03b8\u223cq(\u00b7;\u03c6)[log p(\u03b8, y)\u2212 log q(\u03b8;\u03c6)].

This is typically overconcentrated, unless the approximating family is rich enough to allow particularly close matches to the posterior.\nThe optimisation required by VI can be performed efficiently using the reparameterisation trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Titsias & La\u0301zaro-Gredilla, 2014). This requires expressing \u03b8 \u223c q(\u00b7;\u03c6) as a non-centred parameterisation (Papaspiliopoulos et al., 2003). That is, writing \u03b8 as the output of an invertible deterministic function g( , \u03c6) for some random variable with a fixed distribution.

For each example we train our variational approximation until convergence (assessed manually throughout this paper), which takes roughly 20 minutes for the first 3 examples, and 90 minutes for the last. We then perform importance sampling using 500,000 samples from the fitted approximation. Table 1 shows the resulting ESS values. The first 3 rows in the table are typical observations under the model given our \u03b8, while the final row represents highly unlikely observations (double those in the previous row). Figure 1 shows fitted diffusion paths for this case.\nThis example contains several challenging features: all those listed at the start of Section 5 except (C). While these features make it hard to use existing bridge constructs, our variational method produces a close approximation to the true posterior, as illustrated by the high ESS values.\nThe case of highly unlikely observations takes longer to train and receives a lower ESS, reflecting that a more complicated diffusion path must be learned here. (To check this we found that a simpler RNN cell suffices for good performance in the other examples but not this one.)\nMultiple observation times with known parameters We now extend the previous example to multiple observation times, t = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40. We analyse synthetic data, produced using the parameters specified previously (including observation noise with \u03a3 = I). Here convergence takes 6 hours, and importance sampling with 500,000 samples produces an ESS of 96,812. The resulting diffusion\npaths are not shown as they are very similar visually to the next example (see Figure 2).\nThis example shows that our method learns the conditioned process well even when there are several observation times.\nMultiple observation times with unknown parameters We now analyse the same synthetic data with unknown \u03b8 parameters. As these must take positive values, we work with the log-transformed parameters \u03d1 and assume they have independent N(0, 32) priors. Our results are shown after transforming back to the original parameterisation.\nConvergence takes 2 hours, and importance sampling with 500,000 iterations produces an ESS of 635.4. Figure 2 shows 50 diffusion paths sampled from the fitted variational approximation. Figure 3 shows two estimates of the marginal parameter posteriors: the variational inference output, and a kernel density estimate based on importance sampling results.\nThe estimated posteriors give accurate estimates of the true parameter values. However, the low ESS here shows that both estimates of the parameter posteriors are imperfect approximations (also illustrated by the variational posterior estimates appearing overconcentrated compared to the importance sampling results.) Achieving good point estimates but imperfect posteriors is typical for variational inference (Blei et al., 2017)."}, {"heading": "5.2. Epidemic Model", "text": "An SIR epidemic model (Andersson & Britton, 2000) describes the spread of an infectious disease. The population is\nsplit into those susceptible (S), infectious (I) and removed (R). Two types of event take place: susceptibles can be infected by the infectious, and the infectious eventually become removed. Constant population size is assumed. Hence only the S and I population sizes need to be modelled.\nAn SIR epidemic model using SDEs is defined by\n\u03b1(Xt, \u03b8) =\n( \u2212\u03b81StIt\n\u03b81StIt \u2212 \u03b82It,\n) (25)\n\u03b2(Xt, \u03b8) = ( \u03b81StIt \u2212\u03b81StIt \u2212\u03b81StIt \u03b81StIt + \u03b82It ) , (26)\nwhere Xt = (St, It)\u2032 is the state of the system at time t, \u03b81 is an infection parameter and \u03b82 is a removal parameter. For a detailed derivation see Fuchs (2013).\nOur data is taken from an outbreak of influenza at a boys boarding school in 1978 (Jackson et al., 2013). Influenza was introduced to the population by a student returning from holiday in Hong Kong. Of the 763 boys at the school, 512 were infected within 14 days. Hence we assume x0 = (762, 1)\n\u2032. Observations of the number infectious are provided daily by those students confined to bed. We\nassume Gaussian observation error with unknown variance \u03c32. Our analyses use a discretisation time step of \u2206\u03c4 = 0.1.\nWe also consider an alternative model with a time-varying infection parameter. Here we let \u03d11 = log \u03b81 follow an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\nd\u03d1t,1 = \u03b83 (\u03b84 \u2212 \u03d1t,1) dt+ \u03b85dWt, (27)\nwhere \u03b83, \u03b84 and \u03b85 are the mean-reversion rate, process mean and volatility, respectively, and \u03b8t,1 is the infection parameter at time t. Previous related work has focused on ODE epidemic models with time-varying parameters following SDEs (Dureau et al., 2013; Del Moral & Murray, 2015). In contrast, our approach can easily be applied to a full SDE system.\nTime-invariant infection parameter We infer the logtransformed parameters \u03d1 = (log \u03b81, log \u03b82, log \u03c32)\u2032 under independent N(0, 32) priors. Our results are shown after transforming back to the original parameterisation.\nConvergence takes 2.5 hours, and importance sampling with 500,000 iterations produces an ESS of 718.2. Figure 4 shows two estimates of the marginal parameter posteriors: variational inference output, and a kernel density estimate based on importance sampling results. Figure 6 shows 50 diffusion paths sampled from the variational approximation.\nThe small ESS indicates there is some approximation error. However, the marginal posteriors for \u03b81 and \u03b82 are very similar to those from the MCMC analysis of Fuchs (2013, pg 293), despite some modelling differences (that analysis fixed \u03c32 = 0 and used exponential priors for \u03b81 and \u03b82).\nTime-variant infection parameter We infer the logtransformed parameters \u03d1 = (log \u03b80,1, log \u03b82, log \u03b83, log \u03b84, log \u03b85, log \u03c3\n2)\u2032 under independent N(0, 32) priors. Results are shown after transforming back to the original parameterisation.\nConvergence now takes 3 hours, and 500,000 iterations of importance sampling produces an ESS of 256.1. Figure 5 shows estimates of the marginal parameter posteriors, using variational inference and importance sampling outputs as before. Figures 7 (SIR) and 8 (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) show 50 diffusion paths sampled from the variational approximation. Again the low ESS indicates some approximation error.\nModel comparison The two models produce visually similar diffusion paths, but close inspection shows some differences. The time-invariant model paths for It appear smooth but slightly miss some of the observation points. The time-variant model paths for It are less smooth and more accurately capture the shape of the data. Correspondingly, the time-varying model infers a smaller \u03c32 value. The most obvious difference in It paths occurs for the t = 7, 8, 9\nobservations, shown in the zoomed-in inset of Figures 6 and 7. Figure 8 shows that shortly before this the time-variant \u03b81 values become constrained to smaller values.\nAlthough the time-varying model appears to fit the data better, this is at the cost of increased model complexity, and could simply reflect overfitting. A better estimate of the parameter posteriors would allow formal model comparison based on importance sampling evidence estimates."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "We provide a black-box variational approach to inference for SDES which is simple, practical and fast (relative to existing methods). This performs inference for a broad class of SDEs with minimal tuning requirements. Empirical investigation shows we obtain close matches to the posterior of the conditioned diffusion paths. Approximate parameter inference is also possible, with our results recovering known parameters for synthetic data (Section 5.1), and previous results for real data (Section 5.2), using only a few hours of computation for a desktop PC. An interesting future direction is develop choices of q(x|\u03b8;\u03c6x) more efficent than standard RNNs, to further reduce computing time and enable real-time applications of this methodology."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Tom Ryder is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Centre for Doctoral Training in Cloud Computing for Big Data (grant number EP/L015358/1).\nWe acknowledge with thanks an NVIDIA academic GPU grant for this project."}], "year": 2018, "references": [{"title": "Stochastic Epidemic Models and Their Statistical Analysis", "authors": ["H.
