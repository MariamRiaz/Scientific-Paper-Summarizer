0	26	The development of digital photography has led to the advancement of digital image editing, where professionals as well as hobbyists use software tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Photos, and so forth, to change and improve certain characteristics (brightness, contrast, etc.)
2	38	(2) The task is time consuming, and requires patience and experimenting with various features before settling on the final image edit.
3	38	(3) Sometimes users know at an abstract level what changes they want but are unaware of the image editing steps and parameters that will result in the desired image.
9	50	These web services include two types of users: expert editors who know how to edit the photographs, and novice users who post their photographs and request changes to be made.
15	24	In this setup the users can benefit greatly from conversing with an expert image editor in real time who can understand the requests, perform the editing, and provide feedback or suggestions as the editing is being performed.
17	53	Conversational image editing is a task particularly well suited for incremental dialogue processing.
21	30	The changes should occur as soon as the user has uttered “more” and continue happening while the user keeps saying “more, more”.
92	57	Each utterance segment was then assigned a dialogue act.
94	32	The inter-annotator agreement was measured by having our two annotators annotate the same dialogue session of 20 min, and kappa was found to be 0.81 which indicates high agreement.
99	28	IER-N requests refer to utterances that are concerned with new image edit requests different from the previously requested edits.
138	26	For our experiments we use a training set sampled randomly from 90% of the users (116 dialogues for training, 13 dialogues for testing).
141	35	We convert the words into vector representations to train our deep learning models (and a variation of the random forests).
144	32	As we can see in Table 4, for models E (LSTMs) and I (CNNs) we use word embeddings trained with fastText on the aforementioned data sets.
171	40	While from this example it is clear that the correct dialogue act can be identified before the user completes the utterance, it is not clear when to commit to a dialogue act.
175	68	In this example for the utterance “I think that’s good enough”, we feed the classifier the utterances one word at a time and get the classifier confidence.
176	40	The class label with the highest score is obtained.
177	101	Here the oracle tells us that we could predict the correct class COM-L as soon as “I think that’s good” was uttered and thus the word savings would be 1 word.
178	25	However, in real-world scenarios the oracle is not present.
180	85	For the predictions in the test set we get the accuracy for each of the thresholds.
182	24	Thus Figure 3 shows the word savings for each confidence threshold when the predictions are correct for that threshold.
183	40	So in the example of Table 6, for a confidence threshold value of 0.4, we extract the class label assigned for the utterance once the max confidence score exceeds 0.4.
184	24	In this case once the word “good” was uttered by the user the confidence score assigned (0.5) was higher than the threshold value of 0.4 and we take the predicted class as COM-L.
186	206	But for a confidence threshold value of 0.2, our prediction would be the tag O which would be wrong and there would be no time savings.
187	24	Figure 3 shows that as the confidence threshold values increase the accuracy of the predictions rises but the savings decrease.
188	83	Researchers have used simulations (Paetzel et al., 2015) or a reinforcement learning policy (Manuvinakurike et al., 2017) to learn the right points of interrupting the user which are dependent on the language understanding confidence scores.
191	47	We presented “conversational image editing”, a novel real-world application domain, which combines dialogue, visual information, and the use of computer vision.
192	34	We discussed why this is a domain particularly well suited for incremental dialogue processing.
193	25	We built models for incremental intent identification based on deep learning and traditional classification algorithms.
194	85	We calculated the impact of varying confidence thresholds (above which the classifier’s prediction is considered) on classification accuracy and savings in terms of number of words.
195	51	Our experiments provided evidence that incremental intent processing could be more efficient for the user and save time in accomplishing tasks.
