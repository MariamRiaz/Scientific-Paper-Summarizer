2	22	Geolocation prediction is one such analytical method that has been studied widely to predict a user location or a document location.
8	88	Secondly, tweets include metadata such as timezones and self-declared locations that can facilitate geolocation prediction.
9	25	Thirdly, a user network is obtainable by consideration of the interaction between two users as a network link.
10	17	Herein, we propose a neural network model to tackle geolocation prediction in Twitter.
11	36	Past studies have combined text, metadata, and user network information with ensemble approaches (Han et al., 2013, 2014; Rahimi et al., 2015a; Jayasinghe et al., 2016) to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
12	92	Our model combines text, metadata, and user network information using a complex neural network.
59	22	The component consists of a recurrent neural network (RNN) (Graves, 2012) layer and attention layers.
79	15	Figure 3 presents an overview of the user network component.
83	17	Linked cities and linked users are assigned with city embeddings c and user embeddings a respectively.
85	17	p is then passed to the subsequent attention layer AttentionN to obtain a user network representation as in AttentionU.
106	15	We construct mention networks (Jurgens, 2013; Compton et al., 2014; Rahimi et al., 2015a,b) from datasets as user networks.
109	19	The number of unidirectional mention edges for TwitterUS and WNUT can be found in Table 1.
111	17	We restricted edges to satisfy one of the following conditions to reduce the size: (1) both users have ground truth locations or (2) one user has a ground truth location and another user is mentioned 5 times or more in a training set.
122	12	LR-STACK is an ensemble learning model that combines four LR classifiers (LR-MSG, LR-LOC, LR-DESC, LR-TZ) with an l2-regularized logistic regression meta-classifier (LR-2ND).
127	31	LR-STACK results are introduced as dongle nodes to MAD instead of LR results to combine text, metadata, and network information.
139	13	We chose optimal values for these parameters in terms of accuracy with a grid search using the development sets of TwitterUS and W-NUT.
141	65	We evaluate the models in the following four commonly used metrics in geolocation prediction: accuracy the percentage of correctly predicted cities, accuracy@161 a relaxed accuracy that takes prediction errors within 161 km as correct predictions, median error distance median value of error distances in predictions, and mean error distance mean value of error distances in predictions.
151	55	Three of our models also improved in terms of accuracy.
154	26	The baseline model LR-STACK performed 4.5 km significantly better than our model.
155	15	Performance on W-NUT Table 3 presents the results of our models and the implemented baseline models on W-NUT.
157	30	We tested the significance of these results in the same way as we did for TwitterUS.
160	17	The accuracy is 3.8% higher against the previously reported best value (Jayasinghe et al., 2016) which combined texts, metadata, and user network information with an ensemble method.
164	13	Figure 4 presents the estimated probability density functions (PDFs) of the four input representations for AttentionU.
171	18	This finding is intuitive because TwitterUS has substantially more user network edges (reduced-edge/user in Table 1) than W-NUT, which is likely to benefit more from user network information.
182	34	One exception we found was the median distance error between SUB-NN-META and LR-STACKING in TwitterUS.
192	15	The first is a case when a location field is incorrect due to a reason such as a house move.
197	17	The architecture only supports single location field which disables the model to track location changes.
198	26	The architecture also treats each tweet independently which forbids the model to express a temporal state like traveling.
205	18	In these analyses, metadata like location fields and timezones may not be effective like in geolocation prediction.
206	22	However, a user network is known to include various user attributes information including gender and age (McPherson et al., 2001) which suggests the unification of text and user network information to result in a success as in geolocation prediction.
