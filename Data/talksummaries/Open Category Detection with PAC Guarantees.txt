12	8	Is it possible to achieve open category detection with guarantees?
16	7	At test time, a new sample will include insects from the training categories along with some percentage of insects from new alien categories.
18	47	We would like to guarantee that the system is able to raise an alarm for, say, 95% of the insects from alien classes, with each alarm being examined by a scientist.
22	17	In particular, we give an algorithm that uses this knowledge to provide Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees for achieving a user-specified alien detection rate.
23	11	While knowledge of a non-trivial upper bound on α may not always be possible, in many situations it will be possible to select a reasonable value based on domain knowledge, prior data, or by inspecting a sample of the test data.
27	11	The quality of the detector, however, has a significant impact on the false alarm rate, with better detectors leading to fewer false alarms.
33	20	Overall, our results provide a useful baseline for driving future work on open category detection with guarantees.
56	6	from a mixture dis- tribution Dm.
58	10	We assume that Da is stationary, so that all alien points that appear as future test queries will also be drawn from Da.
68	11	Our key challenge is to select a threshold that provides a guarantee on the alien detection rate.
70	12	Later, we will show that knowing an upper bound on α is sufficient to obtain a guarantee.
71	15	Our approach is based on considering the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) over anomaly scores of a fixed anomaly detector.
72	73	Let F0, Fa, and Fm be the CDFs of anomaly scores for the nominal data distribution D0, alien distribution Da, and mixture distribution Dm respectively.
74	22	From this we can derive the CDF for Fa in terms of Fm and F0: Fa(x) = Fm(x)− (1− α)F0(x) α .
76	13	In reality, we do not have access to Fm or F0 and hence cannot exactly determine Fa.
77	5	Rather, we have samples Sm and S0.
86	7	Although F̂m and F̂0 are both legal CDFs, the estimate for F̂a from step 3 may not be a legal CDF, because it is the difference of two noisy estimates—it may not increase monotonically and it may even be negative.
87	5	A good technique for dealing with this problem is to employ isotonization (Barlow & Brunk, 1972) and clipping.
89	11	To convert F̂a into a legal CDF, define F̌a = min{max{F̂ ∗a ,0},1}, where the min and max operators are applied pointwise to their arguments.
90	11	We performed experiments (shown in the supplementary materials) to test whether using F̌a in Step 4 would improve the performance of the overall algorithm.
92	19	In this section, we consider the finite data case where |S0| = |Sm| = n. We derive a value for the sample size n that guarantees with high probability over random draws of S0 and Sm, that fraction 1 − q − of the alien test points will be detected, where is an additional error incurred because of the finite sample size n. Our key theoretical tool is a finite sample result on the uniform convergence of empirical CDF functions (Massart, 1990).
96	47	The following theorem gives the sample complexity for guaranteeing that 1 − η of the alien examples will be detected using threshold τ̂q .
97	35	Let S0 and Sm be nominal and mixture datasets containing n i.i.d.
98	87	samples from the nominal and mixture data distributions respectively.
99	14	For any ∈ (0, 1−q) and δ ∈ (0, 1), if n > 1 2 ln 2 1− √ 1− δ ( 1 )2 ( 2− α α )2 , then with probability at least 1− δ, Algorithm 1 will return a threshold τ̂q that achieves an alien detection rate of at least 1− η, where η = q + .
100	38	Note that n grows as O( 1 2α2 log 1 δ ).
101	52	Hence, this guarantee is polynomial in all relevant parameters, which we believe is the first such guarantee for open category detection.
102	12	The result can be generalized to the case where n0 < nm; in practice, the larger the mixture sample Sm is, the easier it is to estimate τq, because this provides more alien points for estimating the q-th quantile of Fa.
104	28	The parameter controls a trade-off between sample size and false alarm rate.
105	28	To minimize the false alarm rate, we want to make q large (to obtain a larger threshold), so we want to set q close to η.
