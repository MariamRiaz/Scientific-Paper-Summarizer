"As science advances, scientists around the world continue to produce a large number of research articles, which provide the technological basis for worldwide dissemination of scientific discoveries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Online digital libraries such as Google Scholar, CiteSeerx, and PubMed store and index millions of such research articles and their metadata, and make it easier for researchers to search for scientific information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These libraries require effective and efficient methods for topic classification of research articles in order to facilitate the retrieval of content that is tailored to the interests of specific individuals or groups.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Supervised approaches for topic classification of research articles have been developed, which generally use either the content of the articles (Caragea et al., 2011), or take into account the citation relation between research articles (Lu and Getoor, 2003).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To be successful, these supervised approaches assume the availability of large amounts of labeled
data, which require intensive human labeling effort.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we explore a semi-supervised approach that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with small amounts of labeled data for accurate topic classification of research articles, while minimizing the human effort required for data labeling.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the scholarly domain, research articles (or papers) are highly interconnected in giant citation networks, in which papers cite or are cited by other papers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We posit that, in addition to a document’s textual content and its local neighborhood in the citation network, other information exists that has the potential to improve topic classification.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, in a citation network, information flows from one paper to another via the citation relation (Shi et al., 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This information flow and the topical influence of one paper on another are specifically captured by means of citation contexts, i.e., short text segments surrounding a citation’s mention.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These contexts are not arbitrary, but they often serve as brief summaries of a cited paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We therefore hypothesize that these micro-summaries can be successfully used as an independent view of a research article in a co-training framework to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for the task of topic classification.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The idea of using terms from citation contexts stems from the analysis of hyperlinks and the graph structure of the Web, which are instrumental in Web search (Manning et al., 2008).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Many search engines follow the intuition that the anchor text pointing to a page is a good descriptor of its content, and thus anchor text terms are used as additional index terms for a target webpage.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The use of links and anchor text was thoroughly researched for information retrieval (Koolen and Kamps, 2010), broadening a user’s search (Chakrabarti et al., 1998), query refinement (Kraft and Zien, 2004), and enriching document representations (Metzler et al., 2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Blum and
2357
Mitchell (1998) introduced the co-training algorithm using hyperlinks and anchor text as a second, independent view of the data for classifying webpages, in addition to a webpage content.

Contributions and Organization.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present a co-training approach to topic classification of research papers that effectively incorporates information from a citation network, in addition to the information contained in each paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The result of this classification task will aid indexing of documents in digital libraries, and hence, will lead to improved organization, search, retrieval, and recommendation of scientific documents.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our contributions are as follows:
• We propose the use of citation contexts as an additional view in a co-training approach, which results in high accuracy classifiers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To our knowledge, this has not been addressed in the literature.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We show experimentally that our co-training
classifiers significantly outperform: (1) supervised classifiers trained using either content or citation contexts independently, for the same fraction of labeled data; and (2) several other semi-supervised classifiers, trained on the same fractions of labeled and unlabeled data as co-training.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We also show that using the citation context
information available in citation networks, the human effort involved in data labeling for training accurate classifiers can be largely reduced.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our co-training classifiers trained on a very small sample of labeled data and a large sample of unlabeled data yield accurate topic classification of research articles.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 2, we discuss related work.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Section 3 describes our data and its characteristics, followed by the presentation of our proposed co-training approach in Section 4.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present experiments and results in Section 5, and conclude the paper and present future directions of our work in Section 6.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We discuss here the most relevant works to our study.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
A large variety of methods have been proposed in the literature with regard to automatic text classification and topic prediction.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Different classifiers have been applied on the Vector Space Model (VSM), in which a document is represented as a vector of words or phrases asso-
ciated with their TF-IDF score, i.e. term frequency - inverse document frequency (Zhang et al., 2011; Kansheng et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"VSM is the most used method due to its simple, efficient and easy to understand implementation.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Another widely used model is the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) where co-occurrences are analyzed to find semantic relationships between words or phrases (Zhang et al., 2011; Ganiz et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, a great range of classifiers were used for this task, including: Naı̈ve Bayes (Lewis and Ringuette, 1994), Knearest neighbors (Yang, 1999) and Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These techniques, however, all require a large number of labeled documents in order to build accurate classifiers.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, we propose a co-training algorithm that only requires a small amount of labeled data in order to make accurate topic classification.
Semi-supervised methods essentially involve different means of transferring labels from labeled to unlabeled samples in the process of learning a classifier that can generalize well on new unseen data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Co-training was originally introduced in (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) where it was used to classify web pages into academic course home page or not.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This approach has two views of the data as follows: the content of a web page, and the words found in the anchor text of the hyperlinks that point to the web page.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wan (2009) used co-training for cross-lingual sentiment classification of product reviews, where English and Chinese features were considered as two independent views of the data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, Gollapalli et al. (2013) used co-training to identify authors’ homepages from the current-day university websites.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The paper presents novel features, extracted from the URL of a page, that were used in conjunction with content features, forming two complementary views of the data.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Citation networks have been used before in other problems.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Caragea et al. (2014) used citation contexts to extract informative features for keyphrase extraction.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Lu and Getoor (2003) proposed an approach for document classification that used only citation links, without any textual data from the citation contexts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Ritchie et al. (2006) used a combination of terms from citation contexts and existing index terms of a paper to improve indexing of cited papers.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Citation contexts were also used to improve the performance of citation recommendation systems (Kataria et al., 2010) and to study author influence in document networks
(Kataria et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, citation contexts were used for scientific paper summarization (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011; Qazvinian et al., 2010; Qazvinian and Radev, 2008; Mei and Zhai, 2008; Lehnert et al., 1990)",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, in Qazvinian et al. (2010), a set of important keyphrases is extracted first from the citation contexts in which the paper to be summarized is cited by other papers and then the “best” subset of sentences that contain such keyphrases is returned as the summary.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Mei and Zhai (2008) used information from citation contexts to determine what sentences of a paper are of high impact (as measured by the influence of a target paper on further studies of similar or related topics).,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These sentences constitute the impact-based summary of the paper.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Despite the use of citation contexts and anchor text in many information retrieval and natural language processing tasks, to our knowledge, we are the first to propose the incorporation of citation context information available in citation networks in a co-training framework for topic classification of research papers.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The dataset used in our experiments is a subset sampled from the CiteSeerx digital library1 and labeled by Dr. Lise Getoor’s research group at the University of Maryland.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"This subset was previously used in several studies including (Lu and Getoor, 2003) and (Kataria et al., 2010).",3 Data,[0],[0]
"The dataset consists of 3186 labeled papers, with each paper being categorized into one of six classes: Agents, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) and Databases (DB).",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For each paper, we acquire the citation contexts directly from CiteSeerx.",3 Data,[0],[0]
A citation context is defined as a window of n words surrounding a citation mention.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"We differentiate between cited and citing contexts for a paper as follows: let d be a target paper and C be a citation network such that d ∈ C. A cited context for d is a context in which d is cited by some paper di in C. A citing context for d is a context in which d is citing some paper dj in C. If a paper is cited in multiple contexts within another paper, the contexts are aggregated into a single context.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For each paper in the dataset, we have at least one cited or one citing context.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"A summary of the dataset is provided in Table 1.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
"1http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/
As expected, we have a higher number of cited contexts than citing contexts.",3 Data,[0],[0]
This is due to the page restrictions often imposed to research articles that can limit the number of papers each article can cite.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, a good research paper can accumulate hundreds of citations, and hence, cited contexts over the years.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
Context lengths.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"In CiteSeerx, citation contexts have about 50 words on each side of a citation mention.",3 Data,[0],[0]
A previous study by Ritchie et al. (2008) shows that a fixed window length of about 100 words around a citation mention is generally effective for information retrieval tasks.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"For this reason, we use the contexts provided by CiteSeerx directly.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"In future, it would be interesting to study more sophisticated approaches to identifying the text that is relevant to a target citation (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2012; Teufel, 1999) and study the influence of context lengths on our task.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For all experiments, our labeled dataset is split in train, validation and test sets.",3 Data,[0],[0]
The validation and test sets have about 200 papers each.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"We sampled another set of papers from the labeled dataset in order to simulate the existence of unlabeled data, with a fixed size of around 2000 papers.",3 Data,[0],[0]
The remaining 786 papers are used as labeled training data.,3 Data,[0],[0]
Each experiment was repeated 10 times with 10 different random seeds and the results were averaged.,3 Data,[0],[0]
Blum and Mitchell (1998) proposed the cotraining algorithm in the context of webpage classification.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In co-training, the idea is that two classifiers trained on two different views of the data teach one another by re-training each classifier on the data enriched with predicted examples that the other classifier is most confident about.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In Blum and Mitchell (1998), webpages are represented using two different views: (1) using terms from webpages’ content and (2) using terms from the anchor text of hyperlinks pointing to these pages.

In this paper, we study the applicability and extension of the co-training algorithm to the task of topic classification of research papers, which are embedded in large citation networks.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Here, in addition to the information contained in a paper itself, citing and cited papers capture different aspects (e.g., topicality, domain of study,",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"algorithms used) about the target paper (Teufel et al., 2006), with citation contexts playing an instrumental role.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"We conjecture that citation contexts, which act as brief summaries about a cited paper, provide important clues in predicting the topicality of a target paper.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
These clues give rise to the design of our co-training based model for topic classification of research papers.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In our model, we use the content of a paper as one view and the citation contexts as another view of our data.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In particular, for the content of a paper, we use its title and abstract as it is commonly used in the literature (Lu and Getoor, 2003); for the citation contexts, we use both the cited and citing contexts, as described in the previous section.
",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
Our co-training procedure is described in Algorithm 1.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
L and U represent the labeled and unlabeled datasets and contain instances from both views.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
The fractions of the training set are obtained from the 786 papers by selecting k% random examples from each class.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"For a round of co-training, we train classifiers C1 and C2 on the two views.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Next, s examples are sampled from the unlabeled data into S, and C1, C2 are used to obtain predictions for these s examples.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"The GetMostConfidentExamples method is a generic placeholder that stands for a function that deter-
mines what examples from S are chosen to be added into training.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Finally, at the end of an iteration, the examples left into S are moved back to U , and the algorithm iterates until there are no more unlabeled examples in U .",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
The final classifier C is obtained by combining C1 and C2 using the product of their class probability distributions.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"The class with the highest posterior probability (of the product of the two distributions) is chosen as the predicted class.
",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike the original co-training algorithm described by Blum and Mitchell (1998), which tackled a binary classification task (course vs. noncourse page classification), we address a multiclass classification problem, where each example (i.e., research paper) is classified into one of six different classes.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Moreover, in Blum and Mitchell (1998), the co-training algorithm moves p highest confidence positive examples and n highest confidence negative examples from S to L, where p : n represents the class distribution in the original labeled training set (i.e., if there are 10 positive examples and 90 negative examples in the labeled set L, then p = 1 positive and n = 9 negative examples are moved to the labeled set at each iteration of co-training).",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike, this approach that preserves the class distribution of the original labeled training set, we move into L all examples that are classified with a confidence above a certain threshold.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"First, the proposed method is evaluated on the validation set.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We first compare it against various supervised and semi-supervised baselines.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Next, we report the performance of our co-training algorithm under different scenarios, where either cited or citing contexts are used.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We also show the most informative words for each classifier.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Finally, with the best parameters obtained on the validation set, we report the precision, recall and F1-score, obtained by each method, on the test set.
",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In experiments, the sample size ‘s’ from Algorithm 1 is set to 300, i.e. the number of documents sampled from the unlabeled pool at each iteration; the confidence threshold is set to 0.95, i.e. if both classifiers agree on the class label and have a confidence ≥ 0.95, the instance is labeled and moved into the labeled training set.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"These parameters are estimated on the validation set, but the results are not shown due to space limitation.
",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
Evaluation Measures.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We report results averaged over ten different runs with random splits.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"For each random split, we return the weighted average precision, recall and F1-score.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In all the experiments, we use the Naı̈ve Bayes Multinomial classifier and its Weka implementation2, with term-frequencies as feature values.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"We experimented with both TF and TF-IDF scores, using different classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Naı̈ve Bayes Multinomial, and simple Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers), but Naive Bayes Multinomial with TF performed best.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
How does co-training compare with supervised learning techniques?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we compare our co-training method with two supervised baselines: (1) when only document content is used and (2) when only citation contexts are used.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 1 shows the F1-scores achieved using different initial training sizes.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"We can see that overall, the citation contexts are better at predicting the topic of a document compared with the content, outperforming them in 9 out of 10 experimental settings.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The only exception to this trend is when a small number (5%) of training instances is available, in which case the supervised content view performs better, reaching an F1-score of 0.534.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Regardless, the co-training method shows significant improvement over both baselines, in all experiments.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Starting with an F1-score of 0.572, it continues to improve its performance as the training percentage is increasing.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The maximum F1score, i.e. 0.742, is reached when 30% of the labeled training set is used.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Note that the difference in performance between co-training and the two supervised baselines is statistically significant for
2http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
A fully supervised baseline that uses 100% of the training set achieves an F1-score of 0.720 (using content) and 0.738 (using citation contexts).,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In contrast, co-training requires only 15% of the labeled training set to outperform the fully supervised content baseline and 30% of the training set to outperform the fully supervised citation contexts baseline.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Consequently, using a co-training approach that includes citation contexts as well as the document content can not only increase the performance, but will also significantly reduce the need of expensive labeled instances.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 illustrates the confusion matrices of three experiments: (a) supervised content view, i.e. the title and abstract, (b) supervised citation contexts view, and (c) co-training that uses both views.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
These experiments use 10% of the training set.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Each of the matrices are represented by a heat map, i.e. the redder the color, the higher the value assigned to that position.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
An accuracy of 1 will be represented by a matrix with red blocks on the main diagonal and white blocks everywhere else.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"This experiment was performed 10 times with 10 different seeds and the results have been averaged.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, the matrix that uses only titles and abstracts, i.e. left side, is showing the highest percentage of misclassified documents, classifying correctly about 58.8% instances, on average.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Using only citation contexts in a supervised framework, i.e. center matrix, we reach a higher accuracy of 60.7%.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The co-training method, which uses the content of the paper and citations as two independent views, significantly increases the average accuracy to 67.3%.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
This experiment shows that citation contexts are better than titles and abstracts at predicting the topic of a document.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, our proposed approach, which uses the content of the paper as well as citation contexts, achieves higher results than each view used separately.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The difference in accuracy is statistically significant across all three experiments for a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Overall, the Agents class seem to be the easiest to classify, reaching an accuracy value of 91.6% when using co-training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the AI class is the hardest to classify.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
One reason for this is that the AI class contains the lowest number of instances in the dataset.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Another can be that the AI class is the most general among all classes and therefore, classifying documents with this la-
Left: using titles and abstracts; Center: using citation contexts;",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Right: using co-training.
bel can be a difficult task even for a human.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Other common misclassifications occur between classes like HCI and Agents, ML and IR or AI and ML, due to their similarity.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
How does our co-training method compare with other supervised approaches?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we compare the performance of co-training against two other methods: early and late fusion.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In early fusion, the feature vectors of the two views are concatenated, creating a single representation of the data.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In contrast, late fusion trains two separate classifiers and then combines them by taking the label with the highest confidence.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows this comparison over different training sizes.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The results show that the cotraining method is more accurate than all others, performing best in all 10 experimental settings.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Late fusion has an overall lower performance compared with co-training, but is in a tight correlation with it.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, early fusion achieves the lowest F1-score across the experiments.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The reported results are statistically significant at p value of 0.05, when the training percentage is between 5 and 35.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we can say that train-
ing two separate classifiers, one of each view, yields higher performance compared with training a single classifier that incorporates both views.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Moreover, using a co-training approach that incorporates information from unlabeled data into the model, will help the two classifiers increase their confidences and minimize the error rate.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
How does co-training compare with semisupervised methods?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Here, we present results comparing co-training with two other wellknown semi-supervised techniques: self-training and Naı̈ve Bayes with Expectation Maximization.
Self-Training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"First, we show results of the comparison of co-training with two variations of selftraining: (1) self-training using only document content, and (2) self-training using only citation contexts.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 4 shows the results of this experiment.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Self-training is similar to co-training, except that it uses only one view of the data (Zhu, 2005).",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Self-training parameters, e.g., sample size ‘s’ or number of iterations, are estimated as in cotraining.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Although the document content version of selftraining outperforms co-training when using 5%
of the training instances, we can see that overall, there is a significant difference in terms of F1score values in the favor of co-training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In 9 out of 10 experiments, our co-training approach is superior to both self-training methods.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The results are statistically significant across all experimental setups for a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Expectation Maximization.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Figure 5 shows the F1-score values obtained after running NBM with EM with the same training, unlabeled and test sets.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The EM algorithm uses the same classifier, i.e. NBM, and the weight for each unlabeled instance is set to 1, as this setting achieved the highest results.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Two different experiments were performed using EM: (1) using only document content, and (2) using only citation contexts.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in the figure, overall, the co-training approach significantly outperforms both variations of EM.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"However, the co-training method falls short when using 5% of the training instances, where EM Content and EM Citations methods are achieving higher F1-score values.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Nonetheless, both EM variations tend to achieve an F1-score value below or equal to 0.710, whereas co-training reaches performance values of 0.74 or higher.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Again, the comparison results between co-training and both variations of EM are statistically significant for training sizes between 10% and 50%, for a p value of 0.05.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Which of the two types of citation contexts (cited or citing) help the task of topic classification more and how does co-training perform in the absence of either one?,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
The answer to this question is important as there are cases in which citation contexts are not readily available.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"One frequently encountered example includes newly published research papers that have no cited contexts.
",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"In this case, it is important to know how our method performs when we only have one type of citation contexts.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"Figure 6 shows the difference in performance when using: (1) only cited contexts, (2) only citing contexts, and (3) both context types.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"Note that the content view remains the same across all three experiments.
",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
The plot is showing that citing contexts are bringing in a significantly higher margin of knowledge compared with cited contexts.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"This is consistent over different training set sizes, as shown in the figure, with a more prominent impact when a small training size is used, i.e. 5-30%.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"The fact that the citing contexts achieve higher F1-score than cited contexts is consistent with the intuition that when citing a paper y, an author generally summarizes the main ideas from y using important words from a target paper x, making the citing contexts to have higher overlap with words from x.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"In turn, a paper z that cites x may use paraphrasing to summarize ideas from x with words more similar to those from the content of z.
When the two types of contexts are used, cotraining achieves higher results compared with cases when only one context type is used.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
This experiment shows that our method can be applied for both old and new research articles.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
Citing contexts will be available in the text of the target paper and are independent of the existence of the cited contexts.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
What are the most informative words from each view: document content and citation contexts?,5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
Figure 7 shows the words from each view that are most useful for our topic classification task.,5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"The larger the word, the more informative is for our
task.",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"To determine the informativeness of a word, we used its Information Gain score.",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"For these experiments, we used training sets consisting of 30% of the instances, setting in which we achieved the best results on the validation and test sets using our proposed co-training approach.
",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, the two word clouds have a high word overlap.",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]

"In this paper, we focus on full information games in which it is assumed that the feedback supplied at trial t by the environment is the entire vector `t. On the other hand, we make very few assumptions about the decision set: S may be described by an arbitrary SAT formula, that is, any set of combinatorial constraints representable by Boolean clauses.",1.

"As SAT encodings of discrete solution spaces are frequently used in academic and industrial applications (Biere et al., 2009), our setting covers an important class of combinatorial prediction games.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As usual, the performance of an online learning algorithm is measured according to two metrics.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The first, called regret, measures the difference in cumulative loss between the algorithm and the best solution in hindsight.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this study, we make no assumption about the sequence of loss vectors; in particular `t may depend on the previous decisions s1, · · · , st−1 made by the learner.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Related Work.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the literature of combinatorial prediction games, three main strategies have been proposed to attain an expected regret that is sublinear in the game horizon T and polynomial in the input dimension d. The
first, and arguably simplest strategy, is to Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL): on each trial t, the learner draws at random a perturbation vector zt ∈ Rd, and then selects in S a minimizer of ηLt + zt, where η ∈ (0, 1] is a step-size parameter, andLt is the cumulative lossLt = `1 + · · ·+`t−1.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Based on the pioneering work of Hannan (1957), refined in (Hutter & Poland, 2005; Kalai & Vempala, 2005), the FPL algorithm achieves an expected regret of O(d 32 √ T ).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The second strategy is based on the popular exponentially weighted average forecaster in the framework of prediction with expert advice (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The overall idea is to maintain a weight for each feasible solution s ∈ S, which decays exponentially according to the estimated cumulative loss of s. Specifically, on each trial t, the learner draws a solution st ∈ S at random from the exponential family pt(s) ∼ exp(−η〈Lt, s〉).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This strategy, referred to as Expanded Hedge (EH) in (Koolen et al., 2010), attains an expected regret of O(d 32 √ T ).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, the third strategy is to Follow the Regularized Leader, a paradigm often advocated in online convex optimization (Hazan, 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here, the learner operates on the convex hull of S, denoted conv(S).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"On each trial t, the learner starts by choosing a point pt ∈ conv(S) that minimizes η〈L̂t,p〉 + F (p), where F is a regularization function.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Next, pt is decomposed as a convex composition of feasible solutions in S, and then, a decision st is picked at random according to the resulting distribution.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For modular loss functions, this strategy is equivalent to the Online Stochastic Mirror Descent (OSMD) algorithm (Audibert et al., 2014; Rajkumar & Agarwal, 2014), which iteratively performs a gradient descent in the dual space of conv(S) under F , and projects back to the primal space according to the Bregman divergence defined from F .",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Notably, when F is the Euclidean regularizer, OSMD coincides with the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm (Robbins & Monro, 1951).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, when F is the entropic regularizer, OSMD corresponds to the Component Hedge (CH) algorithm (Koolen et al., 2010), which achieves an optimal expected regret of O(d √ T ).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"From the viewpoint of regret, the results outlined above indicate that few improvements remain to be made in full information games.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, we get a different picture if computational considerations are taken into account: all aforementioned algorithms rely on powerful oracles for making decisions in spaces S represented by combinatorial constraints.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Namely, the EH algorithm is required, at each iteration, to sample a solution according to an exponential family over S , a problem which is generally #P-hard (Dyer et al., 2009).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Similarly, the FPL strategy has to repeatedly solve a linear optimization task over S, which is generally NP-hard (Creignou et al., 2001).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the OSMD algorithm, and its specializations SGD and CH, the computational issue
is exacerbated by the fact that, even if the learner has access to a linear optimization oracle, it still has to perform, at each trial, a Bregman projection step for which the best known algorithms run in O(d6) time (Suehiro et al., 2012).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although combinatorial prediction games are generally intractable, efficient implementations of sampling and optimization oracles may be obtained for several decision sets S. For example, when the feasible solutions in S coincide with the bases of a binary matroid, or the perfect matchings of a bipartite graph, linear optimization can be performed in polynomial time, and tractable forms of FPL and OSMD may be derived (Helmbold & Warmuth, 2009; Koolen et al., 2010; Takimoto & Hatano, 2013; Rajkumar & Agarwal, 2014).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, when the feasible solutions in S correspond to the paths or multi-paths of a rooted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), the sampling oracle may be implemented by the weight pushing technique (Mohri, 1998), that recursively evaluates the partition function of an exponential family over the edges of the input DAG.",1.

"With these compilation tools in hand, our contributions are threefold: (i) we show that for dDNNF circuits, the sampling oracle in EH and the linear optimization oracle in FPL, run in linear time using a simple variant of the weight-
pushing technique; (ii) for the SGD and CH strategies, we develop a Bregman projection-decomposition method that uses O(d2 ln(dT ))",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"In both environments, the agent’s observation consists of a bag of words, where the words correspond to (feature, location).",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"Features consist of item types, names, and their other properties.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"The locations include position relative to the agent in the maze, and also a few special slots for inventory, current, and target attributes.
",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
Training proceeds according to Algorithm 1.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"During the explore phase, an exploratory policy is trained with reinforcement learning using a count-based reward proportional
to c⇡e(⇢i, ⇢j)P",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"i,j c⇡e(⇢i, ⇢j) + 0.001 !",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"0.5
for making a transition (⇢i, ⇢j), where c⇡e(⇢i, ⇢j) is the number of times transition (⇢i, ⇢j) has been seen so far.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"We discuss this exploration bonus in Appendix A.
During the final phase of training we simultaneously compute ⇡ and c⇡ , so we use an exponentially decaying average of the success rate of ⇡ to deal with it’s nonstationarity:
c⇡(⇢i, ⇢j) =
PT t=1
T tSt⇡(⇢i, ⇢j)PT t=1 T tAt⇡(⇢i, ⇢j) ,
where T is the number of training epochs, At⇡ is the number of attempted transitions (⇢i, ⇢j) during epoch t, and St⇡ is the number of successful transitions.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
A decay rate of = 0.9 is used.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"More details of the model and training are provided in Appendix C.
In the switches environment, multi-step test tasks are generated by setting a random attribute as target, which can require up to 12 attribute transitions.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"In the crafting environment, test tasks are generated by randomly selecting a (crafted) item as a target.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"Since we do not care about other items in the inventory, the target state is underspecified.
",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
We produce a curriculum baseline by gradually increase the upper bound on the difficulty of tasks during training.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"In the switches environment, the difficulty corresponds to the number of toggles necessary for solving the task.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"The craft environment has two levels of difficulty: tasks can be completed by a single grab or craft action, and tasks that require multiple such actions.
",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
Table 3 compares our Attribute Planner (AP) to a reinforcement learning baseline on the mazebase tasks.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"The AP planning outperforms purely reactive training regardless of whether one-step, multi-step, or a curriculum of training examples is provided.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"Finally, we test our approach for planning a build order in StarCraft: Brood War (Synnaeve et al., 2016).",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"We consider the space of tasks of building particular units in a fixed time of 500 steps, e.g. “build 1 barracks and 2 marines“.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"This task is challenging for RL because the agent must complete a number of distinct steps, e.g. mine enough ore, then build a barracks, and finally train marines using the barracks, before receiving a reward.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Each of these steps requires the agent have to control multiple units of different types using low-level actions similar to how a human plays the game.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"See Appendix D for more details.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"As in (Sukhbaatar et al., 2017), we restrict the game to the Terran race and only allow construction of certain units.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"In the small version, the agent can mine ore and build SCVs, supply depots, barracks, and marines.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"In the large version, an engineering bay and missile turrets are included as well.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"The attributes are chosen to be the number of units and resources of each type, specifically
{min(bNore/25c, 40), NSCV , Ndepot, Nbarracks, Nmarine}
where Nx is the number of x present in the game, including units under construction.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"The large version also include {Neng.bay, Nturrets}.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Models are trained for a total of 30 million steps.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
AP uses 16 million steps for exploration and 14 million steps for training ⇡.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"Table 4 shows the final performance of the AP model and reactive RL baselines on this task after 30 million steps of training.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"AP exploration finds 120,000 and 420,000 edges for the small and large versions, respectively.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
The size and scaling of this graph show the limitations of a fully explicit graph.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"In fact, we represent the ore attribute as bNore/25c because it decreases the size of the graph by a factor of 25: otherwise for each transition w.r.t.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"the other attributes, the graph would have a separate edge for each valid value of total ore.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Count-based exploration over attributes is vital during the Explore phase in StarCraft.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"If a random policy is used in the small version, only 2047 edges are discovered as opposed to 120,000 using count-based exploration, and the final performance is reduced from 31.7% to 6.4%.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Our results show that structuring the space of tasks with high level attributes allows an agent to compose policies for simple tasks into solutions of more complex tasks.,5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"The agent plans a path to the final goal at the level of the attributes, and executes the steps in this path with a reactive policy.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Thus, supervision of an agent by labeling attributes can lead to generalization from simple tasks at train time to more complex tasks at test time.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"There are several fronts for further work:
Sample complexity of the planning module: In Table 2 we can see both the benefits and the liabilities of the explicit non-parametric form for c⇡ .",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"By 10K samples, the parametric lower level policy is already able to have a reasonable success rate.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, because in this environment, there are over 200K edges in the graph, most of the edges have not been seen, and without any weight-sharing, our model cannot estimate these transition probabilities.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, by 100K samples the model has seen enough of the graph to make nontrivial plans; and the non-parametric form of the graph makes planning straightforward.
",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"In future work, we hope to combine parametric models for c⇡ with search to increase the sample efficiency of the planning module.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, we might hope to make progress on dynamic abstraction (projecting out some of the attributes) depending on the current state and goal, which would make the effective number of edges of the graph smaller.
",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Exploration We have shown that the attributes ⇢ and counts c⇡, in addition to their usefulness for planning, provide a framework for incentivizing exploration.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"In this work we considered a simple count-based exploration strategy, which achieved better exploration in attribute space than random exploration.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, this setting of pure exploration where there are no empirical rewards is different from the classic problem of exploration in an MDP, and warrants further exploration (see Appendix A).
",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
Learning the attributes: Discovering the attributes automatically would remove much of the need for human supervision.,5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Recent work, such as (Thomas et al., 2017), demonstrates how this could be done.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Another avenue for discovering attributes is to use a few “seed” attributes, which is necessary for task specification anyway, and use aliasing as a signal that some attributes need to be refined.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
The tasks that an agent will need to solve often are not known during training.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"However, if the agent knows which properties of the environment are important then, after learning how its actions affect those properties, it may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifically for them.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Towards this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We propose a method that learns a policy for transitioning between “nearby” sets of attributes, and maintains a graph of possible transitions.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We show in 3D block stacking, gridworld games, and StarCraft that our model is able to generalize to longer, more complex tasks at test time by composing simpler learned policies.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"Clustering is one of the most widely used techniques in data analysis (Xu & Wunsch, 2005; Jain, 2010).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite a rich literature on pure continuous data or pure categorical data, the clustering problem remains challenging for mixed-type data, i.e., data with both types of attributes (Everitt et al., 2001).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Mixed-type data are ubiquitous in real world domains, e.g., social science, biomedicine and finance, where categorical attributes often describe demographic information or questionnaire responses, and continuous attributes often correspond to quantitative measurements.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, only a very limited number of clustering methods have been proposed for such data (Everitt et al., 2001; Huang, 1998).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The major challenge is the lack of a good geometric intuition of data on the mixed-type domain;

"such intuition is the important basis of many successful geometric clustering methods, e.g., k-means (MacQueen et al., 1967), Ward’s method (Ward Jr, 1963), DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996), to name a few.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In practice, what usually being done is to convert mixed-type data to either pure continuous or pure categorical domain, and subsequently use existing geometric clustering methods.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A metric for directly dealing with mixed-type data is also available, based on Gower’s coefficient (1971).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The uptake of geometric clustering methods is mostly driven by their lightweight computational requirements.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, these methods lack a well justified underlying probabilistic model, are sensitive to the choice of underlying metric, and do not give a principled answer to the fundamental question of required number of clusters for the data at hand.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose a probabilistic clustering method for mixed-type data, which admits at least four attractive properties.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, our probabilistic method goes beyond the widely-adopted class conditional independence assumption of feature variables, e.g., as in the latent class model (McCutcheon, 1987).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, our method is based on the global topographical features, i.e., peaks and mountains, of the density function, rather than the distances between data points.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The argument for topographical features is to sidestep a premature specification of the metric space in which our mixed-type data will achieve the best grouping.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third, our method is able to utilize a persistent homology theory to automatically determine the number of clusters in the data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Fourth, the proposed method can be easily parallelized to achieve a competitive running time with respect to many lightweight geometric clustering methods.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"From the modeling perspective, we compose tree graphical models with topographical features to achieve a probabilistic mixed-type clustering model.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Graphical models provide a way of factorizing a joint probability distribution into a product of local interactions.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
These local interactions capture dependency among feature variables.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
While a Bayesian network or a Markov random field can be built with a set of nodes representing each feature variable.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The graph structure and parameter estimation can be computationally expensive.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"By constraining the graph to be a tree, the structure and parameter can be learned efficiently.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Other than computational benefits, tree-structured
graphical models also provide a modeling elegance; with a tree structure, we have a factorization that explicitly corresponds to empirical univariate and bivariate marginal distributions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the bivariate distributions, we can then adapt the product kernel density estimation (Scott, 2015) to capture interaction between continuous-continuous variables, between categorical-categorical variables, and between categorical-continuous variables.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Having modeled the data generation process via a tree graphical model, we are left with finding a robust approach for assigning each data point to its cluster.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To achieve this, we adopt a topological perspective, namely, we view a probability distribution as a terrain function, called the density landscape, and capture its topographical features as the basis for defining clusters.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The topographical features include modes (peaks) and their attractive basins.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For high-dimension and sparse data, it is natural to have many modes.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To avoid over-segmentation of the data and generation of many clusters with only few members, we employ a persistent homology theory (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010) to measure the saliency of all modes and merge the trivial ones.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our principled method for clustering mixed-type data respects the underlying topographical features of the density landscape and achieves competitive performance on real data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Clustering has been extensively studied in machine learning and data mining.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Many comprehensive surveys have been produced detailing the landscape of clustering problems and models.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Here we will review related work in the context of geometric versus probabilistic clustering methods for mixed-type data and clustering methods that rely on topographical features such as modes and their attractive basins.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Geometric clustering methods A straightforward approach for mixed-type data clustering is to map them into either pure continuous or pure categorical domains before applying a standard clustering method.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"A metric based on Gower’s coefficient (Gower, 1971) has been proposed for mixed-type data, which rescales the difference in all dimensions, continuous or categorical, and take the average.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
One can apply any distance based method using these metrics.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, all these methods are heuristic; there is no good justification for the underlying geometric intuition of these methods on such a counter-intuitive metric space, despite some successful stories in practice.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, K-Prototypes algorithm (Huang, 1998) uses a weighted sum of the Euclidean distance and Hamming distance and adopts the K-Means method (Faber, 1994), which iteratively finds the mean of each cluster and re-associates data to different clusters.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"When the data is pure categorical, the method is called K-Modes (Huang, 1997).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Chiu et al. (2001) proposed a hierarchical clustering method, in
which distance between clusters are measured using their log-likelihood, which treat continuous and categorical domain separately.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Probabilistic clustering methods Graphical models have been applied to clustering before.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Zhang (2004) proposed a latent tree model, i.e., a Bayesian tree whose leaf nodes correspond to all observed dimensions and internal nodes are latent variables determining different clusters.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Such tree structure can be learned using efficient algorithms (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, this method is only restricted to categorical data.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Lee & Hastie (2015) proposed a loopy graphical model to model mixed-type data.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their model reduces to a discrete Markov random field when all attributes are categorical, and a Gaussian graphical model when all attributes are continuous.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Parameters are learned using pseudo-likelihood estimation (Besag, 1975) and edges are selected using group sparsity penalties (Yuan & Lin, 2006; Huang & Zhang, 2010).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, an efficient inference model is missing in order to apply such model to clustering.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Clustering by mode-seeking The density landscape has been exploited before to extract global properties of the data and to achieve better clustering quality.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Mode-seeking methods, i.e., associating data to modes representing clusters, have been proposed before in continuous domain (Cheng, 1995; Comaniciu & Meer, 2002b).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"But such methods rely on a kernel density estimation, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality and thus do not scale to high dimensions (Wasserman, 2013, chap. 20).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Chen & Quadrianto (2016) proposed a mode-seeking method for categorical data clustering.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, their method tends to produce trivial modes/clusters and thus over-segments the data, mainly due to the lack a principled way to merge modes into clusters of proper size.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Persistent homology for merging clusters In recent years, novel approaches have been proposed to merge modes/clusters based on the topographical landscape of the density function.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Chazal et al. (2013) used topological persistence to guide the merging of data into clusters.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their method, although theoretically sound, relies on a k-nearest neighbor graph of the data and a given density function, e.g., a kernel density estimation (Silverman, 1986) or a distance from measure (Chazal et al., 2011).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
This method assumes that the data is a high quality sample of the domain and the k-nearest neighbor graph faithfully captures the topographical characteristics of the distribution.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, this condition is often too strong to assume in practice, where most datasets are relatively sparse.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose to start with mode-seeking, and leverage these modes and the gradient paths as a more accurate account of the density landscape.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Our idea proves to be a better solution and a good complement to the theoretical tool.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"We also refer to other topological and geometrical studies into the
global structures of hierarchical clustering (Eldridge et al., 2015; Carlsson & Mémoli, 2010).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]

Our RBCML framework leverages the strengths of rank breaking and CML.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The major advantage of CML is that often marginal likelihood functions are much easier to optimize than the full likeli-
hood function.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, for RUMs, even computing the marginal likelihood may take too much time, as CML needs to count the number of pairwise comparisons between alternatives in the rankings, which takes O(m2n) time, where m is the number of alternatives and n is the number of rankings.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, standard CML becomes inefficient when m or n are large.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
RBCML overcomes such inefficiency by applying rank-breaking.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"The lexicographic approach can capture finer-grained meaning distinctions, at a risk of relying upon idiosyncratic and potentially incomplete dictionary definitions.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"The semantic class approach, which we follow here, focuses on commonalities in meaning across multiple lexical items, and aims to general-
2Of course, meanings marked by prepositions/possessives are to some extent captured in predicate-argument or graphbased meaning representations (e.g., Palmer et al., 2005; Fillmore and Baker, 2009; Oepen et al., 2016; Banarescu et al., 2013) and domain-centric representations like TimeML and ISO-Space (Pustejovsky et al., 2003, 2012).
ize more easily to new types and usages.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"The most recent class-based approach to prepositions was our initial framework of 75 preposition supersenses arranged in a multiple inheritance taxonomy (Schneider et al., 2015, 2016).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"It was based largely on relation/role inventories of Srikumar and Roth (2013) and VerbNet (Bonial et al., 2011; Palmer et al., 2017).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"The framework was realized in version 3.0 of our comprehensively annotated corpus, STREUSLE3 (Schneider et al., 2016).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"However, several limitations of our approach became clear to us over time.
",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"First, as pointed out by Hwang et al. (2017), the one-label-per-token assumption in STREUSLE is flawed because it in some cases puts into conflict the semantic role of the PP with respect to a predicate, and the lexical semantics of the preposition itself.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Hwang et al. (2017) suggested a solution, discussed in §3.3, but did not conduct an annotation study or release a corpus to establish its feasibility empirically.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"We address that gap here.
",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Second, 75 categories is an unwieldy number for both annotators and disambiguation systems.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Some are quite specialized and extremely rare in STREUSLE 3.0, which causes data sparseness issues for supervised learning.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"In fact, the only published disambiguation system for preposition supersenses collapsed the distinctions to just 12 labels (Gonen and Goldberg, 2016).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
Hwang et al. (2017) remarked that solving the aforementioned problem could remove the need for many of the specialized categories and make the taxonomy more tractable for annotators and systems.,2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"We substantiate this here, defining a new hierarchy with just 50 categories (SNACS, §3) and providing disambiguation results for the full set of distinctions.
",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Finally, given the semantic overlap of possessive case and the preposition of, we saw an opportunity to broaden the application of the scheme to include possessives.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Our reannotated corpus, STREUSLE 4.0, thus has supersense annotations for over 1000 possessive tokens that were not semantically annotated in version 3.0.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
We include these in our annotation and disambiguation experiments alongside reannotated preposition tokens.,2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Apart from canonical prepositions and possessives, there are many lexically and semantically overlap-
3https://github.com/nert-gu/streusle/
ping closed-class items which are sometimes classified as other parts of speech, such as adverbs, particles, and subordinating conjunctions.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002) argues for an expansive definition of ‘preposition’ that would encompass these other categories.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"As a practical measure, we decided to encourage annotators to focus on the semantics of these functional items rather than their syntax, so we take an inclusive stance.
",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
Another consideration is developing annotation guidelines that can be adapted for other languages.,3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"This includes languages which have postpositions, circumpositions, or inpositions rather than prepositions; the general term for such items is adpositions.4 English possessive marking (via ’s or possessive pronouns like my) is more generally an example of case marking.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"Note that prepositions (4a–4c) differ in word order from possessives (4d), though semantically the object of the preposition and the possessive nominal pattern together:
(4) a. eat in a restaurant b. the man in a blue shirt c. the wife of the ambassador d. the ambassador’s wife
Cross-linguistically, adpositions and case marking are closely related, and in general both grammatical strategies can express similar kinds of semantic relations.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"This motivates a common semantic inventory for adpositions and case.
",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"We also cover multiword prepositions (e.g., out_of, in_front_of), intransitive particles (He flew away), purpose infinitive clauses (Open the door to let in some air5), prepositions with clausal complements (It rained before the party started), and idiomatic prepositional phrases (at_large).",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
Our annotation guidelines give further details.,3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"The hierarchy of preposition and possessive supersenses, which we call Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses (SNACS), is shown in figure 2.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"It is simpler than its predecessor— Schneider et al.’s (2016) preposition supersense hierarchy—in both size and structural complexity.

"Counts are of direct uses of labels, excluding uses of subcategories.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Role and function positions are not distinguished (so if a token has different role and function labels, it will count toward two supersense frequencies).
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
SNACS has 50 supersenses at 4 levels of depth; the previous hierarchy had 75 supersenses at 7 levels.,3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"The top-level categories are the same:
• CIRCUMSTANCE:",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Circumstantial information, usually non-core properties of events (e.g., location, time, means, purpose) •",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
PARTICIPANT: Entity playing a role in an event • CONFIGURATION:,3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Thing, usually an entity or property, involved in a static relationship to some other entity The 3 subtrees loosely parallel adverbial adjuncts, event arguments, and adnominal complements, respectively.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"The PARTICIPANT and CIRCUMSTANCE subtrees primarily reflect semantic relationships prototypical to verbal arguments/adjuncts and were inspired by VerbNet’s thematic role hierarchy (Palmer et al., 2017; Bonial et al., 2011).",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Many CIRCUMSTANCE subtypes, like LOCUS (the concrete or abstract location of something), can be governed by eventive and non-eventive nominals as well as verbs: eat in the restaurant, a party in the restaurant, a table in the restaurant.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"CONFIGURATION mainly encompasses non-spatiotemporal relations holding between entities, such as quantity, possession, and part/whole.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Unlike the previous hierarchy, SNACS does not use multiple inheritance, so there is no overlap between the 3 regions.
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"The supersenses can be understood as roles in fundamental types of scenes (or schemas) such as: LOCATION—THEME is located at LO-
CUS; MOTION—THEME moves from SOURCE along PATH to GOAL; TRANSITIVE ACTION— AGENT acts on THEME, perhaps using an INSTRUMENT;",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"POSSESSION—POSSESSION belongs to POSSESSOR; TRANSFER—THEME changes possession from ORIGINATOR to RECIPIENT, perhaps with COST;",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"PERCEPTION—EXPERIENCER is mentally affected by STIMULUS; COGNITION— EXPERIENCER contemplates TOPIC; COMMUNICATION—information (TOPIC) flows from ORIGINATOR to RECIPIENT, perhaps via an INSTRUMENT.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"For AGENT, CO-AGENT, EXPERIENCER, ORIGINATOR, RECIPIENT, BENEFICIARY, POSSESSOR, and SOCIALREL, the object of the preposition is prototypically animate.
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Because prepositions and possessives cover a vast swath of semantic space, limiting ourselves to 50 categories means we need to address a great many nonprototypical, borderline, and special cases.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"We have done so in a 75-page annotation manual with over 400 example sentences (Schneider et al., 2018).
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Finally, we note that the Universal Semantic Tagset (Abzianidze and Bos, 2017) defines a crosslinguistic inventory of semantic classes for content and function words.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"SNACS takes a similar approach to prepositions and possessives, which in Abzianidze and Bos’s (2017) specification are simply tagged REL, which does not disambiguate the nature of the relational meaning.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
Our categories can thus be understood as refinements to REL.,3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
Hwang et al. (2017) have pointed out the perils of teasing apart and generalizing preposition semantics so that each use has a clear supersense label.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
One key challenge they identified is that the preposition itself and the situation as established by the verb may suggest different labels.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"For instance:
(5) a. Vernon works at Grunnings.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"b. Vernon works for Grunnings.
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"The semantics of the scene in (5a, 5b) is the same: it is an employment relationship, and the PP contains the employer.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"SNACS has the label ORGROLE for this purpose.6 At the same time, at in (5a) strongly suggests a locational relationship, which would correspond to the label LOCUS; consistent with this
6ORGROLE is defined as “Either a party in a relation between an organization/institution and an individual who has a stable affiliation with that organization, such as membership or a business relationship.”
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"hypothesis, Where does Vernon work? is a perfectly good way to ask a question that could be answered by the PP.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"In this example, then, there is overlap between locational meaning and organizationalbelonging meaning.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
(5b) is similar except the for suggests a notion of BENEFICIARY:,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
the employee is working on behalf of the employer.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
Annotators would face a conundrum if forced to pick a single label when multiple ones appear to be relevant.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Schneider et al. (2016) handled overlap via multiple inheritance, but entertaining a new label for every possible case of overlap is impractical, as this would result in a proliferation of supersenses.
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Instead, Hwang et al. (2017) suggest a construal analysis in which the lexical semantic contribution, or henceforth the function, of the preposition itself may be distinct from the semantic role or relation mediated by the preposition in a given sentence, called the scene role.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
The notion of scene role is a widely accepted idea that underpins the use of semantic or thematic roles: semantics licensed by the governor7 of the prepositional phrase dictates its relationship to the prepositional phrase.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"The innovative claim is that, in addition to a preposition’s relationship with its head, the prepositional choice introduces another layer of meaning or construal that brings additional nuance, creating the difficulty we see in the annotation of (5a, 5b).",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
Construal is notated by ROLE;FUNCTION.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Thus, (5a) would be annotated ORGROLE;LOCUS and (5b) as ORGROLE;BENEFICIARY to expose their common truth-semantic meaning but slightly different portrayals owing to the different prepositions.
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Another useful application of the construal analysis is with the verb put, which can combine with any locative PP to express a destination:
(6) Put it on/by/behind/on_top_of/. . .",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]

I.e., the preposition signals a LOCUS, but the door serves as the GOAL with respect to the scene.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"This approach also allows for resolution of various se-
7By “governor” of the preposition or prepositional phrase, we mean the head of the phrase to which the PP attaches in a constituency representation.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"In a dependency representation, this would be the head of the preposition itself or of the object of the preposition depending on which convention is used for PP headedness: e.g., the preposition heads the PP in CoNLL and Stanford Dependencies whereas the object is the head in Universal Dependencies.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
The governor is most often a verb or noun.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Where the PP is a predicate complement (e.g. Vernon is with Grunnings), there is no governor to specify the nature of the scene, so annotators must rely on world knowledge and context to determine the scene.

Both role and function slots are filled by supersenses from the SNACS hierarchy.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
Annotators have the option of using distinct supersenses for the role and function; in general it is not a requirement (though we stipulate that certain SNACS supersenses can only be used as the role).,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]

"We chose SaintExupéry’s novella The Little Prince, which is readily available in many languages and has been annotated with semantic representations such as AMR (Banarescu et al., 2013).",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"The genre is markedly different from online reviews—it is quite literary, and employs archaic or poetic figures of speech.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"It is also a translation from French, contributing to the markedness of the language.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
This text is therefore a challenge for an annotation scheme based on colloquial contemporary English.,5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"We addressed this issue by running 3 practice rounds of annotation on small passages from The Little Prince, both to assess whether the scheme was applicable without major guidelines changes and to prepare the annotators for this genre.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"For the final annotation study, we chose chapters 4 and 5, in which 242 markables of 52 types were identified heuristically (§6.2).",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"The types of, to, in, as, from, and for, as well as possessives, occurred at least 10 times.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"Annotators had the option to mark units as false positives using special labels (see §4) in addition to expressing uncertainty about the unit.

"Agreement is higher on the function slot than on the scene role slot, which implies that the former is an easier task than the latter.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]

We now describe systems that identify and disambiguate SNACS-annotated prepositions and possessives in two steps.,6 Disambiguation Systems,[0],[0]
Target identification heuristics (§6.2) first determine which tokens (single-word or multiword) should receive a SNACS supersense.,6 Disambiguation Systems,[0],[0]
A supervised classifier then predicts a supersense analysis for each identified target.,6 Disambiguation Systems,[0],[0]

"Furthermore, 14.1% of tokens labeled as adpositions or possessives are not annotated because they are part of a multiword expression (MWE).",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"It is therefore neither obvious nor trivial to decide which tokens and groups of tokens should be selected as targets for SNACS annotation.
",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"To facilitate both manual annotation and automatic classification, we developed heuristics for identifying annotation targets.",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"The algorithm first scans the sentence for known multiword expressions, using a blacklist of non-prepositional MWEs that contain preposition tokens (e.g., take_care_of ) and a whitelist of prepositional MWEs (multiword prepositions like out_of and PP idioms like in_town).",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
Both lists were constructed from the training data.,6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"From segments unaffected by the MWE heuristics, single-word candidates are identified by matching a high-recall set of parts of speech, then filtered through 5 different heuristics for adpositions, possessives, subordinating conjunctions, adverbs, and infinitivals.",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"Most of these filters are based on lexical lists learned from the training portion of the STREUSLE corpus, but there are some specific rules for infinitivals that handle forsubjects (I opened the door for Steve to take out the trash—to, but not for, should receive a supersense) and comparative constructions with too and enough (too short to ride).",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]

"We briefly describe the feature set here, and refer the reader to the original work for further details.",6.3 Classification,[0],[0]
"At a high level, it consists of features extracted from selected neighboring words in the dependency tree (i.e., heuristically identified governor and object) and in the sentence (previous verb, noun and adjective, and next noun).",6.3 Classification,[0],[0]

"For each identified target unit u, we extract its first token, and its governor and object headword.",6.3 Classification,[0],[0]

The rest of this section presents analyses of the results along various axes.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
Target identification.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
The identification heuristics described in §6.2 achieve an F1 score of 89.2% on the test set using gold syntax.15,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
Most false positives (47/54=87%) can be ascribed to tokens that are part of a (non-adpositional or larger adpositional) multiword expression.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"9 of the 50 false negatives (18%) are rare multiword expressions not occurring in the training data and there are 7 partially identified ones, which are counted as both false positives and false negatives.
",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
Automatically generated parse trees slightly decrease quality (table 4).,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Target identification, being the first step in the pipeline, imposes an upper bound on disambiguation scores.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"We observe this degradation when we compare the Gold ID and the Auto ID blocks of table 5, where automatically identified targets decrease F-score by about 10 points in all settings.16
Classification.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Along with the statistical classifier results in table 5, we also report performance
15Our evaluation script counts tokens that received special labels in the gold standard (see §4) as negative examples of SNACS targets, with the exception of the tokens labeled as unintelligible/nonnative/etc., which are not counted toward or against target ID performance.

"Note that all learned classifiers, across all settings, outperform the most frequent baseline for both role and function prediction.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"The feature-rich and the neural models perform roughly equivalently despite the significantly different modeling strategies.

Function and scene role performance.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Function prediction is consistently more accurate than role prediction, with roughly a 10-point gap across all systems.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"This mirrors a similar effect in the interannotator agreement scores (see §5), and may be due to the reduced ambiguity of functions compared to roles (as attested by the baseline’s higher accuracy for functions than roles), and by the more literal nature of function labels, as opposed to role labels that often require more context to determine.
Impact of automatic syntax.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Automatic syntactic analysis decreases scores by 4 to 7 points, most likely due to parsing errors which affect the identification of the preposition’s object and governor.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"In the auto ID/auto syntax condition, the worse target ID performance with automatic parses (noted above) contributes to lower classification scores.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
We can use the structure of the SNACS hierarchy to probe classifier performance.,6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
"As with the interannotator study, we evaluate the accuracy of predicted labels when they are coarsened post hoc by moving up the hierarchy to a specific depth.",6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
"Table 6 shows this for the feature-rich classifier for different depths, with depth-1 representing the coarsening of the labels into the 3 root labels.",6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
Depth-4 (Exact) represents the full results in table 5.,6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
These results show that the classifiers often mistake a label for another that is nearby in the hierarchy.,6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
"Examining the most frequent confusions of both models, we observe that LOCUS is overpredicted
(which makes sense as it is most frequent overall), and SOCIALROLE–ORGROLE and GESTALT– POSSESSOR are often confused (they are close in the hierarchy: one inherits from the other).",6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]

"In compressed sensing, we wish to acquire an n-dimensional signal x ∈ Rn using only m n measurements linear in x.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The measurements could potentially be noisy, but even in the absence of any noise we need to impose additional structure on the signal to guarantee unique recovery.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Classical results on compressed sensing impose structure by assuming the underlying signal to be approximately l-sparse in some known basis, i.e., the l-largest entries dominate the rest.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, images and audio signals are typically sparse in the wavelet and Fourier basis respectively (Mallat, 2008).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"If the matrix of linear vectors relating the signal and measurements satisfies certain mild conditions, then one can provably recover x with only m = O(l log nl ) measurements using LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996; Candès & Tao, 2005; Donoho, 2006; Candès et al., 2006; Bickel et al., 2009).

"Alternatively, structural assumptions on the signals being sensed can be learned from data, e.g., using a dataset of typical signals (Baraniuk et al., 2010; Peyre, 2010; Chen et al., 2010; Yu & Sapiro, 2011).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Particularly relevant to this work, Bora et al. (2017) proposed an approach where structure is provided by a deep generative model learned from data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"Consequently, the signal x is recovered by optimizing for a latent vector z that minimizes the `2 distance between the measurements corresponding to G(z) and the actual ones.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Even though the objective being optimized in this case is non-convex, empirical results suggest that the reconstruction error decreases much faster than LASSO-based recovery as we increase the number of measurements.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A limitation of the above approach is that the recovered signal is constrained to be in the range of the generator function G. Hence, if the true signal being sensed is not in the range of G, the algorithm cannot drive the reconstruction error to zero even when m ≥ n",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
(even if we ignore error due to measurement noise and non-convex optimization).,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is also observed empirically, as the reconstruction error of generative model-based recovery saturates as we keep
increasing the number of measurements m. On the other hand, LASSO-based recovery continues to shrink the error with increasing number of measurements, eventually outperforming the generative model-based recovery.

"The recovered signals have the general form of G(ẑ) + ν̂, where ν̂ ∈ Rn is a sparse vector.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This allows the recovery algorithm to consider signals away from the range of the generator function.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Similar to LASSO, we relax the hardness in optimizing for sparse vectors by minimizing the `1 norm of the deviations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"Define the least possible `1 error for recovering x under the Sparse-Gen modeling as,
σSl,G(x) = inf x̂∈Sl,G

Lemma 1.,4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
"Given a function G : Rk → Rn and measurement noise with ‖ ‖2 ≤ max, let A be any matrix that satisfies S-REC(S1.5l,G, (1− α), δ) and RIP(2l, α) for some α ∈ (0, 1), l > 0.",4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]

",4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
The above lemma shows that there exists a decoder such that the error in recovery can be upper bounded for measurement matrices satisfying S-REC and RIP.,4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
Note that Lemma 1 only guarantees the existence of such a decoder and does not prescribe an optimization algorithm for recovery.,4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
"Apart from the errors due to the bounded measurement noise max and a scaled slack term appearing in the S-REC condition δ′, the major term in the upper bound corresponds to (up to constants) the minimum possible error incurred by the best possible recovery vector in Sl,G given by σl,G(x).",4.

"Similar terms appear invariably in the compressed sensing literature and are directly related to the modeling assumptions regarding x (for example, Theorem 8.3 in Cohen et al. (2009)).

"From the above lemma, we see that the number of measurements needed to guarantee upper bounds on the reconstruction error of any signal with high probability depends on two terms.",4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
"The first term includes dependence on the Lipschitz constant L of the generative model function G. A high Lipschitz constant makes recovery harder (by requiring a larger
number of measurements), but only contributes logarithmically.",4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
"The second term, typical of results in sparse vector recovery, shows a logarithmic growth on the dimensionality n of the signals.",4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]

"Our theoretical analysis formalizes the key properties of recovering signals using Sparse-Gen. As shown in Lemma 1, there exists a decoder for recovery based on such modeling assumptions that extends recovery guarantees based on vanilla sparse vector recovery and generative model-based recovery.",4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
Such recovery requires measurement matrices that satisfy both the RIP and S-REC conditions over the set of vectors that deviate in sparse directions from the range of a generative model function.,4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
"In Theorems 1-2, we observed that the number of measurements required to guarantee recovery with high probability grow almost linearly (with some logarithmic terms) with the latent space dimensionality k of the generative model and the permissible sparsity l for deviating from the range of the generative model.",4.

"For all algorithms considered, recovery was performed by optimizing over a continuous space.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In the case of sparse recovery methods (including Sparse-Gen) it is possible that unconstrained optimization returns signals outside the domain of interest, in which case they are projected to the required domain by simple clipping, i.e., any signal less than zero is clipped to 0 and similarly any signal greater than one is clipped to 1.

The reconstruction errors for varying number of measurements are given in Figure 2.,5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Consistent with the theory, the strong prior in generative modelbased recovery methods outperforms the LASSO-based methods for sparse vector recovery.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In the regime of low measurements, the performance of algorithms that can incorporate the generative model prior dominates over methods modeling sparsity using LASSO.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The performance of plain generative model-based methods however saturates with increasing measurements, unlike Sparse-Gen and LASSO which continue to shrink the error.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The trends are consistent for both MNIST and Omniglot, although we observe the relative magnitudes of errors in the case of Omniglot are much higher than that of MNIST.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
This is expected due to the increased diversity and variations of the structure of the signals being sensed in the case of Omniglot.,5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
We also observe the trends to be consistent across the various norms considered.,5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]

"With only m = 100 measurements, all models perform poorly and generative model based methods particularly continue to sense images similar to MNIST.",5.1. Transfer compressed sensing,[0],[0]

"Since the introduction of compressed sensing over a decade ago, there has been a vast body of research studying various extensions and applications (Candès & Tao, 2005; Donoho,

Themes around sparsity in a well-chosen basis has driven much of the research in this direction.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For instance, the paradigm of model-based compressed sensing accounts for the interdependencies between the dimensions of a sparse data signal (Baraniuk et al., 2010; Duarte & Eldar, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2017).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, adaptive selection of basis vectors from a dictionary that best capture the structure of the particular signal being sensed has also been explored (Peyre, 2010; Tang et al., 2013).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Many of these methods have been extended to recovery of structured tensors (Zhang et al., 2013; 2014).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In another prominent line of research involving Bayesian compressed sensing, the sparseness assumption is formalized by placing sparsenesspromoting priors on the signals (Ji et al., 2008; He & Carin, 2009; Babacan et al., 2010; Baron et al., 2010).
