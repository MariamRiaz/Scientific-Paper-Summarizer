Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can memorize their training data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although practitioners have long been aware of this phenomenon, Zhang et al. (2017) recently brought attention to it by showing that standard SGD-based training on AlexNet gets close to zero training error on a modification of the ImageNet dataset even when the labels are randomly permuted.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This leads to an interesting question: If neural nets have sufficient capacity to memorize random training sets why do

they generalize on real data?,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A natural hypothesis is that nets behave differently on real data than on random data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Arpit et al. (2017) study this question experimentally and show that there are apparent differences in behavior.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"They conclude that generalization and memorization depend not just on the network architecture and optimization procedure but on the dataset itself.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"But what if networks fundamentally do not behave differently on real data than on random data, and, in both cases, are simply memorizing?",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This is a difficult question to explore for two reasons.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, it is hard to provide a direct answer.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Whereas it is easy to tell when a net is memorizing random data (the training error goes to zero!),1. Introduction,[0],[0]
", there is no easy way to tell when a network is memorizing real data as opposed to “learning”.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, and perhaps more importantly, it contradicts the intuitive notion—inherent in the preceding discussion—that memorization and generalization are at odds.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This work attempts to shed light on this second difficulty by investigating the following: How much can you learn if memorization is all you can do?,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Is generalization even possible in this setting?
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"At first, generalization in such a setting of pure memorization may seem hopeless: the simplest way to memorize would be to build a lookup table from the training data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although this approach works for special cases where the input population is finite and small, it fails in general since the examples seen during training are unlikely to match test examples.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
One way to get around this limitation is to use k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or any of its variants at test time.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While k-NNs work well on many problems, they fail on problems where it is not easy to construct a semantically meaningful distance function on the input space.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In such cases, the obvious syntactic distance functions (e.g., say Euclidean distance between images viewed as vectors in Rd) do not work well.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Indeed some of the most interesting results from deep learning have been the discovery—through learning—of semantically meaningful distance functions (via embeddings).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, in this work we do not allow ourselves a distance function.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead, we get around the problem by applying the notion of depth, which has been wildly successful in improving the performance of neural networks, to direct memorization.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We build a network of lookup tables (also
called “luts”) where the luts are arranged in successive layers much like a neural network.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, unlike a neural network, training happens through memorization and does not involve backpropagation, gradient descent, or any explicit search.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Now, since in contrast to a neuron, the function implemented by a lut can be arbitrarily complex, without some means to control the complexity, the notion of depth is vacuous.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We control the complexity of a function learned by a lut in the simplest possible way: we limit the support (and thereby the size) of the lut.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each lut in a layer receives inputs from only a few luts in the previous layer, which are picked at random when the network is constructed.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This kind of restriction on local function complexity is similar to what is found to work well in deep neural networks.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, a convolutional filter is obviously support-limited, and a fully connected layer although not support-limited is nevertheless limited in expressivity.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, the learned weight matrices in neural networks are often sparse or can be made so with no loss in accuracy (Han et al., 2015).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We need two restrictions before we can proceed to an algorithm.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, for simplicity, we focus our attention on binary classification problems.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, because lookup tables work naturally with discrete inputs, in this work we limit ourselves to discrete signals.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In fact, the inputs and all intermediate signals in the network of lookup tables are binary.",1. Introduction,[0.9512176824379353],"['In social media especially, there is a large diversity in terms of both the topic and language, necessitating the modeling of multiple languages simultaneously.']"
The restriction is not as extreme as it may appear.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"There are a number of results in quantized and binary neural networks showing that limited precision is often sufficient (e.g. Rastegari et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0.9505769245281401],"['Social media is filled with examples of code-switching, where users switch between two or more languages, both in a conversation and even a single message (Ling et al., 2013).']"
"Furthermore, even in real-valued neural networks, we need mechanisms such as convolution and pooling to ensure that certain types of small changes in the inputs (e.g., a small displacement) do not lead to large changes in output.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In principle, similar mechanisms could be used in a fully discrete setting to handle real-valued quantities.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"With these restrictions in place, we are now ready to proceed.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Let B = {0, 1} and consider the problem of learning a function f :",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Bk → B from a list of training examples where each example is an (x, y) pair.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Since we want to learn by memorizing, we construct a lookup table with 2k rows (one for each possible bit pattern p ∈",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Bk that can appear at the input) and two columns y0 and y1.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"The y0 entry for the row corresponding to pattern p (denoted by cp0) counts how many times p is associated with output 0 in the training set, i.e., the number of occurrences of (p, 0) in the training set.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Similarly, the y1 entry for row p (denoted by cp1) counts how many times the pattern p is associated with the output 1 in the training set, i.e., the number of occurrences of (p, 1)
in the training set.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Note that for a pattern p it is possible for both cp0 and cp1 to be greater than zero since due to Bayes error both (p, 0) and (p, 1) may be present in the training examples.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
It is also possible for both cp0 and cp1 to be zero if the input p never appears in the training examples.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"We call such a lookup table a k-input lookup table or a k-lut since the inputs are bit vectors of length k.1
Next, we associate a boolean function f̂ : Bk → B with the lookup table in the following manner:
f̂(p) =  1 if cp1 > cp0,0 if cp1 < cp0, b if cp1 = cp0
where b ∈ B is picked uniformly at random when fixing f̂ in order to break ties.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"In other words, f̂ maps an input p to the output that is most often associated with it in the training set (breaking ties randomly).",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"We say that f̂ is the function learned by the lookup table.
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Example 1.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Let k = 3 and consider learning a function f : B3 → B from 7 examples shown on the left below.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"The lookup table that we learn is shown in the middle, and the truth table of the learned function f̂ is shown on the right.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]

"This is the best we can do on this set of training examples because the Bayes error rate is non-zero.
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"If we measure training error as the average 0–1 loss on the training set, this procedure to learn f̂ has the following properties:
1.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Optimality.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"The learned function f̂ is Bayes-optimal on the training set, i.e., there is no function g :",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Bk → B with training error strictly less than that of f̂ .,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"In particular, the training error is zero iff the training set has zero Bayes error.

Monotonicity.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"If we have more information for each x in the training set, i.e., we augment each training

"The input bit vector (viewed as an integer) can be used to directly index into the table.
example with m extra bits of information (keeping the labels fixed) and use the above procedure to now learn a new function ĝ : Bk+m → B, then the training error of ĝ is no more than that of f̂ .
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Proof Sketch.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Optimality is easy to see since the total training error is the sum of the training error for each possible pattern p which is minimized by choosing the majority class for each p.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Monotonicity holds since if not, then we can compose the obvious projection Bk+m",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"→ Bk with f̂ to get a contradiction with the optimality of ĝ.
Note that monotonicity implies in particular that the training accuracy at the output of a lut is no worse than that at any of its inputs.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, as we make the luts larger, the training error cannot increase but only decrease.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
This is interesting since there are no restrictions on the m extra bits: they could be completely non-informative.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"These properties will prove useful in the next section as we consider networks of luts.
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"To summarize, the procedure described to learn a single lookup table in this section is essentially memorization in the presence of Bayes error, where the idea is to simply remember the output that is most commonly associated with an input in the training set.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Now consider a binary classification task on MNIST (LeCun & Cortes, 2010) of separating the digits ‘0’ through ‘4’ (we map these to the 0 class) from the digits ‘5’ through ‘9’ (the 1 class) where the pixels are 1-bit quantized.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Thus the task is to learn a function f : B28×28 → B. We call this the Binary-MNIST task (overloading binary here to mean both binary classification and binary inputs).
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"In principle, we could use the procedure in Section 2 to learn this function.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"However, since we have only 60,000 training examples in MNIST, most of the 228×28 rows in the lookup table would have 0 entries in both columns, and hence the function learned would be mostly random and have very poor generalization to inputs outside the training set.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"As discussed in the introduction, we get around this problem by introducing depth.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Instead of learning a giant lookup table with 228×28 entries, we learn a network of (much) smaller lookup tables.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The network consists of d layers with each layer l (1 ≤ l ≤ d) having nl k-input lookup tables.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Each lut in first layer (l = 1) receives its inputs from a krandom subset of the network inputs.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
A lut in a layer,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
l > 1 receives inputs from a k-random subset of the luts in layer l − 1.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The connectivity is fixed at network creation time and does not change during training or inference.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The final layer of the network has a single lookup table (i.e., nd = 1) which is the output of the network.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"By analogy with neural
networks, we call the final layer the output layer and the other layers hidden layers.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"We train the lookup tables layer by layer, where the target of each lookup table is the final output.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
We start from the first layer and work our way to the output.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Once a layer has been learned, we use the functions associated with its luts (the f̂s of Section 2) to map its inputs to outputs.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"These outputs serve as the inputs for the next layer, which is learned next.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Continuing our analogy with neural networks, we call the output values of a layer activations.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Inference is similar to training: We start from the inputs and evaluate each layer in order using the functions learned at each lut to map inputs to outputs.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Example 2.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
We modify Example 1.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Instead of learning a single lut with k = 3 inputs, we learn a network of k = 2 luts.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The network shown in Figure 1 has d = 2 layers.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The first layer has 2 luts (i.e., n1 = 2) which are connected to inputs x0 and x1 of the network.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The second layer (which is also the output layer) has 1 lut (i.e., n2 = 1) which is connected to the outputs of the two luts in the first layer.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
(The connections were made randomly when the network was created.),3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Using the procedure in Section 2, the two lookup tables learned in the first layer (using y as the target) along with their corresponding functions f̂10 and f̂11 are:
p x0x1
y0 y1 f̂10
00 1 3 1 01 0 0 1∗ 10 1 0 0 11 1 1 1∗
p x0x2
y0 y1 f̂11
00 1 2 1 01 0 1 1 10 2 1 0 11 0 0 1∗
Let the output of the luts in the first layer be w10 and w11, i.e., w10 = f̂10(x0x1) and w11 = f̂11(x0x2).",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The learning problem for the lut in the second layer is shown in the tables below.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"For convenience, on the left we show the primary inputs x0, x1 and x2, the first layer activations w10 and w11 (which are the inputs of the lut), and the target output y.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"On the right we show the table and the learned function f̂20:
x x0x1x2
w10w11 y
000 11 0 000 11 1 000 11 1 001 11 1 100 00 0 110 10 0 110 10 1
p w10w11
y0 y1 f̂20
00 1 0 0 01 0 0 1∗ 10 1 1 0∗ 11 1 3 1
In this case the function implemented by the network of 2-luts has the same performance on the training set as the function learned by the 3-lut in Example 1.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Since there are fewer possible patterns in the case of smaller luts, we expect better pattern coverage during training and hence better generalization.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Implementation.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The memorization procedure described here is linear in the size of the training data, requiring two passes over the training set.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
It is computationally efficient since it only involves counting and dense table lookups and does not require floating point.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"It is also easy to parallelize since each lut in a given layer is independent, and the counts can be computed on disjoint subsets of the training data and then combined (using, for example, a reduction tree).",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Note that using this property it is possible to execute the algorithm on extremely large datasets where all the training examples may not fit on a single machine with only the summary statistics of the data (the counts in the lookup tables) being exchanged across machines.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Experiment 1.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In the first experiment, we apply the above procedure to the Binary-MNIST task (as defined in Section 3) to see if this approach to memorization can generalize.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For this experiment, we construct a network with 5 hidden layers of 1024 luts and 1 lut in the output layer.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We set k = 8, i.e., each lut in the network takes 8 inputs.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The network achieves a training accuracy of 0.89 on this task, which is perhaps not so surprising since we are memorizing the training data after all.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"But what is surprising is that the network achieves an accuracy of 0.87 on a heldout set (the 10,000 test images in MNIST) which indicates generalization.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This result is not state-of-the-art on this variant of MNIST (see Experiment 4), but that is not the point.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"It is significantly above the 0.5 accuracy that would be expected by chance, and this is achieved by an algorithm that only memorizes and performs no explicit search.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The training and test accuracies are stable: there is very little variation from run to run.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In other words, very little depends on the actual random choices made when deciding the topology of the network.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To understand why this is
the case, we look at training accuracies of the luts in the network.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Since the target for each lut in the network is the final classification target, we can examine the accuracy of a lut as a function of its layer.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the accuracies of luts in each layer.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
We observe that as depth increases the average accuracy of the luts in a layer goes up.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In other words, depth helps.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Some intuition for this is provided by the monotonicity property of the luts: the output of a lut cannot have lower accuracy than any of its inputs (Section 2).
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we observe in Table 1 the dispersion in accuracy across the luts (measured either by standard deviation (std) or the difference between max and min) goes down.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Therefore, as depth increases the specifics of the connectivity matters less and the network automatically becomes more stable with respect to the random choices made during construction.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Indeed we can say something stronger: we have seen in our experiments (not shown in Table 1) that as depth increases the activations of the luts in a layer become more correlated with each other, and hence become more interchangeable.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"While this correlation is good for stability with respect to connectivity, it causes diminishing returns with additional depth.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Remark.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The perceptive reader looking at Table 1 will also notice that we are wasting computation: the single output lut in layer 6 receives input from only 8 of the 1024 luts in layer 5 and these in turn can at most receive inputs from 64 luts from layer 4.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Although a different topology would be more computationally efficient, this specific choice allows us to compare the different layers more easily.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We have not optimized this aspect since it typically takes less than 30 seconds using a single threaded unoptimized implementation (Python with NumPy) to run an experiment.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As discussed in the introduction and in Section 3, we do not expect unbridled memorization in the form of a large lookup table (say k = 28 × 28 in the case of Binary-MNIST) to generalize at all.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This motivated our
exploration of a network of smaller lookup tables parameterized by k (the number of inputs of each lut).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
We now vary k to see if we can control the amount of memorization and to see the effect it has on generalization.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To avoid changing too much at once, we keep the number of layers and the number of luts per layer the same as in Experiment 1.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The results are shown in the first 3 columns of Table 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"With small values of k, the network finds it difficult to memorize the training data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As intuitively expected (see also the monotonicity property in Section 2), as k increases the training accuracy goes up with perfect memorization at k = 14, i.e., long before 28×28.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, larger luts generalize less well, and the best test accuracy of 0.90 is achieved at k = 12 though with substantially good memorization of the training data (0.99).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, there is a clear monotonic increase in the generalization gap measured as the difference between training and test accuracy with increasing k.
Experiment 3.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
In this experiment—along the lines of those performed in Zhang et al. (2017)—we randomly permute the labels in the training set and repeat Experiment 2 on this “random” dataset.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The results are shown in columns 4 and 5 of Table 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As expected, with increasing k the network gets better at memorizing the training data, and the test accuracy hovers around chance (0.5) though with significant variation (± 0.05).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This may be viewed as empirical evidence that the Rademacher complexity goes up with k.
However, and this may be surprising for a pure memorization algorithm, memorizing random data turns out to be harder than memorizing real data (columns 2 and 3 of Table 2) in the sense that a larger k is required to get the same accuracy with random data than with real data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For example, it takes until k = 12 to get comparable training accuracy on random data as k = 4 gets on real data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This result corroborates the findings in Arpit et al. (2017, §3 and §4) that real data is easier to fit than random data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
But it also means that we cannot conclude that any such difference observed in neural networks is because they do not use brute force memorization on real data.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As this experiment shows, such
differences can appear even with brute force memorization.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, at k = 12 we have a network that is able to memorize random data (random training accuracy of 0.82) and yet generalizes to test data when trained on real data (real test accuracy of 0.90).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is very similar to findings of Zhang et al. (2017) in the context of neural networks.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Kawaguchi et al. (2017, §3) argue that this phenomenon is universal and our result may be viewed as further empirical evidence for their claim showing that this phenomenon can happen even in the simplified setting of just memorization.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 4.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For completeness, we compare memorization with several standard methods and the results are shown in Table 3.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
We have not specifically tuned the other methods since our goal is not to beat the state-of-the-art but to get a sense of how memorization alone does when compared to the standard methods.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The best performance is obtained by a LENET-style convolutional network with 2 convolutions (64 and 32 filters respectively) each followed by a corresponding max pool layer, and 3 fully connected layers (256, 128 and 2 units respectively) with softmax output.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The net is trained for 6 epochs with stochastic gradient descent and dropout.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Once again, compared to random guessing which has 0.50 test accuracy, memorization does quite well with a test accuracy of 0.90 (using the k = 12 configuration from Experiment 2) and beats logistic regression and naı̈ve Bayes.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, 1- and 5-Nearest Neighbors do well too (test accuracy of 0.97) though recall that they are provided with a distance function which memorization does not have access to and must in a sense discover.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 5.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We now consider the task of separating the i-th digit in MNIST from the j-th digit, which gives us( 10 2 ) = 45 binary classification tasks, which we collectively call Pairwise-MNIST.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The images are binarized as before.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows the training accuracy and the test accuracy for each of those 45 experiments for 8 different values of k.
As in Experiment 2, we find that as k increases, the training accuracy increases (reaching 1.0), but the test accuracy falls off.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"If we look at the best test accuracies for a given task (across k), on 31 out of the 45 tasks, we do better than 0.98.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The worst of these is 0.95 which is the best memorization can do for separating ‘4’ and ‘9’.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is still significantly better than the 0.5 we would expect by chance.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Typically the best test accuracies are achieved at k = 6 and k = 8.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 6.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
In Experiment 5 we notice that the variation is quite high for k = 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
This indicates that the depth of the network is insufficient for proper mixing.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To investigate this further, we keep k = 2 and vary the number of hidden layers from 20 to 25.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Each hidden layer still has 1024 luts.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows how the training and test accuracies vary with the depth of the network.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"It is interesting to note that the test accuracy continues to improve even for relatively deep networks (16 or 32 hidden layers), and we get very high test accuracies even with such small lookup tables.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we note that the variation in the generalization error (difference between training and test accuracies) decreases with increasing depth.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 7.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Next we look at memorization on CIFAR-10 which is a collection of 32 pixel by 32 pixel color images belonging to 10 classes.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As with Binary-MNIST, we quantize each color channel to 1 bit and try to separate the classes 0 through 4 from classes 5 through 9.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This gives us the Binary-CIFAR-10 task where we have to learn a function f : B3×32×32 → B from 50,000 images.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Incidentally, the quantization of each color channel to 1-bit significantly degrades the signal making it a difficult task for humans.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]

"For the same reason we don’t explore data augmentation here which is a standard technique for CIFAR-10.

"Normalization For the normalization task, we use a total of 44 texts from the Anselm corpus (Dipper and Schultz-Balluff, 2013) of Early New High German.1",2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The corpus is a collection of manuscripts and prints of the same core text, a religious treatise.",2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Although the texts are semi-parallel and share some vocabulary, they were written in different time periods (between the 14th and 16th century) as well as different dialectal regions, and show quite diverse spelling characteristics.",2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"For example, the modern German word Frau ‘woman’ can be spelled as fraw/vraw (Me), frawe (N2), frauwe (St), fraüwe (B2), frow (Stu), vrowe (Ka), vorwe (Sa), or vrouwe (B), among others.2

"We propose several architectures that are extensions of a base neural network architecture, closely following the sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Sutskever et al. (2014).",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"It consists of the following:
• an embedding layer that maps one-hot input vectors to dense vectors;
• an encoder RNN that transforms the input sequence to an intermediate vector of fixed dimensionality;
• a decoder RNN whose hidden state is initialized with the intermediate vector, and which is fed the output prediction of one timestep as the input for the next one; and
• a final dense layer with a softmax activation which takes the decoder’s output and generates a probability distribution over the output classes at each timestep.

"For the encoder/decoder RNNs, we use long short-term memory units (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"LSTMs are designed to allow recurrent networks to better learn long-term dependencies, and have proven advantageous to standard RNNs on many tasks.",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"We found no significant advantage from stacking multiple LSTM layers for our task, so we use the simplest competitive model with only a single LSTM unit for both encoder and decoder.

"By using this encoder–decoder model, we avoid the need to generate explicit alignments between the input and output sequences, which would bring up the question of how to deal with input/output
pairs of different lengths.",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"Another important property is that the model does not start to generate any output until it has seen the full input sequence, which in theory allows it to learn from any part of the input, without being restricted to fixed context windows.",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
An example illustration of the unrolled network is shown in Fig. 1.,3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"During training, the encoder inputs are the historical wordforms, while the decoder inputs correspond to the correct modern target wordforms.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"We then train each model by minimizing the crossentropy loss across all output characters; i.e., if y = (y1, ..., yn) is the correct output word (as a list of one-hot vectors of output characters) and ŷ",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"= (ŷ1, ..., ŷn) is the model’s output, we minimize the mean loss−∑ni=1 yi log ŷi over all training samples.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"For the optimization, we use the Adam algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 0.003.
",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"To reduce computational complexity, we also set a maximum word length of 14, and filter all training samples where either the input or output word is longer than 14 characters.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"This only affects 172 samples across the whole dataset, and is only done during training.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"In other words, we evaluate our models across all the test examples.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"For prediction, our base model generates output character sequences in a greedy fashion, selecting the character with the highest probability at each timestep.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"This works fairly well, but the greedy approach can yield suboptimal global picks, in which each individual character is sensibly derived from the input, but the overall word is non-
sensical.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"We therefore also experiment with beam search decoding, setting the beam size to 5.
",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"Finally, we also experiment with using a lexical filter during the decoding step.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"Here, before picking the next 5 most likely characters during beam search, we remove all characters that would lead to a string not covered by the lexicon.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
This is again intended to reduce the occurrence of nonsensical outputs.,3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]

"This is a strong assumption, especially with long input sequences.",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
Attention mechanisms give us more flexibility.,3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"The idea is that instead of encoding the entire input sequence into a fixedlength vector, we allow the decoder to “attend” to different parts of the input character sequence at each time step of the output generation.",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"Importantly, we let the model learn what to attend to based on the input sequence and what it has produced so far.

Our implementation is identical to the decoder with soft attention described by Xu et al. (2015).,3.4 Attention,[0],[0]

"In Eq. 3, we follow the traditional LSTM description consisting of input gate it, forget gate ft, output gate ot, cell state ct and hidden state ht, where W and b are trainable parameters.
",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"For all experiments including an attentional decoder, we use a bi-directional encoder, comprised of one LSTM layer that reads the input sequence normally and another LSTM layer that reads it backwards, and attend over the concatenated outputs of these two layers.

"While a precise alignment of input and output sequences is sometimes difficult, most of the time the sequences align in a sequential order, which can be exploited by an attentional component.",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"Finally, we introduce a variant of the base architecture, with or without beam search, that does multi-task learning (Caruana, 1993).",3.5 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"The multitask architecture only differs from the base architecture in having two classifier functions at the outer layer, one for each of our two tasks.",3.5 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]

Baselines We compare our architectures to several competitive baselines.,4 Evaluation,[0],[0]

deep bi-LSTM sequential tagger, following Bollmann and Søgaard (2016).",4 Evaluation,[0],[0]

"Finally, we compare our model to the rule-based and Levenshtein-based algorithms provided by the Norma tool (Bollmann, 2012).4",4 Evaluation,[0],[0]
We use word-level accuracy as our evaluation metric.,4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]
"While we also measure character-level metrics, minor differences on character level can cause large differences in downstream applications, so we believe that perfectly matching the output sequences is more useful.",4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]
"Average scores across all 43 texts are presented in Table 1 (see Appendix A for individual scores).

",4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]
"We hypothesize that the reason for this pattern, which is not only observed in the average scores in Table 1, but also quite consistent across the individual results in Appendix A, is that our multi-task learning already learns how to focus attention.

"This is the hypothesis that we will try to validate in Sec. 5: That multi-task learning can induce strategies for focusing attention comparable to attention strategies for recurrent neural networks.

Sample predictions A small selection of predictions from our models is shown in Table 2.,4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]
"They serve to illustrate the effects of the various settings; e.g., the base model with greedy search tends to produce more nonsense words (ters, ünsget) than the others.",4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]

only the models with attention or multi-task learning produce the correct normalization, but even when they are wrong, they often agree on the prediction (e.g. dicke, herzel).",4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]

Fig. 2 shows the learned character embeddings.,4.2 Learned vector representations,[0],[0]
"In the representations from the base model (Fig. 2a), characters that are often normalized to the same target character are indeed grouped closely together: e.g., historical <v> and <u> (and, to a smaller extent, <f>) are often used interchangeably in the M4 text.",4.2 Learned vector representations,[0],[0]

"and <m>, which is a feature of M4 that does not hold true for all of the texts, as these do not always display a clear distinction between nasals.",4.2 Learned vector representations,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the MTL model shows a better generalization of the training data (Fig. 2b): here, <u> is grouped closer to other vowel characters and far away from <v>/<f>.",4.2 Learned vector representations,[0],[0]

Table 1 shows that models which employ either an attention mechanism or multi-task learning obtain similar improvements in word accuracy.,5 Analysis: Multi-task learning helps focus attention,[0],[0]
"However, we observe a decline in word accuracy for models that combine multi-task learning with attention.
",5 Analysis: Multi-task learning helps focus attention,[0],[0]
"A possible interpretation of this counterintuitive pattern might be that attention and MTL, to some degree, learn similar functions of the input data, a conjecture by Caruana (1998).",5 Analysis: Multi-task learning helps focus attention,[0],[0]
We put this hypothesis to the test by closely investigating properties of the individual models below.,5 Analysis: Multi-task learning helps focus attention,[0],[0]
"First, we are interested in the weight parameters of the final layer that transforms the decoder output to class probabilities.",5.1 Model parameters,[0],[0]
"We consider these parameters for our standard encoder-decoder model and compare them to the weights that are learned by the attention and multi-task models, respectively.5
Note that hidden layer parameters are not necessarily comparable across models, but with a fixed seed, differences in parameters over a reference model may be (and are, in our case).",5.1 Model parameters,[0],[0]
"With a fixed seed, and iterating over data points in the same order, it is conceivable the two non-baselines end up in roughly the same alternative local optimum (or at least take comparable routes).
",5.1 Model parameters,[0],[0]
"We observe that the weight differences between the standard and the attention model correlate with the differences between the standard and multitask model by a Pearson’s r of 0.346, averaged across datasets, with a standard deviation of 0.315; on individual datasets, correlation coefficient is as

Figure 4 illustrates these highly parallel weight changes for the different models when trained on the N4 dataset.,5.1 Model parameters,[0],[0]
"Next, we compare the effect that employing either an attention mechanism or multi-task learning has on the actual output of our system.",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"We find that out of the 210.9 word errors that the base model produces on average across all test sets (comprising 1,000 tokens each), attention resolves 47.7, while multi-task learning resolves an average of 45.4 errors.",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"Crucially, the overlap of errors that are resolved by both the attention and the MTL model amounts to 27.7 on average.
",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"Attention and multi-task also introduce new errors compared to the base model (26.6 and 29.5 per test set, respectively), and again we can observe a relatively high agreement of the models (11.8 word errors are introduced by both models).
",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"Finally, the attention and multi-task models display a word-level agreement of κ=0.834 (Cohen’s kappa), while either of these models is less strongly correlated with the base model (κ=0.817 for attention and κ=0.814 for multi-task learning).",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
Our last analysis regards the saliency of the input timesteps with respect to the predictions of our models.,5.3 Saliency analysis,[0],[0]
We follow Li et al. (2016) in calculating first-derivative saliency for given input/output pairs and compare the scores from the different models.,5.3 Saliency analysis,[0],[0]
"The higher the saliency of an input timestep, the more important it is in determining the model’s prediction at a given output timestep.",5.3 Saliency analysis,[0],[0]
"Therefore, if two models produce similar saliency
matrices for a given input/output pair, they have learned to focus on similar parts of the input during the prediction.",5.3 Saliency analysis,[0],[0]
"Our hypothesis is that the attentional and the multi-task learning model should be more similar in terms of saliency scores than either of them compared to the base model.

"We minimize this loss averaged across the training samples, to learn the various model parameters using stochastic gradient descent (Bottou, 2012).",3.1 Vanilla Model,[0],[0]
"The final prediction y, now includes information from both dataset specific samples and world knowledge to aid in en-
hanced performance.",3.1 Vanilla Model,[0],[0]
While jointly training the attention mechanism tunes itself to retrieve relevant facts that are required to do the final classification.,3.1 Vanilla Model,[0],[0]
The vanilla model attends over the entire entity/relation space which is not a good approach as we observe that the gradient for each attention value gets saturated easily.,3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"While training the classification and retrieval module together, the model tends to ignore the KG part and gradient propagates only through the classification module.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"This is expected to an extent as the most pertinent information for the task at hand comes from the training samples, only background aiding information comes from KG.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"After few epochs of training, the KG retrieved fact always converged to a fixed vector.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"To overcome this problem, we attempted pretraining KG retrieval part separately.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"A pre-trained KG model is used to retrieve the facts and then concatenate with the classification module, while we allow error to be propagate through the pretrained model, at the time of joint training.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
We infer that KG doesn’t return noise and has essential information for the task as the separate KG part alone shows significant performance (59% for News20 & 66% for SNLI).,3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
Figure 3 depicts the entire training scheme.,3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"This procedure solved the issue of gradient saturation in the KG retrieval part
at the time of joint training.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"However, the key problem of attention mechanism having to cover a large span of entities/relation, remained.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"In this section, we propose a mechanism to reduce the large number of entities/relationships over which attention has to be generated in the knowledge graph.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"We propose to reduce the attention space by learning the representation of similar entity/relation vectors and attending over them.
",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"In order to cluster similar entity/relation vectors, we used k-means clustering (Bishop, 2006) and formed l clusters with equal number of entity/relation vectors in each cluster.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
Each of the clusters were then encoded using convolutional filters.,3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"The output of the k-means clustering is a sequence of entity/relation vectors {eT1 , eT2 , · · · , eTq }, where ei ∈ Rm.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"For each cluster these vectors were stacked to form E as the 2- D input to the CNN encoder, where E ∈ Rm×q.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"During experimentation for finding a suitable fil-
ter shape, it was observed that using 2-D filters the model failed to converge at all.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we inferred that the latent representation of two different indices in the vector ei, should not be tampered using convolution.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]

"A pooling layer followed the convolution layer in order to reduce the parameter space, we used 1-D window only along the y-axis similar to the convolutional kernel mentioned above.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"We used a two layered convolution network with the stride length k & max-pool windows n is adjusted to obtain output Ei ∈ Rm, where i is the cluster index.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
Similar procedure of clustering followed by the encoding of the cluster entities is done for relations as well.,3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"Thus both the entity and relation space were reduced to contain fewer elements, one each for each cluster.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"After the compact entity space E and relation space R is formed, we followed the same steps as earlier for forming the attention, but now the training was more effective as the gradient was propagating effectively and was not choked by the large space.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"As the convolution architecture is also simultaneously trained, attention mechanism was not burdened as before, to learn over the large space of entities and relations.
",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"Another point that needs to be mentioned here is regarding ranking/ordering items in the clusters, we have done experiments to verify the ordering does not affect the final result.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"We have verified this by randomly shuffling the entities/relationships in every clusters and the ac-
curacy output remained within an error bound of ±0.5%.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"In various permutations, the representations learned by the convolution operator for clusters varies, but it does not affect the overall results.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"Regarding the interpretation of what convolution operator learns, the operator is applied along each dimension of the entity/relationship vector, to learn a representation of the clusters.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"This representation includes information from relevant entities in the cluster, as the relevant entities varies across tasks, the representation learned using convolution also adapts accordingly.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"It is analogous to learning relevant features from an image, in our case the convolution layer learns the features focusing on relevant entities/relations in a cluster pertaining to the task.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
Our experiments were designed to analyze whether a deep learning model is being improved when it has access to KG facts from a relevant source.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"The selection of knowledge graph has to be pertinent to the task at hand, as currently there is no single knowledge base that contains multiple kinds of information and can cater to all tasks.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
We illustrate with results that the performance of a deep learning model improves when it has access to relevant facts.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"We also illustrate that as the model learns faster with access to knowledge bases, we can train deep learning models with substantially less training data, without compromising on the accuracy.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"In the subsequent section we briefly describe the datasets and associated Knowledge Bases used.
Datasets and Relevant Knowledge Graphs
In our experiments, we have mainly used the popular text classification dataset 20Newsgroups (Lichman, 2013) and the Natural Language Inference dataset, Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (Bowman et al., 2015).",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"We have also done experiments on DBPedia ontology classification dataset1, with a very strong baseline.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"These datasets are chosen as they share domain knowledge with two most popular knowledge bases, Freebase (FB15k) (Bollacker et al., 2008) and WordNet (WN18) (Bordes et al., 2013).",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"The training and test size of the datasets are mentioned in Table 1.
1http://wiki.dbpedia.org/ services-resources/dbpedia-data-set-2014
Freebase (FB15k) (Bollacker et al., 2008) contains facts about people, places and things (contains 14904 entities, 1345 relations & 4.9M fact triples), which is useful for text classification in 20Newsgroups (Lichman, 2013) dataset.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, WordNet (WN18) (Bordes et al., 2013) (has 40943 entities, 18 relations & 1.5M fact triples) contains facts about common day-to-day things (example: furniture includes bed), which can help in inference tasks like SNLI.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Both the knowledge bases are directed graphs, due to fewer number of relations WN18 the entities are more likely to be connected using the same type of relations.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
For experiments relating to both the datasets 20Newsgroups & SNLI we used the standard LSTM as the classification module.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"As iterated earlier, our KG based fact retrieval is independent of the base model used.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
We show improvement in performance using the proposed models by KG fact retrieval.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
We use classification accuracy of the test set as our evaluation metric.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
All experiments were carried on a Dell Precision Tower 7910 server with Quadro M5000 GPU with 8 GB of memory.,4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The models were trained using the Adam’s Optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) in a stochastic gradient descent (Bottou, 2012) fashion.",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The models were implemented using TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015).",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The relevant hyperparameters are listed in Table 2.,4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The word embeddings for the experiments were obtained using the pre-trained GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)2 vectors.",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"For words missing in the pre-trained vectors, the local GloVe vectors which was trained on the corresponding dataset was used.",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows the results of test accuracy of the various methods proposed on the datasets News20 & SNLI.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"We observe that incorporation of KG facts using the basic vanilla model improves the performance slightly, as the retrieval model was

not getting trained effectively.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
The convolutionbased model shows significant improvement over the normal LSTM classification.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
While tuning the parameters of the convolution for clustered entities/relations it was observed that smaller stride length and longer max-pool window improved performance.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"For News20 dataset we show an improvement of almost 3% and for SNLI an improvement of almost 5%.
",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
The work is motivated more from the perspective of whether incorporation of world knowledge will improve any deep learning model rather than beating the state-of-the-art performance.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"Although LSTM is used to encode the input for the model as well as the retrieval vector, as mentioned earlier, these two modules need not be same.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
For encoding the input any complex state-of-the-art model can be used.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
LSTM has also been used to generate the retrieval vector.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"For DBPedia ontology classification dataset, we have used a strong baseline of 98.6%, and after augmenting it with KG (Freebase) using convolution based model we saw an improvement of ∼0.2%.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"As the baseline is stronger, the improvement quantum has decreased.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
This is quite intuitive as complex models are selfsufficient in learning from the data by itself and therefore the room available for further improvement is relatively less.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"The improvement as observed in the experiments is significant in weaker learning models, however it is also capable of improving stronger baselines as is evident from the results of DBPedia dataset.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"We hypothesized that as Knowledge Graph is feeding more information to the model, we can achieve better performance with less training data.
",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
To verify this we have performed experiments on varying dataset fractions for 20Newsgroups dataset as shown in Figure 5.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"From the plot, we observe that KG augmented LSTM with 70% data outperforms the baseline model with full dataset support, thereby reducing the dependency on labeled data by 30%.
",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
We also designed an experiment to compare the accuracy of the baseline model trained on full training data and compared it with the accuracy of the KG augmented model trained with just 70% of the training data for 20Newsgroups and SNLI datasets.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
The accuracy and training loss plots across training epochs is given in Figure 6.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"Even with just 70% of the data, KG augmented model is able to achieve better accuracy compared to the vanilla LSTM model trained on the full data.",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
This clearly indicates that relevant information pertaining to the task is retrieved from the knowledge graph and the training loss reduction is not due to lesser data only.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
Also note that training loss is substantially less for KG LSTM compared to normal LSTM when the dataset size is reduced.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"This result is very promising, to reduce the large labeled training data requirement of large deep learning
models, which is hard to come by.",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"The basic idea of infusing general world knowledge for learning tasks, especially for natural language processing, has not been attempted before.",5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]
"For multi-label image classification, the use of KGs has been pursued recently by (Marino et al., 2016).",5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]

",5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]
In Transfer Learning the focus is on training the model for one task and tuning the trained model to use it for another task.,5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]
This is heavily dependent on the alignment between source task and destination task and transferred information is in the model.,5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]

A more sophisticated model which is able to retrieve facts more efficiently from millions of entries can be formulated.,6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]
"Currently we have focused only on a flat attention structure, a hierarchical attention mechanism would be more suitable.",6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]
The model uses soft attention to enable training by simple stochastic gradient descent.,6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]
Hard attention over facts using reinforcement learning can be pursued further.,6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]

"The convolution based model, helped to reduce the space over entities and relationships over which attention had to be generated.",6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]

Multilingual word embeddings have attracted a lot of attention in recent times.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to having a direct application in inherently crosslingual tasks like machine translation (Zou et al., 2013) and crosslingual entity linking (Tsai and Roth, 2016), they provide an excellent mechanism for transfer learning, where a model trained in a resource-rich language is transferred to a less-resourced one, as shown with part-of-speech tagging (Zhang et al., 2016), parsing (Xiao and Guo, 2014) and document classification (Klementiev et al., 2012).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most methods to learn these multilingual word embeddings make use of large parallel corpora (Gouws et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015), but there have been several proposals to relax this requirement, given its scarcity in most language pairs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A possible relaxation is to use document-aligned or label-aligned comparable corpora (Søgaard et al.,
2015; Vulić and Moens, 2016; Mogadala and Rettinger, 2016), but large amounts of such corpora are not always available for some language pairs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An alternative approach that we follow here is to independently train the embeddings for each language on monolingual corpora, and then learn a linear transformation to map the embeddings from one space into the other by minimizing the distances in a bilingual dictionary, usually in the range of a few thousand entries (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Artetxe et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, dictionaries of that size are not readily available for many language pairs, specially those involving less-resourced languages.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we reduce the need of large bilingual dictionaries to much smaller seed dictionaries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our method can work with as little as 25 word pairs, which are straightforward to obtain assuming some basic knowledge of the languages involved.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The method can also work with trivially generated seed dictionaries of numerals (i.e. 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4...) making it possible to learn bilingual word embeddings without any real bilingual data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In either case, we obtain very competitive results, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods that make use of much richer bilingual resources.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The proposed method is an extension of existing mapping techniques, where the dictionary is used to learn the embedding mapping and the embedding mapping is used to induce a new dictionary iteratively in a self-learning fashion (see Figure 1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"The first of such methods is due to Mikolov et al. (2013a), who learn the linear transformation that minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances for the dictionary entries.",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"The same optimization objective is used by Zhang et al. (2016), who constrain the transformation matrix to be orthogonal.",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]

"Instead of learning a single linear transformation from the source language into the target language, Faruqui and Dyer (2014) use canonical correlation analysis to map both languages to a shared vector space.",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"Lu et al. (2015) extend this work and apply deep canonical correlation analysis to learn non-linear transformations.
",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"Artetxe et al. (2016) propose a general framework that clarifies the relation between Mikolov et al. (2013a), Xing et al. (2015), Faruqui and Dyer (2014) and Zhang et al. (2016) as variants of the
same core optimization objective, and show that a new variant is able to surpass them all.",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"While most of the previous methods use gradient descent, Artetxe et al. (2016) propose an efficient analytical implementation for those same methods, recently extended by Smith et al. (2017) to incorporate dimensionality reduction.
",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"A prominent application of bilingual embedding mappings, with a direct application in machine translation (Zhao et al., 2015), is bilingual lexicon extraction, which is also the main evaluation method.",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"More specifically, the learned mapping is used to induce the translation of source language words that were missing in the original dictionary, usually by taking their nearest neighbor word in the target language according to cosine similarity, although Dinu et al. (2015) and Smith et al. (2017) propose alternative retrieval methods to address the hubness problem.",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"As mentioned before, our method works with as little as 25 word pairs, while the methods discussed previously use thousands of pairs.",2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]
"The only exception in this regard is the work by Zhang et al. (2016), who only use 10 word pairs with good results on transfer learning for part-of-speech tagging.",2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]

A practical aspect for reducing the need of bilingual supervision is on the design of the seed dictionary.,2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]
"This is analyzed in depth by Vulić and Korhonen (2016), who propose using documentaligned corpora to extract the training dictionary.",2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]
"A more common approach is to rely on shared words and cognates (Peirsman and Padó, 2010; Smith et al., 2017), eliminating the need of bilingual data in practice.",2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]
"Our use of shared numerals exploits the same underlying idea, but relies on even less bilingual evidence and should thus generalize better to distant language pairs.

Miceli Barone (2016) and Cao et al. (2016) go one step further and attempt to learn bilingual embeddings without any bilingual evidence.,2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]
"The former uses adversarial autoencoders (Makhzani et al., 2016), combining an encoder that maps the source language embeddings into the target language, a decoder that reconstructs the original embeddings, and a discriminator that distinguishes mapped embeddings from real target language embeddings, whereas the latter adds a regularization term to the training of word embeddings that pushes the mean and variance of each dimension in different languages close to each other.",2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]
"Although promising, the reported performance in both cases is poor in comparison to other methods.

"First of all, by enclosing the learning logic in a loop, the total training time is increased by the number of iterations.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"Even more importantly, our framework requires to explicitly build the entire dictionary at each iteration, whereas previous work tends to induce the translation of individual words ondemand later at runtime.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"Moreover, from the second iteration onwards, it is this induced, full dictionary that has to be used to learn the embedding mapping, and not the considerably smaller seed dictionary as it is typically done.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"In the following two subsections, we respectively describe the embedding mapping method and the dictionary in-
duction method that we adopt in our work with these efficiency requirements in mind.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]

"We next present their method, adapting the formalization to explicitly incorporate the dictionary as required by our self-learning algorithm.

Let X and Z denote the word embedding matrices in two languages so that Xi∗ corresponds to the ith source language word embedding and Zj∗ corresponds to the jth target language embedding.,3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
"While Artetxe et al. (2016) assume these two matrices are aligned according to the dictionary, we drop this assumption and represent the dictionary explicitly as a binary matrix D, so that Dij = 1 if the ith source language word is aligned with the jth target language word.",3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
The goal is then to find the optimal mapping matrix W ∗ so that the sum of squared Euclidean distances between the mapped source embeddings Xi∗W and target embeddings Zj∗,3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]

"The embeddings were trained with the word2vec toolkit with CBOW and negative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2013b)3, using a 2.8 billion word corpus for English (ukWaC + Wikipedia + BNC) and a 1.6 billion word corpus for Italian (itWaC).",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"The training and test sets were derived from a dictionary built form Europarl word alignments and available at OPUS (Tiedemann, 2012), taking 1,500 random entries uniformly distributed in 5 frequency bins as the test set and the 5,000 most frequent of the remaining word pairs as the training set.
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In addition to English-Italian, we selected two other languages from different language families with publicly available resources.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
We thus created analogous datasets for English-German and English-Finnish.,4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In the case of German, the embeddings were trained on the 0.9 billion word corpus SdeWaC, which is part of the WaCky collection (Baroni et al., 2009) that was also used for English and Italian.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"Given that Finnish is not included in this collection, we used the 2.8 billion word Common Crawl corpus provided at WMT 20164 instead, which we tokenized using the Stanford Tokenizer (Manning et al., 2014).",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, we created training and test sets for both pairs from their respective Europarl dictionaries from OPUS following the exact same procedure used for English-Italian, and the word embeddings were also trained using the same configuration as Dinu et al. (2015).
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"Given that the main focus of our work is on small seed dictionaries, we created random subsets of 2,500, 1,000, 500, 250, 100, 75, 50 and 25 entries from the original training dictionaries of 5,000 entries.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"This was done by shuffling once the training dictionaries and taking their first k entries, so it is guaranteed that each dictionary is a strict subset of the bigger dictionaries.
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, we explored using automatically generated dictionaries as a shortcut to practical unsupervised learning.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]

"The resulting dictionary had 2772 entries for English-Italian, 2148 for English-German, and 2345 for English-Finnish.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"While more sophisticated approaches are possible (e.g. involving the edit distance of all words), we believe that this method is general enough that should work with practically any language pair, as Arabic numerals are often used even in languages with a different writing system (e.g. Chinese and Russian).
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"While bilingual lexicon induction is a standard evaluation task for seed dictionary based methods like ours, it is unsuitable for bilingual corpus based methods, as statistical word alignment already provides a reliable way to derive dictionaries from bilingual corpora and, in fact, this is how the test dictionary itself is built in our case.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"For that reason, we carried out some experiments in crosslingual word similarity as a way to test our method in a different task and allowing to compare it to systems that use richer bilingual data.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"There are no many crosslingual word similarity datasets, and we used the RG-65 and WordSim353 crosslingual datasets for English-German and the WordSim-353 crosslingual dataset for EnglishItalian as published by Camacho-Collados et al. (2015) 5.

"As for the convergence criterion, we decide to stop training when the improvement on the average dot product for the induced dictionary falls below a given threshold from one iteration to the next.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"After length normalization, the dot product ranges from -1 to 1, so we decide to set this threshold at 1e-6, which we find to be a very conservative value yet enough that training takes a reasonable amount of time.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"The curves in the next section confirm that this was a reasonable choice.

"The method by Zhang et al. (2016) also obtains poor results with small dictionaries, which reinforces our hypothesis in Section 2.2 that their method can only capture coarse-grain bilingual relations for small dictionaries.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, our proposed method obtains very competitive results for all dictionaries, with a difference of only 1-2 points between the full dictionary and both the 25 entry dictionary and the numerals dictionary in all three languages.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows the curve of the English-Italian accuracy for different seed dictionary sizes, confirming this trend.
",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"Finally, it is worth mentioning that, even if all the three language pairs show the same general behavior, there are clear differences in their absolute accuracy numbers, which can be attributed to the linguistic proximity of the languages involved.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In particular, the results for English-Finnish are about 10 points below the rest, which is explained by the fact that Finnish is a non-indoeuropean agglutinative language, making the task considerably more difficult for this language pair.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In this regard, we believe that the good results with small dictionaries are a strong indication of the robustness of our method, showing that it is able to learn good bilingual mappings from very little bilingual ev-
idence even for distant language pairs where the structural similarity of the embedding spaces is presumably weaker.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In addition to the baseline systems in Section 4.2, in the crosslingual similarity experiments we also tested the method by Luong et al. (2015), which is the state-of-the-art for bilingual word embeddings based on parallel corpora (Upadhyay et al., 2016)6.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"As this method is an extension of word2vec, we used the same hyperparameters as for the monolingual embeddings when possible (see Section 4.1), and leave the default ones otherwise.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"We used Europarl as our parallel corpus to train this method as done by the authors, which consists of nearly 2 million parallel sentences.

"As shown in the results in Table 2, our method obtains the best results in all cases, surpassing the rest of the dictionary-based methods by 1-3 points depending on the dataset.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"But, most importantly, it does not suffer from any significant degradation for using smaller dictionaries and, in fact, our method gets better results using the 25 entry dictionary or the numeral list as the only bilingual evidence than any of the baseline systems using much richer resources.
",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"The relatively poor results of Luong et al. (2015) can be attributed to the fact that the dictionary based methods make use of much bigger monolingual corpora, while methods based on parallel corpora are restricted to smaller corpora.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"However, it is not clear how to introduce monolingual corpora on those methods.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]

"In contrast, a good solution would map source language words close to their translation equivalents in the target language space, and they would thus have their corresponding embeddings nearby, making the optimization value large.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"While it is certainly possible to build degenerated solutions that take high optimization values for small subsets of the vocabulary, we think that the structural similarity between independently trained embedding spaces in different languages is strong enough that optimizing this function yields to meaningful bilingual mappings when the size of the vocabulary is much larger than the dimensionality of the embeddings.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
The reasoning for how the self-learning framework is optimizing this objective is as follows.,5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"At the end of each iteration, the dictionary D is updated to assign, for the current mapping W , each source language word to its closest target language word.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"This way, when we update W to maximize the average similarity of these dictionary entries at the beginning of the next iteration, it is guaranteed that the value of the optimization objective will improve (or at least remain the same).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"The reason is that the average similarity between each word and what were previously the closest words will be improved if possible, as this is what the updated W directly optimizes (see Section 3.1).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, it is also possible that, for some source words, some other target words get closer after the update.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"Thanks to this, our self-learning algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum of the above global objective, behaving like an alternating optimization algorithm for it.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"It is interesting to note that the above reasoning is valid no matter what the the initial solution is, and, in fact, the global optimization objective does not depend on the seed dictionary nor any other
bilingual resource.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"For that reason, it should be possible to use a random initialization instead of a small seed dictionary.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"However, we empirically observe that this works poorly in practice, as our algorithm tends to get stuck in poor local optima when the initial solution is not good enough.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"The general behavior of our method is reflected in Figure 3, which shows the learning curve for different seed dictionaries according to both the objective function and the accuracy on bilingual lexicon induction.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"As it can be seen, the objective function is improved from iteration to iteration and converges to a local optimum just as expected.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"At the same time, the learning curves show a strong correlation between the optimization objective and the accuracy, as it can be clearly observed that improving the former leads to an improvement of the latter, confirming our explanations.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"Regarding random initialization, the figure shows that the algorithm gets stuck in a poor local optimum of the objective function, which is the reason of the bad performance (0% accuracy) on bilingual lexicon induction, but the proposed optimization objective itself seems to be adequate.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"Finally, we empirically observe that our algorithm learns similar mappings no matter what the seed dictionary was.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"We first repeated our experiments on English-Italian bilingual lexicon induction for 5 different dictionaries of 25 entries, obtaining an average accuracy of 38.15% and a standard deviation of only 0.75%.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, we observe that the overlap between the predictions made when starting with the full dictionary and the numerals dictionary is 76.00% (60.00% for the 25 entry dictionary).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"At the same time,
37.00% of the test cases are correctly solved by both instances, and it is only 5.07% of the test cases that one of them gets right and the other wrong (34.00% and 8.94% for the 25 entry dictionary).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"This suggests that our algorithm tends to converge to similar solutions even for disjoint seed dictionaries, which is in line with our view that we are implicitly optimizing an objective that is independent from the seed dictionary, yet a seed dictionary is necessary to build a good enough initial solution to avoid getting stuck in poor local optima.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"For that reason, it is likely that better methods to tackle this optimization problem would allow learning bilingual word embeddings without any bilingual evidence at all and, in this regard, we believe that our work opens exciting opportunities for future research.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"So as to better understand the behavior of our system, we performed an error analysis of its output in English-Italian bilingual lexicon induction when starting with the 5,000 entry, the 25 entry and the numeral dictionaries in comparison with the baseline method of Artetxe et al. (2016) with the 5,000 entry dictionary.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"For that purpose, we took 100 random examples from the test set in the [1-5K] frequency bin, another 100 from the [5K20K] frequency bin and 30 from the [100K-200K] frequency bin, and manually analyzed each of the errors made by all the 4 different variants.
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"Our analysis first reveals that, in all the cases, about a third of the translations taken as erroneous according to the gold standard are not so in real-
ity.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
This corresponds to both different morphological variants of the gold standard translations (e.g. dichiarato/dichiarò) and other valid translations that were missing in the gold standard (e.g. climb → salita instead of the gold standard scalato).,6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"This phenomenon is considerably more pronounced in the first frequency bins, which already have a much higher accuracy according to the gold standard.
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"As for the actual errors, we observe that nearly a third of them correspond to named entities for all the different variants.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, the vast majority of the proposed translations in these cases are also named entities (e.g. Ryan→ Jason, John→ Paolo), which are often highly related to the original ones (e.g. Volvo→ BMW, Olympus→ Nikon).",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"While these are clear errors, it is understandable that these methods are unable to discriminate between named entities to this degree based solely on the distributional hypothesis, in particular when it comes to common proper names (e.g. John, Andy), and one could design alternative strategies to address this issue like taking the edit distance as an additional signal.
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"For the remaining errors, all systems tend to propose translations that have some degree of relationship with the correct ones, including nearsynonyms (e.g. guidelines → raccomandazioni), antonyms (e.g. sender→ destinatario) and words in the same semantic field (e.g. nominalism→ intuizionismo / innatismo, which are all philosophical doctrines).",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"However, there are also a few instances where the relationship is weak or unclear (e.g. loch→ giardini, sweep→ serrare).",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"We also observe a few errors that are related to multiwords or collocations (e.g. carrier→ aereo, presumably related to the multiword air carrier / linea aerea), as well as some rare word that is repeated across many translations (Ferruzzi), which could be attributed to the hubness problem (Dinu et al., 2015; Lazaridou et al., 2015).
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"All in all, our error analysis reveals that the baseline method of Artetxe et al. (2016) and the proposed algorithm tend to make the same kind of errors regardless of the seed dictionary used by the latter, which reinforces our interpretation in the previous section regarding an underlying optimization objective that is independent from any training dictionary.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"Moreover, it shows that the quality of the learned mappings is much better than what the raw accuracy numbers might sug-
gest, encouraging the incorporation of these techniques in other applications.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"In this work, we propose a simple self-learning framework to learn bilingual word embedding mappings in combination with any embedding mapping and dictionary induction technique.",7 Conclusions and future work,[0],[0]
"Our experiments on bilingual lexicon induction and crosslingual word similarity show that our method is able to learn high quality bilingual embeddings from as little bilingual evidence as a 25 word dictionary or an automatically generated list of numerals, obtaining results that are competitive with state-of-the-art systems using much richer bilingual resources like larger dictionaries or parallel corpora.",7 Conclusions and future work,[0],[0]
"In spite of its simplicity, a more detailed analysis shows that our method is implicitly optimizing a meaningful objective function that is independent from any bilingual data which, with a better optimization method, might allow to learn bilingual word embeddings in a completely unsupervised manner.

Power-stability and orthogonal decomposition The exponential runtime of our algorithm stems from the fact that the set UN of Newton-stable eigenpairs ofWσ is typically O(2d).,4. Learning in the presence of noise,[0],[0]
"However, in some cases, the set U∗ of d relevant eigenpairs has additional structure so that a smaller candidate set may be computed instead of UN .",4. Learning in the presence of noise,[0],[0]

"For example, the sentence I really love my job.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
I work 40 hours a week to be this poor.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
requires an NLP system to be able to understand that the opinion holder has not expressed a positive sentiment towards her / his job.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the absence of explicit clues in the text, it is difficult for automatic systems to arrive at a correct classification decision, as they often lack external knowledge about various aspects of the text being classified.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Mishra et al. (2016b) and Mishra et al. (2016c) show that NLP systems based on cognitive data (or simply, Cognitive NLP systems) , that leverage eye-movement information obtained from human readers, can tackle the semantic and pragmatic challenges better.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The hypothesis here is that human gaze activities are related to the cognitive processes in the brain that combine the “external knowledge” that the reader possesses with textual clues that she / he perceives.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While incorporating behavioral information obtained from gaze-data in NLP systems is intriguing and quite plausible, especially due to the availability of low cost eye-tracking machinery (Wood and Bulling, 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2013), few methods exist for text classification, and they rely on handcrafted features extracted from gaze data (Mishra et al., 2016b,c).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These systems have limited capabilities due to two reasons: (a) Manually designed gaze based features may not adequately
377
capture all forms of textual subtleties (b) Eyemovement data is not as intuitive to analyze as text which makes the task of designing manual features more difficult.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"So, in this work, instead of handcrafting the gaze based and textual features, we try to learn feature representations from both gaze and textual data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We test our technique on two publicly available datasets enriched with eyemovement information, used for binary classification tasks of sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our experiments show that the automatically extracted features often help to achieve significant classification performance improvement over (a) existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features and (b) CNN based systems that rely on text input alone.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Terminology A fixation is a relatively long stay of gaze on a visual object (such as words in text) where as a sacccade corresponds to quick shifting of gaze between two positions of rest.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Forward and backward saccades are called progressions and regressions respectively.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A scanpath is a line graph that contains fixations as nodes and saccades as edges.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Presence of linguistic subtleties often induces (a) surprisal (Kutas and Hillyard, 1980; Malsburg et al., 2015), due to the underlying disparity /context incongruity",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"or (b) higher cognitive load (Rayner and Duffy, 1986), due to the presence of lexically and syntactically complex structures.",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"While surprisal accounts for irregular saccades (Malsburg et al., 2015), higher cognitive
load results in longer fixation duration (Kliegl et al., 2004).
",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
Mishra et al. (2016b) find that presence of sarcasm in text triggers either irregular saccadic patterns or unusually high duration fixations than non-sarcastic texts (illustrated through example scanpath representations in Figure 1).,2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"For sentiment bearing texts, highly subtle eyemovement patterns are observed for semantically/pragmatically complex negative opinions (expressing irony, sarcasm, thwarted expectations, etc.) than the simple ones (Mishra et al., 2016b).",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
The association between linguistic subtleties and eye-movement patterns could be captured through sophisticated feature engineering that considers both gaze and text inputs.,2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"In our work, CNN takes the onus of feature engineering.",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"CNNs have been quite effective in learning filters for image processing tasks, filters being used to transform the input image into more informative feature space (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"Filters learned at various CNN layers are quite similar to handcrafted filters used for detection of edges, contours, and removal of redundant backgrounds.",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"We believe, a similar technique can also be applied to eye-movement data, where the learned filters will, hopefully, extract informative cognitive features.",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"For instance, for sarcasm, we expect the network to learn filters that detect long distance saccades (refer to Figure 2 for an analogical il-
lustration).",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"With more number of convolution filters of different dimensions, the network may extract multiple features related to different gaze attributes (such as fixations, progressions, regressions and skips) and will be free from any form of human bias that manually extracted features are susceptible to.",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows the CNN architecture with two components for processing and extracting features from text and gaze inputs.,4 Learning Feature Representations: The CNN Architecture,[0],[0]
The components are explained below.,4 Learning Feature Representations: The CNN Architecture,[0],[0]
The text component is quite similar to the one proposed by Kim (2014) for sentence classification.,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
Words (in the form of one-hot representation) in the input text are first replaced by their embeddings of dimension K (ith word in the sentence represented by an embedding vector xi ∈ RK).,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"As per Kim (2014), a multi-channel variant of CNN (referred to as MULTICHANNELTEXT) can be implemented by using two channels of embeddingsone that remains static throughout training (referred to as STATICTEXT), and the other one that gets updated during training (referred to as NONSTATICTEXT).",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"We separately experiment with static, non-static and multi-channel variants.
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"For each possible input channel of the text component, a given text is transformed into a tensor of fixed length N (padded with zero-tensors wherever
necessary to tackle length variations) by concatenating the word embeddings.
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"x1:N = x1 ⊕ x2 ⊕ x3 ⊕ ...⊕ xN (1)
where ⊕ is the concatenation operator.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"To extract local features1, convolution operation is applied.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"Convolution operation involves a filter, W ∈ RHK , which is convolved with a window of H embeddings to produce a local feature for the H words.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"A local feature, ci is generated from a window of embeddings xi:i+H−1 by applying a non linear function (such as a hyperbolic tangent) over the convoluted output.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"Mathematically,
ci = f(W.xi:i+H−1 + b) (2)
where b ∈ R is the bias and f is the non-linear function.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"This operation is applied to each possible window of H words to produce a feature map (c) for the window size H .
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
c =,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"[c1, c2, c3, ..., cN−H+1] (3)
A global feature is then obtained by applying max pooling operation2 (Collobert et al., 2011) over the feature map.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"The idea behind max-pooling is to capture the most important feature - one with the highest value - for each feature map.
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
We have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one filter (red bordered portions in Figure 3 illustrate the case of H = 2).,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
The model uses multiple filters for each filter size to obtain multiple features representing the text.,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"In the MULTICHANNELTEXT variant, for a window of H words, the convolution operation is separately applied on both the embedding channels.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
Local features learned from both the channels are concatenated before applying max-pooling.,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
The gaze component deals with scanpaths of multiple participants annotating the same text.,4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Scanpaths can be pre-processed to extract two sequences3 of gaze data to form separate channels of input: (1) A sequence of normalized4 durations of fixations (in milliseconds) in the order in which
1features specific to a region in case of images or window of words in case of text
2mean pooling does not perform well.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"3like text-input, gaze sequences are padded where necessary 4scaled across participants using min-max normalization to reduce subjectivity
they appear in the scanpath, and (2) A sequence of position of fixations (in terms of word id) in the order in which they appear in the scanpath.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
These channels are related to two fundamental gaze attributes such as fixation and saccade respectively.,4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"With two channels, we thus have three possible configurations of the gaze component such as (i) FIXATION, where the input is normalized fixation duration sequence, (ii) SACCADE, where the input is fixation position sequence, and (iii) MULTICHANNELGAZE, where both the inputs channels are considered.
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"For each possible input channel, the input is in the form of a P × G matrix (with P → number of participants and G → length of the input sequence).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Each element of the matrix gij ∈ R, with i ∈ P and j ∈ G, corresponds to the jth gaze attribute (either fixation duration or word id, depending on the channel) of the input sequence of the ith participant.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Now, unlike the text component, here we apply convolution operation across two dimensions i.e. choosing a two dimensional convolution filter W ∈ RJK (for simplicity, we have kept J = K, thus , making the dimension of W , J2).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"For the dimension size of J2, a local feature cij is computed from the window of gaze elements gij:(i+J−1)(j+J−1) by,
cij = f(W.gij:(i+J−1)(j+J−1) + b) (4)
where b ∈ R is the bias and f is a non-linear func-
tion.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"This operation is applied to each possible window of size J2 to produce a feature map (c),
c =[c11, c12, c13, ..., c1(G−J+1),
c21, c22, c23, ..., c2(G−J+1), ...,
c(P−J+1)1, c(P−J+1)2, ..., c(P−J+1)(G−J+1)]
(5)
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
A global feature is then obtained by applying max pooling operation.,4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Unlike the text component, max-pooling operator is applied to a 2D window of local features size M × N (for simplicity, we set M = N , denoted henceforth as M2).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"For the window of size M2, the pooling operation on c will result in as set of global features ĉJ = max{cij:(i+M−1)(j+M−1)} for each possible",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"i, j.
We have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one filter (of 2D window size J2 and the max-pooling window size of M2).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"In Figure 3, red and blue bordered portions illustrate the cases of J2 =",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"[3, 3] and M2 = [2, 2] respectively.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Like the text component, the gaze component also uses multiple filters for each filter size to obtain multiple features representing the gaze input.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"In the MULTICHANNELGAZE variant, for a 2D window of J2, the convolution operation is separately applied on both fixation duration and saccade channels and local features learned from both the channels are concatenated before maxpooling is applied.
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Once the global features are learned from both the text and gaze components, they are merged
and passed to a fully connected feed forward layer (with number of units set to 150) followed by a SoftMax layer that outputs the the probabilistic distribution over the class labels.
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"The gaze component of our network is not invariant of the order in which the scanpath data is given as input- i.e., the P rows in the P × G can not be shuffled, even if each row is independent from others.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"The only way we can think of for addressing this issue is by applying convolution operations to all P × G matrices formed with all the permutations of P , capturing every possible ordering.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, this makes the training process significantly less scalable, as the number of model parameters to be learned becomes huge.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"As of now, training and testing are carried out by keeping the order of the input constant.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
We now share several details regarding our experiments below.,5 Experiment Setup,[0],[0]
We conduct experiments for two binaryclassification tasks of sentiment and sarcasm using two publicly available datasets enriched with eye-movement information.,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
Dataset 1 has been released by Mishra et al. (2016a).,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
It contains 994 text snippets with 383 positive and 611 negative examples.,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
"Out of the 994 snippets, 350 are sarcastic.",5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
"Dataset 2 has been used by Joshi et al. (2014) and it consists of 843 snippets comprising movie reviews and normalized tweets out of which 443 are positive, and 400 are negative.",5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
Eye-movement data of 7 and 5 readers is available for each snippet for dataset 1 and 2 respectively.,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
"With text component alone we have three variants such as STATICTEXT, NONSTATICTEXT and MULTICHANNELTEXT (refer to Section 4.1).",5.2 CNN Variants,[0],[0]
"Similarly, with gaze component we have variants such as FIXATION, SACCADE and MULTICHANNELGAZE (refer to Section 4.2).",5.2 CNN Variants,[0],[0]
"With both text and gaze components, 9 more variants could thus beexperimented with.",5.2 CNN Variants,[0],[0]
"For text component, we experiment with filter widths (H) of [3, 4].",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"For the gaze component, 2D filters (J2) set to [3× 3], [4× 4] respectively.",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"The
max pooling 2D window, M2, is set to [2× 2].",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"In both gaze and text components, number of filters is set to 150, resulting in 150 feature maps for each window.",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
These model hyper-parameters are fixed by trial and error and are possibly good enough to provide a first level insight into our system.,5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"Tuning of hyper-parameters might help in improving the performance of our framework, which is on our future research agenda.",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"For regularization dropout is employed both on the embedding and the penultimate layers with a constraint on l2-norms of the weight vectors (Hinton et al., 2012).",5.4 Regularization,[0],[0]
"Dropout prevents co-adaptation of hidden units by randomly dropping out - i.e., setting to zero - a proportion p of the hidden units during forward propagation.",5.4 Regularization,[0],[0]
We set p to 0.25.,5.4 Regularization,[0],[0]
"We use ADADELTA optimizer (Zeiler, 2012), with a learning rate of 0.1.",5.5 Training,[0],[0]
The input batch size is set to 32 and number of training iterations (epochs) is set to 200.,5.5 Training,[0],[0]
10% of the training data is used for validation.,5.5 Training,[0],[0]
"Initializing the embedding layer with of pretrained embeddings can be more effective than random initialization (Kim, 2014).",5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, we have used embeddings learned using the movie reviews with one sentence per review dataset (Pang and Lee, 2005).",5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]
"It is worth noting that, for a small dataset like ours, using a small data-set like the one from (Pang and Lee, 2005) helps in reducing the number model parameters resulting in faster learning of embeddings.",5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]
The results are also quite close to the ones obtained using word2vec facilitated by Mikolov et al. (2013).,5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]

"For sarcasm detection, we compare Mishra et al. (2016b)’s sarcasm classifier with ours using dataset 1 (with available gold standard labels for sarcasm).",5.7 Comparison with Existing Work,[0],[0]
We follow the same 10-fold train-test configuration as these existing works for consistency.,5.7 Comparison with Existing Work,[0],[0]
"In this section, we discuss the results for different model variants for sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection tasks.",6 Results,[0],[0]
Table 1 presents results for sentiment analysis task.,6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"For dataset 1, different variants of our CNN architecture outperform the best systems reported by Mishra et al. (2016c), with a maximum F-score improvement of 3.8%.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
This improvement is statistically significant of p < 0.05 as confirmed by McNemar test.,6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we observe an F-score improvement of around 5% for CNNs with both gaze and text components as compared to CNNs with only text components (similar to the system by Kim (2014)), which is also statistically significant (with p < 0.05).
",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"For dataset 2, CNN based approaches do not perform better than manual feature based approaches.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"However, variants with both text and gaze components outperform the ones with only text component (Kim, 2014), with a maximum Fscore improvement of 2.9%.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"We observe that for dataset 2, training accuracy reaches 100 within 25 epochs with validation accuracy stable around 50%, indicating the possibility of overfitting.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
Tuning the regularization parameters specific to dataset 2 may help here.,6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"Even though CNN might
not be proving to be a choice as good as handcrafted features for dataset 2, the bottom line remains that incorporation of gaze data into CNN consistently improves the performance over onlytext-based CNN variants.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"For sarcasm detection, our CNN model variants outperform traditional systems by a maximum margin of 11.27% (Table 2).",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"However, the improvement by adding the gaze component to the CNN network is just 1.34%, which is statistically insignificant over CNN with text component.",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"While inspecting the sarcasm dataset, we observe a clear difference between the vocabulary of sarcasm and non-sarcasm classes in our dataset.",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"This, perhaps, was captured well by the text component, especially the variant with only non-static embeddings.",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"In this section, some important observations from our experiments are discussed.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Embedding dimension has proven to have a deep impact on the performance of neural systems (dos Santos and Gatti, 2014; Collobert et al., 2011).
",7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
We repeated our experiments by varying the embedding dimensions in the range of [50-300]5 and observed that reducing embedding dimension improves the F-scores by a little margin.,7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
Small embedding dimensions are probably reducing the chances of over-fitting when the data size is small.,7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
"We also observe that for different embedding dimensions, performance of CNN with both gaze and text components is consistently better than that with only text component.",7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
"Non-static embedding channel has a major role in tuning embeddings for sentiment analysis by bringing adjectives expressing similar sentiment close to each other (e.g, good and nice), where as static channel seems to prevent over-tuning of embeddings (over-tuning often brings verbs like love closer to the pronoun I in embedding space, purely due to higher co-occurrence of these two words in sarcastic examples).",7.2 Effect of Static / Non-static Text Channels,[0],[0]
"For sentiment detection, saccade channel seems to be handing text having semantic incongruity (due
5a standard range (Liu et al., 2015; Melamud et al., 2016)
to the presence of irony / sarcasm) better.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"Fixation channel does not help much, may be because of higher variance in fixation duration.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"For sarcasm detection, fixation and saccade channels perform with similar accuracy when employed separately.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"Accuracy reduces with gaze multichannel, may be because of higher variation of both fixations and saccades across sarcastic and nonsarcastic classes, as opposed to sentiment classes.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"To examine how good the features learned by the CNN are, we analyzed the features for a few example cases.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
Figure 4 presents some of the example test cases for the task of sarcasm detection.,7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"Example 1 contains sarcasm while examples 2, 3 and 4 are non-sarcastic.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"To see if there is any difference in the automatically learned features between text-only and combined text and gaze variants, we examine the feature vector (of dimension 150) for the examples obtained from different model variants.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
Output of the hidden layer after merge layer is considered as features learned by the network.,7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"We plot the features, in the form of color-bars, following Li et al. (2016) - denser col-
ors representing feature with higher magnitude.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"In Figure 4, we show only two representative model variants viz., MULTICHANNELTEXT and MULTICHANNELTEXT+ MULTICHANNELGAZE.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"As one can see, addition of gaze information helps to generate features with more subtle differences (marked by blue rectangular boxes) for sarcastic and non-sarcastic texts.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"It is also interesting to note that in the marked region, features for the sarcastic texts exhibit more intensity than the nonsarcastic ones - perhaps capturing the notion that sarcasm typically conveys an intensified negative opinion.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"This difference is not clear in feature vectors learned by text-only systems for instances like example 2, which has been incorrectly classified by MULTICHANNELTEXT.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"Example 4 is incorrectly classified by both the systems, perhaps due to lack of context.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"In cases like this, addition of gaze information does not help much in learning more distinctive features, as it becomes difficult for even humans to classify such texts.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]

tion and a corresponding supervised task are approached jointly (LeCun et al., 1998).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As an encoder network for text, CNNs typically convolve a set of filters, of window size n, with an inputsentence embedding matrix obtained via word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) or Glove (Pennington et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Different filter sizes n may be used within the same model, exploiting meaningful semantic features from different n-gram fragments.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The learned weights of CNN filters, in most cases, are assumed to be fixed regardless of the input text.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, the rich contextual information inherent in natural language sequences may not be fully captured.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As demonstrated in Cohen and Singer (1999), the context of a word tends to greatly influence its contribution to the final supervised tasks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This observation is consistent with the following intuition: when reading different types of documents, e.g., academic papers or newspaper articles, people tend to adopt distinct strategies for better and more effective understanding, leveraging the fact that the same words or phrases may have different meaning or imply different things, depending on context.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Several research efforts have sought to incorporate contextual information into CNNs to adaptively extract text representations.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One common strategy is the attention mechanism, which is typically employed on top of a CNN (or Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM)) layer to guide the extraction of semantic features.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the embedding of a single sentence, Lin et al. (2017) proposed a selfattentive model that attends to different parts of a sentence and combines them into multiple vector representations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, their model needs considerably more parameters to achieve performance gains over traditional CNNs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To match sentence pairs, Yin et al. (2016) introduced an attentionbased CNN model, which re-weights the convolution inputs or outputs, to extract interdepen-
dent sentence representations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Wang et al. (2016); Wang and Jiang (2017) explore a compare and aggregate framework to directly capture the wordby-word matching between two paired sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, these approaches suffer from the problem of high matching complexity, since a similarity matrix between pairwise words needs to be computed, and thus it is computationally inefficient or even prohibitive when applied to long sentences (Mou et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose a generic approach to learn context-aware convolutional filters for natural language understanding.",1 Introduction,[0.9569406472879136],"['In this paper, we offer a solution: utilize codeswitched social media to discover correlations across languages.']"
"In contrast to traditional CNNs, the convolution operation in our framework does not have a fixed set of filters, and thus provides the network with stronger modeling flexibility and capacity.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we introduce a meta network to generate a set of contextaware filters, conditioned on specific input sentences; these filters are adaptively applied to either the same (Section 3.2) or different (Section 3.3) text sequences.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this manner, the learned filters vary from sentence to sentence and allow for more fine-grained feature abstraction.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, since the generated filters in our framework can adapt to different conditional information available (labels or paired sentences), they can be naturally generalized to model sentence pairs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this regard, we propose a novel bidirectional filter generation mechanism to allow interactions between sentence pairs while constructing context-aware representations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We investigate the effectiveness of our Adaptive Context-sensitive CNN (ACNN) framework on several text processing tasks: ontology classification, sentiment analysis, answer sentence selection and paraphrase identification.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We show that the proposed methods consistently outperforms the standard CNN and attention-based CNN baselines.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our work provides a new perspective on how to incorporate contextual information into text representations, which can be combined with more sophisticated structures to achieve even better performance in the future.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Learning deep text representations has attracted much attention recently, since they can potentially benefit a wide range of NLP applications (Collobert et al., 2011; Kim, 2014; Wang et al., 2017a; Shen et al., 2018a; Tang and de Sa, 2018; Zhang
et al., 2018).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
CNNs have been extensively investigated as the encoder networks of natural language.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work is in line with previous efforts on improving the adaptivity and flexibility of convolutional neural networks (Jeon and Kim, 2017; De Brabandere et al., 2016).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Jeon and Kim (2017) proposed to enhance the transformation modeling capacity of CNNs by adaptively learning the filter shapes through backpropagation.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"De Brabandere et al. (2016) introduced an architecture to generate the future frames conditioned on given image(s), by adapting the CNN filter weights to the motion within previous video frames.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Although CNNs have been widely adopted in a large number of NLP applications, improving the adaptivity of vanilla CNN modules has been considerably less studied.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, the work reported in this paper is the first attempt to develop more flexible and adjustable CNN architecture for modeling sentences.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our use of a meta network to generate parameters for another network is directly inspired by the recent success of hypernetworks for textgeneration tasks (Ha et al., 2017), and dynamic parameter-prediction for video-frame generation (De Brabandere et al., 2016).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast to these works that focus on generation problems, our model is based on context-aware CNN filters and is aimed at abstracting more informative and predictive sentence features.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Most similar to our work, Liu et al. (2017) designed a meta network to generate compositional functions over tree-structured neural networks for encapsulating sentence features.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, their model is only suitable for encoding individual sentences, while our framework can be readily generalized to capture the interactions between sentence pairs.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, our framework is based on CNN models, which is advantageous due to fewer parameters and highly parallelizable computations relative to sequential-based models.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The CNN architectures in (Kim, 2014; Collobert et al., 2011) are typically utilized for extracting sentence representations, by a composition of a convolutional layer and a max-pooling operation over all resulting feature maps.",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"Let the words of a sentence of length T (padded where necessary) be x1, x2, ... , xT .",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"The sentence can be represented
as a matrix X ∈ Rd×T , where each column represents a d-dimensional embedding of the corresponding word.
",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"In the convolutional layer, a set of filters with weights W ∈ RK×h×d is convolved with every window of h words within the sentence, i.e., {x1:h, x2:h+1, . . .",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
", xT−h+1:T }, where K is the number of output feature maps (and filters).",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"In this manner, feature maps p for these h-gram text fragments are generated as:
pi = f(W × xi:i+h−1 + b) (1)
where i = 1, 2, ..., T − h + 1 and × denotes the convolution operator at the ith shift location.",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"Parameter b ∈ RK is the bias term and f(·) is a non-linear function, implemented as a rectified linear unit (ReLU) in our experiments.",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"The output feature maps of the convolutional layer, i.e., p ∈ RK×(T−h+1) are then passed to the pooling layer, which takes the maximum value in every row of p, forming a K-dimensional vector, z.",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
This operation attempts to keep the most salient feature detected by every filter and discard the information from less fundamental text fragments.,3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"Moreover, the max-over-time nature of the pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) guarantees that the size of the obtained representation is independent of the sentence length.
",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"Note that in basic CNN sentence encoders, filter weights are the same for different inputs, which may be suboptimal for feature extraction (De Brabandere et al., 2016), especially in the case where conditional information is available.",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"The proposed architecture to learn contextsensitive filters is composed of two principal modules: (i) a filter generation module, which produces a set of filters conditioned on the input sentence; and (ii) an adaptive convolution module, which applies the generated filters to an input sentence (this sentence may be either the same as or different from the first input, as discussed further in Section 3.3).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"The two modules are jointly differentiable, and the overall architecture can be trained in an end-to-end manner.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Since the generated filters are sample-specific, our ACNN feature extractor for text tends to have stronger predictive power than a basic CNN encoder.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"The general ACNN framework is shown schematically in Figure 1.
Filter generation module Instead of utilizing fixed filter weightsW for different inputs (as (1)), our model generates a set of filters conditioned on the input sentence X .",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Given an input X , the filter-generation module can be implemented, in principle, as any deep (differentiable) architecture.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"However, in order to handle input sentences of variable length common in natural language, we design a generic filter generation module to produce filters with a predefined size.
",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"First, the input X is encapsulated into a fixedlength vector (code) z with the dimension of l, via a basic CNN model, where one convolutional layer is employed along with the pooling operation (as described in Section 3.1).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"On top of this hidden representation z, a deconvolutional layer, which performs transposed operations of convolutions (Radford et al., 2016), is further applied to produce a unique set of filters forX (as illustrated in Figure 1):
z = CNN(X;θe), (2)
f = DCNN(z;θd) , (3)
where θe and θd are the learned parameters in each layer of the filter-generating module, respectively.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we convolve z with a filter of size (fs, l, kx, ky), where fs is the number of generated filters and the kernel size is (kx, ky).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"The output will be a tensor of shape (fs, kx, ky).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Since the dimension of hidden representation z is independent of input-sentence length, this framework guarantees that the generated filters are of the same shape and size for every sentence.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, the encoding part of filter generation module abstracts the information from sentenceX into z. Based on this representation, the deconvolutional up-sampling layer determines a set of fixedsize, fine-grained filters f for the specific input.
",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
Adaptive convolution module The adaptive convolution module takes as inputs the generated filters f and an input sentence.,3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
This sentence and the input to the filter-generation module may be identical (as in Figure 1) or different (as in Figure 2).,3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"With the sample-specific filters, the input sentence is adaptively encoded, again, via a basic CNN architecture as in Section 3.1, i.e., one convolutional and one pooling layer.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Notably, there are no additional parameters in the adaptive convolution module (no bias term is employed).
",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Our ACNN framework can be seen as a generalization of the basic CNN, which can be represented as an ACNN by setting the outputs of the filter-generation module to a constant, regardless of the contextual information from input sentence(s).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Because of the learning-to-learn (Thrun and Pratt, 2012) nature of the proposed ACNN framework, it tends to have greater representational power than the basic CNN.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Considering the ability of our ACNN framework to generate context-aware filters, it can be naturally generalized to the task of text sequence matching.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"In this section, we will describe the proposed Adaptive Question Answering (AdaQA) model in the context of answer sentence selection task.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Note that the corresponding model can be readily adapted to other sentence matching problems as well (see Section 5.2).
",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Given a factual question q (associated with a list of candidate answers {a1, a2, . . .",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
", am} and their corresponding labels y = {y1, y2, . . .",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
", ym}), the goal of the model is to identify the correct answers from the set of candidates.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"For i = 1, 2, . . .",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
",m, if ai correctly answers q, then yi = 1, and otherwise yi = 0.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the task can be cast as a classification problem where, given an unlabeled question-answer pair (qi, ai), we seek to predict the judgement yi.
",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Conventionally, a question q and an answer a are independently encoded by two basic CNNs to fixed-length vector representations, denoted hq and ha, respectively.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
They are then directly employed to predict the judgement y.,3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"This strategy could be suboptimal, since no communication (information sharing) occurs between the questionanswer pair until the top prediction layer.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, while the model is inferring the representation for a question, if the meaning of the answer is
taken into account, those features that are relevant for final prediction are more likely to be extracted.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"So motivated, we propose an adaptive CNN-based question-answer (AdaQA) model for this problem.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The AdaQA model can be divided into three modules: filter generation, adaptive convolution, and matching modules, as depicted schematically in Figure 2.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Assume there is a question-answer pair to be matched, represented by word-embedding matrices, i.e. Q ∈ RTq×d and A ∈ RTa×d, where d is the embedding dimension and Tq and Ta are respective sentence lengths.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"First, they are passed to two filter-generation modules, to produce two sets of filters that encapsulate features of the corresponding input sentences.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Similar to the setup in Section 3.2, we also employ a two-step process to produce the filters.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"For a question Q, the generating process is:
zq = CNN(Q;θqe), (4) f q = DCNN(zq;θ q d) (5)
where CNN and DCNN denote the basic CNN unit and deconvolution layer, respectively, as discussed in Section 2.1.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
Parameters θqe and θ q d are to be learned.,3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The same process can be utilized to produce encodings za and filters fa for the answer input,A, with parameters θae and θ a d, respectively.
",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The two sets of filter weights are then passed to adaptive convolution modules, along with Q and A, to obtain the extracted question and answer embeddings.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"That is, the question embedding is convolved with the filters produced by the answer and vise versa (ψq and ψa are the bias terms to be learned).",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The key idea is to abstract information from the answer (or question) that is pertinent to the corresponding question (or answer).
",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Compared to a Siamese CNN architecture (Bromley et al., 1994), our model selectively encapsulates the most important features for judgement prediction, removing less vital information.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
We then employ the question and answer representations hq ∈,3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Rnh , ha ∈",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
Rnh as inputs to the matching module (where nh is the dimension of question/answer embeddings).,3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Following Mou et al. (2016), the matching function is defined as:
t =",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"[hq;ha;hq − ha;hq ha] (6) p(y = 1|hq,ha) = MLP(t;η′) (7)
where − and denote an element-wise subtraction and element-wise product, respectively.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
[ha;hb] indicates that ha and hb are stacked as column vectors.,3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The resulting matching vector t ∈ R4nh is then sent through an MLP layer (with sigmoid activation function and parameters η′ to be learned) to model the desired conditional distribution p(yi = 1|hq,ha).
",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Notably, we share the weights of filter generating networks for both the question and answer, so that the model adaptivity for answer selection can be improved without an excessive increase in the number of parameters.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
All three modules in AdaQA model are jointly trained end-to-end.,3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Note that the AdaQA model proposed can be readily adapted to other sentence matching tasks, such as paraphrase identification (see Section 5.2).",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The adaptive context-aware filter generation mechanism proposed here bears close resemblance to attention mechanism (Yin et al., 2016; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2017) widely adopted in the NLP community, in the sense that both methods intend to incorporate rich contextual information into text representations.",3.4 Connections to attention mechanism,[0],[0]
"However, attention is typically operated on top of the hidden units preprocessed by CNN or LSTM layers, and assigns different weights to each unit according to a context vector.",3.4 Connections to attention mechanism,[0],[0]
"By contrast, in our context-aware filter generation mechanism, the contextual information is inherently encoded into the convolutional filters, which directly interact with the input sentence during the convolution encoding operation.",3.4 Connections to attention mechanism,[0],[0]
"Notably, according to our experiments, the proposed filter generation module can be readily combined with (standard) attention mechanisms to further enhance the modeling expressiveness of CNN encoder.",3.4 Connections to attention mechanism,[0],[0]
Datasets We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed ACNN framework on both document classification and text sequence matching tasks.,4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we consider two large-scale document classification datasets: Yelp Reviews Polarity, and DBPedia ontology datasets (Zhang et al., 2015).",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]

"For direct comparison, we employ the same filter shape/size settings as in our basic CNN implementation.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"A one-layer architecture is utilized for both the CNN baseline and the ACNN model, since we did not observe significant

"The minibatch size is set as 128, and a dropout rate of 0.2 is utilized on the embedding layer.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We observed that a larger dropout rate (e.g., 0.5) will hurt performance on document classifications and make training significantly slower.

"To explicitly explore whether our ACNN model can leverage the input-aware filter weights for better sentence representation, we perform a comparison between the basic CNN and ACNN models with only a single filter, which are denoted as SCNN, S-ACNN, respectively (this setting may not yield best overall performance, since only a single filter is used, but it allows us to isolate the impact of adaptivity).",5.1 Document Classification,[0],[0]
"As illustrated in Table 2, SACNN significantly outperforms S-CNN on both datasets, demonstrating the advantage of the filtergeneration module in our ACNN framework.",5.1 Document Classification,[0],[0]
"As a result, with only one convolutional filter and thus very limited modeling capacity, our S-ACNN model tends to be much more expressive than the basic CNN model, due to the flexibility of applying different filters to different sentences.

"Moreover, our method ex-
hibits higher accuracy than n-grams, which is a very strong baseline as shown in (Zhang et al., 2015).",5.1 Document Classification,[0],[0]
We attribute the superior performance of the ACNN framework to its stronger (adaptive) feature-extraction ability.,5.1 Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Moreover, our MACNN also achieves slightly better performance than self-attentive sentence embeddings proposed in Lin et al. (2017), which requires significant more parameters than our method.

"Effect of number of filters To further demonstrate that the performance gains in document categorization experiments originates from the improved adaptivity of our ACNN framework, we implement the basic CNN model with different numbers of filter sizes, ranging from 1 to 1000.",5.1 Document Classification,[0],[0]
"As illustrated in Figure 3(a), when the filter size is larger than 100, the test accuracy of the standard CNN model does not show any noticeable improvement with more filters.",5.1 Document Classification,[0],[0]

"To elucidate the role of different parts (modules) in our AdaQA model, we implement several model variants for comparison: (i) a “vanilla” CNN model that independently encodes two sentence representations for matching; (ii) a self-adaptive ACNN-based model where the question/answer sentence generates adaptive filters only to convolve with the input itself; (iii) a one-way ACNN model where only the answer sentence representation is extracted with adaptive filters, which
are generated conditioned on the question; (iv) a two-way AdaQA model as described in Section 2.4, where both sentences are adaptively encoded, with filters generated conditioned on the other sequence; (v) considering that the proposed filter generation mechanism is complementary to the attention layer typically employed in sequence matching tasks (see Section 3.4), we experiment with another model variant that combines the proposed context-aware filter generation mechanism with the multi-perspective attention layer introduced in (Wang et al., 2017b).

"In this paper, we make a first essential step of addressing the problem of learning continuous semantic representations (SEMVECs) for symbolic expressions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our aim is, given access to a training set of pairs of expressions for which semantic equivalence is known, to assign continuous vectors to symbolic expressions in such a way that semantically equivalent, but syntactically diverse expressions are assigned to identical (or highly similar) continuous vectors.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is an important but hard problem; learning composable SEMVECs of symbolic expressions requires that we learn about the semantics of symbolic elements and operators and how they map to the continuous representation space, thus encapsulating implicit knowledge about symbolic semantics and its recursive abstractive nature.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As we show in our evaluation, relatively simple logical and polynomial expressions present significant challenges and their semantics cannot be sufficiently represented by existing neural network architectures.

Problem Hardness.,2. Model,[0],[0]
Finding the equivalence of arbitrary symbolic expressions is a NP-hard problem or worse.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"For example, if we focus on boolean expressions, reducing an expression to the representation of the false equivalence class amounts to proving its non-satisfiability — an NPcomplete problem.",2. Model,[0],[0]

A network for solving boolean equivalence would require an exponential number of nodes in the size of the expression if P 6= NP .,2. Model,[0],[0]

"The supplementary material shows a sample of such expressions that illustrate the hardness of this problem.
",2. Model,[0],[0]
Notation and Framework.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"To allow our representations to be compositional, we employ the general framework of recursive neural networks (TREENN)",2. Model,[0],[0]
"(Socher et al., 2012; 2013), in our case operating on tree structures of the syntactic parse of a formula.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Given a tree T , TREENNs learn distributed representations for each node in the tree by recursively combining the representations of its subtrees using a neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We denote the children of a node n as ch(n) which is a (possibly empty) ordered tuple of nodes.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"We also use par(n) to refer to the parent node of n. Each node in our tree has a type, e.g. a terminal node could be of type “a” referring to the variable a or of type “and” referring to a node of the logical AND (∧) operation.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We refer to the type of a node n as τn.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"In pseudocode, TREENNs retrieve the representation of a tree T rooted at node ρ, by invoking the function TREENN(ρ) that returns a vector representation rρ ∈ RD, i.e., a SEMVEC.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"The function is defined as TREENN (current node n)
if n is not a leaf then rn ← COMBINE(TREENN(c0), . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", TREENN(ck), τn), where (c0, . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", ck) = ch(n) else rn ← LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn)
return rn The general framework of TREENN allows two points of variation, the implementation of LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING and COMBINE.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) define LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING as a simple lookup operation within a matrix of embeddings and COMBINE as a single-layer neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"As discussed next, these will both prove to be serious limitations in our setting.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"To train these networks to learn SEMVECs, we will use a supervised objective based on a set of known equivalence relations (see Section 2.2).",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Our domain requires that the network learns to abstract away syntax, assigning identical representations to expressions that may be syntactically different but semantically equivalent, and also assigning different representations to expressions that may be syntactically very similar but nonequivalent.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In this work, we find that standard neural architectures do not handle well this challenge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To represent semantics from syntax, we need to learn to recursively
compose and decompose semantic representations and remove syntactic “noise”.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Any syntactic operation may significantly change semantics (e.g. negation, or appending ∧FALSE) while we may reach the same semantic state through many possible operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This necessitates using high-curvature operations over the semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, some operations are semantically reversible and thus we need to learn reversible semantic representations (e.g. ¬¬A and A should have an identical SEMVECs).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Based on these, we define neural equivalence networks (EQNET), which learn to compose representations of equivalence classes into new equivalence classes (Figure 1a).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Our network follows the TREENN architecture, i.e. is implemented using TREENN to model the compositional nature of symbolic expressions but is adapted based on the domain requirements.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The extensions we introduce have two aims: first, to improve the network training; and second, and more interestingly, to encourage the learned representations to abstract away surface level information while retaining semantic content.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
The first extension that we introduce is to the network structure at each layer in the tree.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) use a single-layer neural network at each tree node.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"During our preliminary investigations and in Section 3, we found that single layer networks are not adequately expressive to capture all operations that transform the input SEMVECs to the output SEMVEC and maintain semantic equivalences, requiring high-curvature operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Part of the problem stems from the fact that within the Euclidean space of SEMVECs some operations need to be non-linear.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
For example a simple XOR boolean operator requires high-curvature operations in the continuous semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Instead, we turn to multi-layer neural
networks.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In particular, we define the network as shown in the function COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This uses a twolayer MLP with a residual-like connection to compute the SEMVEC of each parent node in that syntax tree given that of its children.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Each node type τn, e.g., each logical operator, has a different set of weights.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We experimented with deeper networks but this did not yield any improvements.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"However, as TREENNs become deeper, they suffer from optimization issues, such as diminishing and exploding gradients.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"This is essentially because of the highly compositional nature of tree structures, where the same network (i.e. the COMBINE non-linear function) is used recursively, causing it to “echo” its own errors and producing unstable feedback loops.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We observe this problem even with only two-layer MLPs, as the overall network can become quite deep when using two layers for each node in the syntax tree.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We resolve this issue in the training procedure by constraining each SEMVEC to have unit norm.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"That is, we set LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn) = Cτn/ ‖Cτn‖2 , and we normalize the output of the final layer of COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The normalization step of l̄out and Cτn is somewhat similar to weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) and vaguely resembles layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Normalizing the SEMVECs partially resolves issues with diminishing and exploding gradients, and removes a spurious degree of freedom in the semantic representation.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"As simple as this modification may seem, we found it vital for obtaining good performance, and all of our multi-layer TREENNs converged to low-performing settings without it.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although these modifications seem to improve the representation capacity of the network and its ability to be trained, we found that they were not on their own sufficient for good
performance.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In our early experiments, we noticed that the networks were primarily focusing on syntax instead of semantics, i.e., expressions that were nearby in the continuous space were primarily ones that were syntactically similar.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"At the same time, we observed that the networks did not learn to unify representations of the same equivalence class, observing multiple syntactically distinct but semantically equivalent expressions to have distant SEMVECs.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Therefore we modify the training objective in order to encourage the representations to become more abstract, reducing their dependence on surface-level syntactic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We add a regularization term on the SEMVECs that we call a subexpression autoencoder (SUBEXPAE).,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We design this regularization to encourage the SEMVECs to have two properties: abstraction and reversibility.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Because abstraction arguably means removing irrelevant information, a network with a bottleneck layer seems natural, but we want the training objective to encourage the bottleneck to discard syntactic information rather than semantic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To achieve this, we introduce a component that aims to encourage reversibility, which we explain by an example.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Observe that given the semantic representation of any two of the three nodes of a subexpression (by which we mean the parent, left child, right child of an expression tree)",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
it is often possible to completely determine or at least place strong constraints on the semantics of the third.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, consider a boolean formula F (a, b) = F1(a, b) ∨ F2(a, b) where F1 and F2 are arbitrary propositional formulae over the variables a, b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then clearly if we know that F implies that a is true but F1 does not, then F2 must imply that a is true.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More generally, if F belongs to some equivalence class e0 and F1 belongs to a different class e1, we want the continuous representation of F2 to reflect that there are strong constraints on the equivalence class of F2.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Subexpression autoencoding encourages abstraction by employing an autoencoder with a bottleneck, thereby removing irrelevant information from the representations, and encourages reversibility by autoencoding the parent and child representations together, to encourage dependence in the representations of parents and children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More specifically, given any node p in the tree with children c0 . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"ck, we can define a parent-children tuple",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"[rc0 , . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
", rck , rp] containing the (computed) SEMVECs of the children and parent nodes.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
What SUBEXPAE does is to autoencode this representation tuple into a low-dimensional space with a denoising autoencoder.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We then seek to minimize the reconstruction error of the child representations (r̃c0 , . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
", r̃ck ) as well as the reconstructed parent representation r̃p that can be computed from the reconstructed children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More formally, we minimize the return value of SUBEXPAE in Figure 1c where n is a binary noise vector with κ percent of its elements set to zero.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Note that the encoder is specific to the parent node type τp.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although our SUBEXPAE may seem similar to the recursive autoencoders of Socher et al. (2011), it differs
in two major ways.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE autoencodes on the entire parent-children representation tuple, rather than the child representations alone.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, the encoding is not used to compute the parent representation, but only serves as a regularizer.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Subexpression autoencoding has several desirable effects.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, it forces each parent-children tuple to lie in a lowdimensional space, requiring the network to compress information from the individual subexpressions.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, because the denoising autoencoder is reconstructing parent and child representations together, this encourages child representations to be predictable from parents and siblings.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Putting these two together, the goal is that the information discarded by the autoencoder bottleneck will be more syntactic than semantic, assuming that the semantics of child node is more predictable from its parent and sibling than its syntactic realization.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The goal is to nudge the network to learn consistent, reversible semantics.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Additionally, subexpression autoencoding has the potential to gradually unify distant representations that belong to the same equivalence class.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To illustrate this point, imagine two semantically equivalent c′0 and c ′′ 0 child nodes of different expressions that
have distant SEMVECs, i.e. ∥∥rc′0 − rc′′0 ∥∥2 although COMBINE(rc′0 , . . . )",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"≈ COMBINE(rc′′0 , . . . ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In some cases due to the autoencoder noise, the differences between the input tuple x′,x′′ that contain rc′0 and rc′′0 will be non-existent and the decoder will predict a single location r̃c0 (possibly different from rc′0 and rc′′0 ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then, when minimizing the reconstruction error, both rc′0 and rc′′0 will be attracted to r̃c0 and eventually should merge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We train EQNETs from a dataset of expressions whose semantic equivalence is known.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Given a training set T = {T1 . . .,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"TN} of parse trees of expressions, we assume that the training set is partitioned into equivalence classes E = {e1 . . .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
eJ}.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We use a supervised objective similar to classification; the difference between classification and our setting is that whereas standard classification problems consider a fixed set of class labels, in our setting the number of equivalence classes in the training set will vary with N .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Given an expression tree T that belongs to the equivalence class ei ∈ E , we compute the probability
P (ei|T ) =",2.2. Training,[0],[0]

qej,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"+ bj
) (1) where qei are model parameters that we can interpret as representations of each equivalence class that appears in the training class, and bi are scalar bias terms.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Note that in this work, we only use information about the equivalence class of the whole expression T , ignoring available information about subexpressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"This is without loss of generality, because if we do know the equivalence class of a subexpression of T , we can simply add that subexpression to
the training set.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"To train the model, we use a max-margin objective that maximizes classification accuracy, i.e.
LACC(T, ei) = max (
0, arg max ej 6=ei,ej∈E log P (ej |T ) P (ei|T ) +m ) (2)
where m > 0 is a scalar margin.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"And therefore the optimized loss function for a single expression tree T that belongs to equivalence class ei ∈ E is
L(T, ei) = LACC(T, ei) + µ |Q| ∑ n∈Q SUBEXPAE(ch(n), n)
(3)
",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"where Q = {n ∈ T : | ch(n)| > 0}, i.e. contains the nonleaf nodes of T and µ ∈ (0, 1] a scalar weight.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We found that subexpression autoencoding is counterproductive early in training, before the SEMVECs begin to represent aspects of semantics.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"So, for each epoch t, we set µ = 1− 10−νt with ν ≥ 0.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Instead of the supervised objective that we propose, an alternative option for training EQNET would be a Siamese objective (Chopra et al., 2005) that learns about similarities (rather than equivalence) between expressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"In practice, we found the optimization to be very unstable, yielding suboptimal performance.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
We believe that this has to do with the compositional and recursive nature of the task that creates unstable dynamics and the fact that equivalence is a stronger property than similarity.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Datasets.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate datasets of expressions grouped into equivalence classes from two domains.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The datasets from the BOOL domain contain boolean expressions and the POLY datasets contain polynomial expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In both domains, an expression is either a variable, a binary operator that combines two expressions, or a unary operator applied to a single expression.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When defining equivalence, we interpret distinct variables as referring to different entities in the domain, so that, e.g., the polynomials c · (a · a+ b) and f ·(d·d+e) are not equivalent.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For each domain, we generate “simple” datasets which use a smaller set of possible operators and “standard” datasets which use a larger set of more complex operators.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate each dataset by exhaustively generating all parse trees up to a maximum tree size.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
All expressions are symbolically simplified into a canonical from in order to determine their equivalence class and are grouped accordingly.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]

In the supplementary material we present some sample expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For the polynomial domain, we also generated ONEV-POLY datasets, which are polynomials over a single variable, since they are similar to the setting considered by Zaremba et al. (2014) — although ONEV-POLY is still a little more general because it is not restricted to homogeneous polynomials.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Learning SEMVECs for boolean expressions
is already a hard problem; with n boolean variables, there are 22 n
equivalence classes (i.e. one for each possible truth table).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We split the datasets into training, validation and test sets.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We create two test sets, one to measure generalization performance on equivalence classes that were seen in the training data (SEENEQCLASS), and one to measure generalization to unseen equivalence classes (UNSEENEQCLASS).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
It is easiest to describe UNSEENEQCLASS first.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To create the UNSEENEQCLASS, we randomly select 20% of all the equivalence classes, and place all of their expressions in the test set.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We select equivalence classes only if they contain at least two expressions but less than three times the average number of expressions per equivalence class.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We thus avoid selecting very common (and hence trivial to learn) equivalence classes in the testset.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Then, to create SEENEQCLASS, we take the remaining 80% of the equivalence classes, and randomly split the expressions in each class into training, validation, SEENEQCLASS test in the proportions 60%–15%–25%.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]

Metrics.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
To evaluate the quality of the learned representations we count the proportion of k nearest neighbors of each expression (using cosine similarity) that belong to the same equivalence class.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"More formally, given a test query expression q in an equivalence class c we find the k nearest neighbors Nk(q) of q across all expressions, and define the
score as
scorek(q) = |Nk(q) ∩ c| min(k, |c|) .",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]

"However, this may have to do with the small size of the dataset.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The reader may observe that the simple datasets (containing fewer operations and variables) are easier to learn.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Understandably, introducing more variables increases the size of the represented space reducing performance.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The tf-idf method performs better in settings with more variables, because it captures well the variables and operations used.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Similar observations can be made for sequence models.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The one and two layer TREENNs have mixed performance; we believe that this has to do with exploding and diminishing gradients due to the deep and highly compositional nature of TREENNs.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Although Zaremba et al. (2014) consider a different problem to us, they use data similar to the ONEV-POLY datasets with a traditional TREENN architecture.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Our evaluation suggests that EQNETs perform much better within the ONEV-POLY setting.

Evaluation of Compositionality.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We evaluate whether EQNETs successfully learn to compute compositional representations, rather than overfitting to expression trees of
a small size.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To do this we consider a type of transfer setting, in which we train on simpler datasets, but test on more complex ones; for example, training on the training set of BOOL5 but testing on the testset of BOOL8.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
We average over 11 different train-test pairs (full list in supplementary material) and show the results in Figure 3a and Figure 3b.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"These graphs again show that EQNETs are better than any of the other methods, and indeed, performance is only a bit worse than in the non-transfer setting.
",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Impact of EQNET Components EQNETs differ from traditional TREENNs in two major ways, which we analyze here.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE improves performance.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When training the network with and without SUBEXPAE, on average, the area under the curve (AUC) of scorek decreases by 16.8% on the SEENEQCLASS and 19.7% on the UNSEENEQCLASS.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This difference is smaller in the transfer setting, where AUC decreases by 8.8% on average.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, even in this setting we observe that SUBEXPAE helps more in large and diverse datasets.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The second key difference to traditional TREENNs is the output normalization and the residual connections.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Comparing our model to the one-layer and two-layer TREENNs again, we find that output normalization results in important improvements (the two-layer TREENNs have on average 60.9% smaller AUC).",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We note that only the combination of the residual connections and the output normalization improve the performance, whereas when used separately, there are no significant improvements over the two-layer TREENNs.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]

"Our aim is, given access to a training set of pairs of expressions for which semantic equivalence is known, to assign continuous vectors to symbolic expressions in such a way that semantically equivalent, but syntactically diverse expressions are assigned to identical (or highly similar) continuous vectors.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is an important but hard problem; learning composable SEMVECs of symbolic expressions requires that we learn about the semantics of symbolic elements and operators and how they map to the continuous representation space, thus encapsulating implicit knowledge about symbolic semantics and its recursive abstractive nature.",1.

Problem Hardness.,2. Model,[0],[0]
Finding the equivalence of arbitrary symbolic expressions is a NP-hard problem or worse.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"For example, if we focus on boolean expressions, reducing an expression to the representation of the false equivalence class amounts to proving its non-satisfiability — an NPcomplete problem.",2. Model,[0],[0]

vent an NP-complete problem with neural networks.",2. Model,[0],[0]
A network for solving boolean equivalence would require an exponential number of nodes in the size of the expression if P 6= NP .,2. Model,[0],[0]

",2. Model,[0],[0]
Notation and Framework.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"To allow our representations to be compositional, we employ the general framework of recursive neural networks (TREENN)",2. Model,[0],[0]
"(Socher et al., 2012; 2013), in our case operating on tree structures of the syntactic parse of a formula.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Given a tree T , TREENNs learn distributed representations for each node in the tree by recursively combining the representations of its subtrees using a neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We denote the children of a node n as ch(n) which is a (possibly empty) ordered tuple of nodes.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"We also use par(n) to refer to the parent node of n. Each node in our tree has a type, e.g. a terminal node could be of type “a” referring to the variable a or of type “and” referring to a node of the logical AND (∧) operation.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We refer to the type of a node n as τn.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"In pseudocode, TREENNs retrieve the representation of a tree T rooted at node ρ, by invoking the function TREENN(ρ) that returns a vector representation rρ ∈ RD, i.e., a SEMVEC.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"The function is defined as TREENN (current node n)
if n is not a leaf then rn ← COMBINE(TREENN(c0), . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", TREENN(ck), τn), where (c0, . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", ck) = ch(n) else rn ← LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn)
return rn The general framework of TREENN allows two points of variation, the implementation of LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING and COMBINE.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) define LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING as a simple lookup operation within a matrix of embeddings and COMBINE as a single-layer neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"As discussed next, these will both prove to be serious limitations in our setting.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"To train these networks to learn SEMVECs, we will use a supervised objective based on a set of known equivalence relations (see Section 2.2).",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Our domain requires that the network learns to abstract away syntax, assigning identical representations to expressions that may be syntactically different but semantically equivalent, and also assigning different representations to expressions that may be syntactically very similar but nonequivalent.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In this work, we find that standard neural architectures do not handle well this challenge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To represent semantics from syntax, we need to learn to recursively
compose and decompose semantic representations and remove syntactic “noise”.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Any syntactic operation may significantly change semantics (e.g. negation, or appending ∧FALSE) while we may reach the same semantic state through many possible operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This necessitates using high-curvature operations over the semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, some operations are semantically reversible and thus we need to learn reversible semantic representations (e.g. ¬¬A and A should have an identical SEMVECs).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Based on these, we define neural equivalence networks (EQNET), which learn to compose representations of equivalence classes into new equivalence classes (Figure 1a).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Our network follows the TREENN architecture, i.e. is implemented using TREENN to model the compositional nature of symbolic expressions but is adapted based on the domain requirements.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The extensions we introduce have two aims: first, to improve the network training; and second, and more interestingly, to encourage the learned representations to abstract away surface level information while retaining semantic content.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
The first extension that we introduce is to the network structure at each layer in the tree.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) use a single-layer neural network at each tree node.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"During our preliminary investigations and in Section 3, we found that single layer networks are not adequately expressive to capture all operations that transform the input SEMVECs to the output SEMVEC and maintain semantic equivalences, requiring high-curvature operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Part of the problem stems from the fact that within the Euclidean space of SEMVECs some operations need to be non-linear.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
For example a simple XOR boolean operator requires high-curvature operations in the continuous semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Instead, we turn to multi-layer neural
networks.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In particular, we define the network as shown in the function COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This uses a twolayer MLP with a residual-like connection to compute the SEMVEC of each parent node in that syntax tree given that of its children.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Each node type τn, e.g., each logical operator, has a different set of weights.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We experimented with deeper networks but this did not yield any improvements.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"However, as TREENNs become deeper, they suffer from optimization issues, such as diminishing and exploding gradients.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"This is essentially because of the highly compositional nature of tree structures, where the same network (i.e. the COMBINE non-linear function) is used recursively, causing it to “echo” its own errors and producing unstable feedback loops.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We observe this problem even with only two-layer MLPs, as the overall network can become quite deep when using two layers for each node in the syntax tree.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We resolve this issue in the training procedure by constraining each SEMVEC to have unit norm.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"That is, we set LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn) = Cτn/ ‖Cτn‖2 , and we normalize the output of the final layer of COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The normalization step of l̄out and Cτn is somewhat similar to weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) and vaguely resembles layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Normalizing the SEMVECs partially resolves issues with diminishing and exploding gradients, and removes a spurious degree of freedom in the semantic representation.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"As simple as this modification may seem, we found it vital for obtaining good performance, and all of our multi-layer TREENNs converged to low-performing settings without it.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although these modifications seem to improve the representation capacity of the network and its ability to be trained, we found that they were not on their own sufficient for good
performance.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In our early experiments, we noticed that the networks were primarily focusing on syntax instead of semantics, i.e., expressions that were nearby in the continuous space were primarily ones that were syntactically similar.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"At the same time, we observed that the networks did not learn to unify representations of the same equivalence class, observing multiple syntactically distinct but semantically equivalent expressions to have distant SEMVECs.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Therefore we modify the training objective in order to encourage the representations to become more abstract, reducing their dependence on surface-level syntactic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We add a regularization term on the SEMVECs that we call a subexpression autoencoder (SUBEXPAE).,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We design this regularization to encourage the SEMVECs to have two properties: abstraction and reversibility.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Because abstraction arguably means removing irrelevant information, a network with a bottleneck layer seems natural, but we want the training objective to encourage the bottleneck to discard syntactic information rather than semantic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To achieve this, we introduce a component that aims to encourage reversibility, which we explain by an example.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Observe that given the semantic representation of any two of the three nodes of a subexpression (by which we mean the parent, left child, right child of an expression tree)",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
it is often possible to completely determine or at least place strong constraints on the semantics of the third.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, consider a boolean formula F (a, b) = F1(a, b) ∨ F2(a, b) where F1 and F2 are arbitrary propositional formulae over the variables a, b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then clearly if we know that F implies that a is true but F1 does not, then F2 must imply that a is true.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More generally, if F belongs to some equivalence class e0 and F1 belongs to a different class e1, we want the continuous representation of F2 to reflect that there are strong constraints on the equivalence class of F2.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Subexpression autoencoding encourages abstraction by employing an autoencoder with a bottleneck, thereby removing irrelevant information from the representations, and encourages reversibility by autoencoding the parent and child representations together, to encourage dependence in the representations of parents and children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More specifically, given any node p in the tree with children c0 . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"ck, we can define a parent-children tuple",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"[rc0 , . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
", rck , rp] containing the (computed) SEMVECs of the children and parent nodes.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
What SUBEXPAE does is to autoencode this representation tuple into a low-dimensional space with a denoising autoencoder.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We then seek to minimize the reconstruction error of the child representations (r̃c0 , . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
", r̃ck ) as well as the reconstructed parent representation r̃p that can be computed from the reconstructed children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More formally, we minimize the return value of SUBEXPAE in Figure 1c where n is a binary noise vector with κ percent of its elements set to zero.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Note that the encoder is specific to the parent node type τp.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although our SUBEXPAE may seem similar to the recursive autoencoders of Socher et al. (2011), it differs
in two major ways.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE autoencodes on the entire parent-children representation tuple, rather than the child representations alone.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, the encoding is not used to compute the parent representation, but only serves as a regularizer.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Subexpression autoencoding has several desirable effects.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, it forces each parent-children tuple to lie in a lowdimensional space, requiring the network to compress information from the individual subexpressions.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, because the denoising autoencoder is reconstructing parent and child representations together, this encourages child representations to be predictable from parents and siblings.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Putting these two together, the goal is that the information discarded by the autoencoder bottleneck will be more syntactic than semantic, assuming that the semantics of child node is more predictable from its parent and sibling than its syntactic realization.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The goal is to nudge the network to learn consistent, reversible semantics.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Additionally, subexpression autoencoding has the potential to gradually unify distant representations that belong to the same equivalence class.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To illustrate this point, imagine two semantically equivalent c′0 and c ′′ 0 child nodes of different expressions that
have distant SEMVECs, i.e. ∥∥rc′0 − rc′′0 ∥∥2 although COMBINE(rc′0 , . . . )",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"≈ COMBINE(rc′′0 , . . . ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In some cases due to the autoencoder noise, the differences between the input tuple x′,x′′ that contain rc′0 and rc′′0 will be non-existent and the decoder will predict a single location r̃c0 (possibly different from rc′0 and rc′′0 ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then, when minimizing the reconstruction error, both rc′0 and rc′′0 will be attracted to r̃c0 and eventually should merge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We train EQNETs from a dataset of expressions whose semantic equivalence is known.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Given a training set T = {T1 . . .,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"TN} of parse trees of expressions, we assume that the training set is partitioned into equivalence classes E = {e1 . . .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
eJ}.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We use a supervised objective similar to classification; the difference between classification and our setting is that whereas standard classification problems consider a fixed set of class labels, in our setting the number of equivalence classes in the training set will vary with N .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Given an expression tree T that belongs to the equivalence class ei ∈ E , we compute the probability
P (ei|T ) =",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"exp
( TREENN(T )>qei + bi )∑ j exp ( TREENN(T )>",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
qej,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"+ bj
) (1) where qei are model parameters that we can interpret as representations of each equivalence class that appears in the training class, and bi are scalar bias terms.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Note that in this work, we only use information about the equivalence class of the whole expression T , ignoring available information about subexpressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"This is without loss of generality, because if we do know the equivalence class of a subexpression of T , we can simply add that subexpression to
the training set.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"To train the model, we use a max-margin objective that maximizes classification accuracy, i.e.
LACC(T, ei) = max (
0, arg max ej 6=ei,ej∈E log P (ej |T ) P (ei|T ) +m ) (2)
where m > 0 is a scalar margin.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"And therefore the optimized loss function for a single expression tree T that belongs to equivalence class ei ∈ E is
L(T, ei) = LACC(T, ei) + µ |Q| ∑ n∈Q SUBEXPAE(ch(n), n)
(3)
",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"where Q = {n ∈ T : | ch(n)| > 0}, i.e. contains the nonleaf nodes of T and µ ∈ (0, 1] a scalar weight.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We found that subexpression autoencoding is counterproductive early in training, before the SEMVECs begin to represent aspects of semantics.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"So, for each epoch t, we set µ = 1− 10−νt with ν ≥ 0.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Instead of the supervised objective that we propose, an alternative option for training EQNET would be a Siamese objective (Chopra et al., 2005) that learns about similarities (rather than equivalence) between expressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"In practice, we found the optimization to be very unstable, yielding suboptimal performance.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
We believe that this has to do with the compositional and recursive nature of the task that creates unstable dynamics and the fact that equivalence is a stronger property than similarity.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Datasets.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate datasets of expressions grouped into equivalence classes from two domains.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The datasets from the BOOL domain contain boolean expressions and the POLY datasets contain polynomial expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In both domains, an expression is either a variable, a binary operator that combines two expressions, or a unary operator applied to a single expression.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When defining equivalence, we interpret distinct variables as referring to different entities in the domain, so that, e.g., the polynomials c · (a · a+ b) and f ·(d·d+e) are not equivalent.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For each domain, we generate “simple” datasets which use a smaller set of possible operators and “standard” datasets which use a larger set of more complex operators.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate each dataset by exhaustively generating all parse trees up to a maximum tree size.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
All expressions are symbolically simplified into a canonical from in order to determine their equivalence class and are grouped accordingly.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows the datasets we generated.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
In the supplementary material we present some sample expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For the polynomial domain, we also generated ONEV-POLY datasets, which are polynomials over a single variable, since they are similar to the setting considered by Zaremba et al. (2014) — although ONEV-POLY is still a little more general because it is not restricted to homogeneous polynomials.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Learning SEMVECs for boolean expressions
is already a hard problem; with n boolean variables, there are 22 n
equivalence classes (i.e. one for each possible truth table).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We split the datasets into training, validation and test sets.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We create two test sets, one to measure generalization performance on equivalence classes that were seen in the training data (SEENEQCLASS), and one to measure generalization to unseen equivalence classes (UNSEENEQCLASS).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
It is easiest to describe UNSEENEQCLASS first.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To create the UNSEENEQCLASS, we randomly select 20% of all the equivalence classes, and place all of their expressions in the test set.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We select equivalence classes only if they contain at least two expressions but less than three times the average number of expressions per equivalence class.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We thus avoid selecting very common (and hence trivial to learn) equivalence classes in the testset.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Then, to create SEENEQCLASS, we take the remaining 80% of the equivalence classes, and randomly split the expressions in each class into training, validation, SEENEQCLASS test in the proportions 60%–15%–25%.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We provide the datasets online at groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/cup/semvec.
Baselines.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To compare the performance of our model, we train the following baselines.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"TF-IDF: learns a representation given the expression tokens (variables, operators and parentheses).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
This captures topical/declarative knowledge but is unable to capture procedural knowledge.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
GRU refers to the token-level gated recurrent unit encoder of Bahdanau et al. (2015) that encodes the token-sequence of an expression into a distributed representation.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
Stack-augmented RNN refers to the work of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) which was used to learn algorithmic patterns and uses a stack as a memory and operates on the expression tokens.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We also include two recursive neural networks (TREENN).,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The 1- layer TREENN which is the original TREENN also used by Zaremba et al. (2014).,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also include a 2-layer TREENN, where COMBINE is a classic two-layer MLP without residual connections.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This shows the effect of SEMVEC normalization and subexpression autoencoder.
Hyperparameters.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We tune the hyperparameters of all models using Bayesian optimization (Snoek et al., 2012) on a boolean dataset with 5 variables and maximum tree size of 7 (not shown in Table 1) using the average k-NN (k = 1, . . .",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
", 15) statistics (described next).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The selected hyperparameters are detailed in the supplementary material.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
Metrics.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
To evaluate the quality of the learned representations we count the proportion of k nearest neighbors of each expression (using cosine similarity) that belong to the same equivalence class.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"More formally, given a test query expression q in an equivalence class c we find the k nearest neighbors Nk(q) of q across all expressions, and define the
score as
scorek(q) = |Nk(q) ∩ c| min(k, |c|) .",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"(4)
To report results for a given testset, we simply average scorek(q) for all expressions q in the testset.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also report the precision-recall curves for the problem of clustering the SEMVECs into their appropriate equivalence classes.

"EQNET performs better for all datasets, by a large margin.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The only exception is POLY5, where the 2-L TREENN performs better.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, this may have to do with the small size of the dataset.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The reader may observe that the simple datasets (containing fewer operations and variables) are easier to learn.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Understandably, introducing more variables increases the size of the represented space reducing performance.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The tf-idf method performs better in settings with more variables, because it captures well the variables and operations used.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Similar observations can be made for sequence models.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The one and two layer TREENNs have mixed performance; we believe that this has to do with exploding and diminishing gradients due to the deep and highly compositional nature of TREENNs.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Although Zaremba et al. (2014) consider a different problem to us, they use data similar to the ONEV-POLY datasets with a traditional TREENN architecture.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Our evaluation suggests that EQNETs perform much better within the ONEV-POLY setting.
",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Evaluation of Compositionality.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We evaluate whether EQNETs successfully learn to compute compositional representations, rather than overfitting to expression trees of
a small size.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To do this we consider a type of transfer setting, in which we train on simpler datasets, but test on more complex ones; for example, training on the training set of BOOL5 but testing on the testset of BOOL8.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
We average over 11 different train-test pairs (full list in supplementary material) and show the results in Figure 3a and Figure 3b.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"These graphs again show that EQNETs are better than any of the other methods, and indeed, performance is only a bit worse than in the non-transfer setting.
",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Impact of EQNET Components EQNETs differ from traditional TREENNs in two major ways, which we analyze here.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE improves performance.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When training the network with and without SUBEXPAE, on average, the area under the curve (AUC) of scorek decreases by 16.8% on the SEENEQCLASS and 19.7% on the UNSEENEQCLASS.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This difference is smaller in the transfer setting, where AUC decreases by 8.8% on average.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, even in this setting we observe that SUBEXPAE helps more in large and diverse datasets.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The second key difference to traditional TREENNs is the output normalization and the residual connections.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Comparing our model to the one-layer and two-layer TREENNs again, we find that output normalization results in important improvements (the two-layer TREENNs have on average 60.9% smaller AUC).",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We note that only the combination of the residual connections and the output normalization improve the performance, whereas when used separately, there are no significant improvements over the two-layer TREENNs.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows expressions whose SEMVEC nearest neighbor is of an expression of another equivalence class.,3.2. Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Manually inspecting boolean expressions, we find that EQNET confusions happen more when a XOR or implication operator is

"Moreover, many prior work (Chandar A P et al., 2014; Kočiský et al., 2014) used bilingual or comparable corpus which is also expensive for many low-resource languages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Søgaard et al. (2015) impose a less onerous data condition in the form of linked Wikipedia entries across several languages, however this approach tends to underperform other methods.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To capture the monolingual distributional properties of words it is crucial to train on large monolingual corpora (Luong et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, many previous approaches are not capable of scaling up either because of the complicated objective functions or the nature of the algorithm.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Other methods use a dictionary as the bridge between languages (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Xiao and Guo, 2014), however they do not adequately handle translation ambiguity.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model uses a bilingual dictionary from Panlex (Kamholz et al., 2014) as the source of bilingual signal.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Panlex covers more than a thousand languages and therefore our approach applies to many languages, including low-resource languages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our method selects the translation based on the context in an Expectation-Maximization style training algorithm which explicitly handles polysemy through incorporating multiple dictionary translations (word sense and translation are closely linked (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999)).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to the dictionary,
1285
our method only requires monolingual data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our approach is an extension of the continuous bag-ofwords (CBOW) model (Mikolov et al., 2013b) to inject multilingual training signal based on dictionary translations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We experiment with several variations of our model, whereby we predict only the translation or both word and its translation and consider different ways of using the different learned center-word versus context embeddings in application tasks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We also propose a regularisation method to combine the two embedding matrices during training.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Together, these modifications substantially improve the performance across several tasks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on bilingual lexicon induction task, large improvement over word similarity task compared with previous published crosslingual word embeddings, and competitive result on cross-lingual document classification task.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Notably, our embedding combining techniques are general, yielding improvements also for monolingual word embedding.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper makes the following contributions:
• Proposing a new crosslingual training method for learning vector embeddings, based only on monolingual corpora and a bilingual dictionary;
• Evaluating several methods for combining embeddings, which are shown to help in both crosslingual and monolingual evaluations; and
• Achieving consistent results which are competitive in monolingual, bilingual and crosslingual transfer settings.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There is a wealth of prior work on crosslingual word embeddings, which all exploit some kind of bilingual resource.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"This is often in the form of a parallel bilingual text, using word alignments as a bridge between tokens in the source and target languages, such that translations are assigned similar embedding vectors (Luong et al., 2015; Klementiev et al., 2012).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"These approaches are affected by errors from automatic word alignments, motivating other approaches which operate at the sentence level (Chandar A P et al., 2014; Hermann and Blunsom, 2014; Gouws et al., 2015) through learning compositional vector representations of sentences,
in order that sentences and their translations representations closely match.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"The word embeddings learned this way capture translational equivalence, despite not using explicit word alignments.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Nevertheless, these approaches demand large parallel corpora, which are not available for many language pairs.
Vulić and Moens (2015) use bilingual comparable text, sourced from Wikipedia.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Their approach creates a psuedo-document by forming a bag-ofwords from the lemmatized nouns in each comparable document concatenated over both languages.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
These pseudo-documents are then used for learning vector representations using Word2Vec.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Their system, despite its simplicity, performed surprisingly well on a bilingual lexicon induction task (we compare our method with theirs on this task.)",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Their approach is compelling due to its lesser resource requirements, although comparable bilingual data is scarce for many languages.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Related, Søgaard et al. (2015) exploit the comparable part of Wikipedia.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"They represent word using Wikipedia entries which are shared for many languages.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
A bilingual dictionary is an alternative source of bilingual information.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Gouws and Søgaard (2015) randomly replace the text in a monolingual corpus with a random translation, using this corpus for learning word embeddings.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Their approach doesn’t handle polysemy, as very few of the translations for each word will be valid in context.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
For this reason a high coverage or noisy dictionary with many translations might lead to poor outcomes.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Mikolov et al. (2013a), Xiao and Guo (2014) and Faruqui and Dyer (2014) filter a bilingual dictionary for one-to-one translations, thus side-stepping the problem, however discarding much of the information in the dictionary.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our approach also uses a dictionary, however we use all the translations and explicitly disambiguate translations during training.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Another distinguishing feature on the above-cited research is the method for training embeddings.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
Mikolov et al. (2013a) and Faruqui and Dyer (2014) use a cascade style of training where the word embeddings in both source and target language are trained separately and then combined later using the dictionary.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Most of the other works train multlingual models jointly, which appears to have better performance over cascade training (Gouws et al., 2015).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
For this reason we also use a form of joint training in our work.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our model is an extension of the contextual bag of words (CBOW) model of Mikolov et al. (2013b), a method for learning vector representations of words based on their distributional contexts.",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"Specifically, their model describes the probability of a token wi at position i using logistic regression with a factored parameterisation,
p(wi|wi±k\i) = exp(u>wihi)∑ w∈W exp(u > whi) , (1)
where hi = 12k ∑k
j=−k;j",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
6=0 vwi+j is a vector encoding the context over a window of size k centred around position,3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"i, W is the vocabulary and the parameters V and U ∈ R|W |×d are matrices referred to as the context and word embeddings.",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"The model is trained to maximise the log-pseudo likelihood of a training corpus, however due to the high complexity of computing the denominator of equation (1), Mikolov et al. (2013b) propose negative sampling as an approximation, by instead learning to differentiate data from noise (negative examples).",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"This gives rise to the following optimisation objective
∑
i∈D
( log σ(u>wihi)+",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"p∑
j=1
Ewj∼Pn(w) log σ(−u>wjhi) ) ,
(2) where D is the training data and p is the number of negative examples randomly drawn from a noise distribution Pn(w).",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"Our approach extends CBOW to model bilingual text, using two monolingual corpora and a bilingual dictionary.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
We believe this data condition to be less stringent than requiring parallel or comparable texts as the source of the bilingual signal.,4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"It is common for field linguists to construct a bilingual dictionary when studying a new language, as one of the first steps in the language documentation process.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"Translation dictionaries are a rich information source, capturing much of the lexical ambiguity in a language through translation.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"For example, the word bank in English might mean the river bank
Algorithm 1 EM algorithm for selecting translation during training, where θ = (U,V) are the model parameters and η is the learning rate.
",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"1: randomly initialize V, U 2: for i < Iter do 3: for i ∈ De ∪Df do 4: s← vwi",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]

or financial bank which corresponds to two different translations sponda and banca in Italian.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"If we are able to learn to select good translations, then this implicitly resolves much of the semantic ambiguity in the language, and accordingly we seek to use this idea to learn better semantic vector representations of words.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"To learn bilingual relations, we use the context in one language to predict the translation of the centre word in another language.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
This is motivated by the fact that the context is an excellent means of disambiguating the translation for a word.,4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"Our method is closely related to Gouws and Søgaard (2015), however we only replace the middle word wi with a translation w̄i while keeping the context fixed.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"We replace each centre word with a translation on the fly during training, predicting instead p(w̄i|wi±k\i) but using the same formulation as equation (1) albeit with an augmented U matrix to cover word types in both languages.
",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
The translation w̄i is selected from the possible translations of wi listed in the dictionary.,4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"The problem of selecting the correct translation from the many options is reminiscent of the problem faced in expectation maximisation (EM), in that crosslingual word embeddings will allow for accurate translation, however to learn these embeddings we need to know the translations.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"We propose an EMinspired algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 1, which operates over both monolingual corpora, De and Df .",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"The vector s is the semantic representation combining both the centre word, wi, and the con-
text,1 which is used to choose the best translation into the other language from the bilingual dictionary dict(wi).2 After selecting the translation, we use w̄i together with the context vector h to make a stochastic gradient update of the CBOW log-likelihood.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
Words and their translations should appear in very similar contexts.,4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
One way to enforce this is to jointly learn to predict both the word and its translation from its monolingual context.,4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
"This gives rise to the following joint objective function,
O = ∑
i∈De∪Df
( α log σ(u>wihi)+(1−α) log σ(u>w̄ihi)
+
p∑
j=1
Ewj∼Pn(w) log σ(−u>wjhi) ) , (3)
where α controls the contribution of the two terms.",4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
"For our experiments, we set α = 0.5.",4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
The negative examples are drawn from combined vocabulary unigram distribution calculated from combined data De ∪Df .,4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
Many vector learning methods learn two embedding spaces V and U. Usually only V is used in application.,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"The use of U, on the other hand, is understudied (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) with the exception of Pennington et al. (2014) who use a linear combination U + V, with minor improvement over V alone.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"We argue that with our model, V is better at capturing the monolingual regularities and U is better at capturing bilingual signal.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
The intuition for this is as follows.,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Assuming that we are predicting the word finance and its Italian translation finanze from the context (money, loan, bank, debt, credit) as shown in figure 1.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"In V only the context word representations are updated and in U only the representations of finance, finanze and negative samples such as tree and dog are updated.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"CBOW learns good embeddings because each time it updates the parameters, the words in the contexts are pushed closer to each
1Using both embeddings gives a small improvement compared to just using context vector h alone.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"2We also experimented with using expectations over translations, as per standard EM, with slight degredation in results.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
other in the V space.,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Similarly, the target word wi and the translation w̄i are also pushed closer in the U space.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
This is directly related to poitwise mutual information values of each pair of word and context explained in Levy and Goldberg (2014).,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Thus, U is bound to better at bilingual lexicon induction task and V is better at monolingual word similarity task.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"The simple question is, how to combine both V and U to produce a better representation.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"We experiment with several ways to combine V and U. First, we can follow Pennington et al. (2014) to interpolate V and U in the post-processing step.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"i.e.
γV +",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"(1− γ)U (4)
where γ controls the contribution of each embedding space.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Second, we can also concatenate V and U instead of interpolation such that C =",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"[V : U] where C ∈ R|W |×2d and W is the combined vocabulary from De ∪Df .
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we can also fuse V and U during training.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"For each word in the combined dictionary Ve ∪ Vf , we encourage the model to learn similar representation in both V and U by adding a regularization term to the objective function in equation (3) during training.

"O + δ ∑

where δ controls to what degree we should bind two spaces together.3",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Our experimental evaluation seeks to determine how well lexical distances in the learned embedding

",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
spaces match with known lexical similarity judgements from bilingual and monolingual lexical resources.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"To this end, in §6 we test crosslingual distances using a bilingual lexicon induction task in which we evaluate the embeddings in terms of how well nearby pairs of words from two languages in the embedding space match with human judgements.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Next, to evaluate the monolingual embeddings we evaluate word similarities in a single language against standard similarity datasets (§7).",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Lastly, to demonstrate the usefulness of our embeddings in a task-based setting, we evaluate on crosslingual document classification (§9).
",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Monolingual Data,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The monolingual data is taken from the pre-processed Wikipedia dump from AlRfou et al. (2013).,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The data is already cleaned and tokenized.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We additionally lower-case all words.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Normally monolingual word embeddings are trained on billions of words.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"However, obtaining that much monolingual data for a low-resource language is infeasible.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we only select the first 5 million sentences (around 100 million words) for each language.
",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Dictionary A bilingual dictionary is the only source of bilingual correspondence in our technique.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We prefer a dictionary that covers many languages, such that our approach can be applied widely to many low-resource languages.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We use Panlex, a dictionary which currently covers around 1300 language varieties with about 12 million expressions.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The translations in PanLex come from various sources such as glossaries, dictionaries, automatic inference from other languages, etc.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Accordingly, Panlex has high language coverage but often noisy translations.4 Table 1 summarizes the sizes of monolingual corpora and dictionaries for each pair of language in our experiments.
",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
4We also experimented with a crowd-sourced dictionary from Wiktionary.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Our initial observation was that the translation quality was better but with a lower-coverage.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"For example, for en-it dictionary, Panlex and Wiktionary have a coverage of 42.1% and 16.8% respectively for the top 100k most frequent English words from Wikipedia.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The average number of translations are 5.2 and 1.9 respectively.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We observed similar trend using Panlex and Wiktionary dictionary in our model.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"However, using Panlex results in much better performance.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We can run the model on the combined dictionary from both Panlex and Wiktionary but we leave it for future work.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Given a word in a source language, the bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) task is to predict its translation in the target language.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Vulić and Moens (2015) proposed this task to test crosslingual word embeddings.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
The difficulty of this is that it is evaluated using the recall of the top ranked word.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"The model must be very discriminative in order to score well.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"We build the CLWE for 3 language pairs: it-en, es-en and nl-en, using similar parameters setting with Vulić and Moens (2015).5 The remaining tunable parameters in our system are δ from Equation (5), and the choice of algorithm for combining embeddings.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"We use the regularization technique from §4.3 for combining context and word embeddings with δ = 0.01, and word embeddings U are used as the output for all experiments (but see comparative experiments in §8.)
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Qualitative evaluation We jointly train the model to predict both wi and the translation w̄i, combine V and U during training for each language pair.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows the top 10 closest words in both source and target languages according to cosine similarity.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Note that the model correctly identifies the translation in en as the top candidate, and the top 10 words in both source and target languages are highly related.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"This qualitative evaluation initially demonstrates the ability of our CLWE to capture both the bilingual and monolingual relationship.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Quantitative evaluation Table 3 shows our results compared with prior work.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"We reimple-

",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
ment Gouws and Søgaard (2015) using Panlex and Wiktionary dictionaries.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
The result with Panlex is substantially worse than with Wiktionary.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
This confirms our hypothesis in §2.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"That is the context might be corrupted if we just randomly replace the training data with the translation from noisy dictionary such as Panlex.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Our model when randomly picking the translation is similar to Gouws and Søgaard (2015), using the Panlex dictionary.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
The biggest difference is that they replace the training data (both context and middle word) while we fix the context and only replace the middle word.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"For a high coverage yet noisy dictionary such as Panlex, our approach gives better average score.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Comparing our two most basic models (EM selection and random selection), it is clear that the model using EM to select the translation outperforms random selection by a significant margin.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Our joint model, as described in equation (3) which predicts both target word and the translation, further improves the performance, especially for nl-en.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
We use equation (5) to combine both context embeddings V and word embeddings U for all three language pairs.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
This modification during training substantially improves the performance.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"More importantly, all our improvements are consistent for all three language pairs and both evaluation metrics, showing the robustness of our models.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Our combined model out-performed previous approaches by a large margin.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Vulić and Moens (2015)
used bilingual comparable data, but this might be hard to obtain for some language pairs.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Their performance on nl-en is poor because their comparable data between en and nl is small.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Besides, they also use POS tagger and lemmatizer to filter only Noun and reduce the morphology complexity during training.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
These tools might not be available for many languages.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"For a fairer comparison to their work, we also use the same Treetagger (Schmid, 1995) to lemmatize the output of our combined model before evaluation.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Table 3 (+lemmatization) shows some improvements but minor.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
It demonstrates that our model is already good at disambiguating morphology.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"For example, the top 2 translations for es word lenguas in en are languages and language which correctly prefer the plural translation.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Now we consider the efficacy of our CLWE on monolingual word similarity.,7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"We evaluate on English monolingual similarity on WordSim353 (WSen), RareWord (RW-en) and German version of WordSim353 (WS-de) (Finkelstein et al., 2001; Luong et al., 2013; Luong et al., 2015).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Each of those datasets contain many tuples (w1, w2,s) where s is a scalar denoting the semantic similarity between w1 and w2 given by human annotators.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Good system should produce the score correlated with human judgement.
",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"We train the model as described in §4, which is the combine embeddings setting from Table 3.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Since the evaluation involves de and en word similarity, we train the CLWE for en-de pair.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
Table 4 shows the performance of our combined model compared with several baselines.,7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Our combined model out-performed both Luong et al. (2015) and Gouws and Søgaard (2015)6 which represent the best published crosslingual embeddings trained on bitext and monolingual data respectively.
",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"We also compare our system with the monolingual CBOW model trained on the monolingual data for each language, using the same parameter settings from earlier (§6).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Surprisingly, our combined model performs better than the monolingual CBOW baseline which makes our result close to the monolingual state-of-the-art on each different dataset.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"However, the best monolingual methods use much larger

monolingual corpora (Shazeer et al., 2016), WordNet or the output of commercial search engines (Yih and Qazvinian, 2012).
",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
Next we explain the gain of our combined model compared with the monolingual CBOW model.,7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"First, we compare the combined model with the joint-model with respect to monolingual CBOW model (Table 4).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"It shows that the improvement seems mostly come from combining V and U. If we apply the combining algorithm to the monolingual CBOW model (CBOW + combine), we also ob-
serve an improvement.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Clearly most of the improvement is from combining V and U, however our V and U are more complementary as the gain is more marked.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Other improvements can be explained by the observation that a dictionary can improve monolingual accuracy through linking synonyms (Faruqui and Dyer, 2014).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"For example, since plane, airplane and aircraft have the same Italian translation aereo, the model will encourage those words to be closer in the embedding space.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
Combining context embeddings and word embeddings results in an improvement in both monolingual similarity and bilingual lexicon induction.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"In §4.3, we introduce several combination methods including post-processing (interpolation and concatenation) and during training (regularization).",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"In this section, we justify our parameter and model choices.
",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"We use en-it pair for tuning purposes, considering the value of γ in equation 4.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
Figure 2 shows the performances using different values of γ.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
The two extremes where γ = 0 and γ = 1 corresponds to no interpolation where we just use U or V respectively.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"As γ increases, the performance on WSen increases yet BLI decreases.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
These results confirm our hypothesis in §4.3 that U is better at capturing bilingual relations and V is better at capturing monolingual relations.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"As a compromise, we choose γ = 0.5 in our experiments.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"Similarly, we tune the regularization sensitivity δ in equation (5) which combines embeddings space during training.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"We test δ = 10−n with n = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and us-
ing V, U or the interpolation of both V+U2 as the learned embeddings, evaluated on the same BLI and WS-en.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"We select δ = 0.01.
",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
Table 5 shows the performance with and without using combining algorithms mentioned in §4.3.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"As the compromise between both monolingual and crosslingual tasks, we choose regularization + U as the combination algorithm.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"All in all, we apply the regularization algorithm for combining V and U with δ = 0.01 and U as the output for all language pairs without further tuning.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"In this section, we evaluate our CLWE on a downstream crosslingual document classification (CLDC)
task.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"In this task, the document classifier is trained on a source language and then applied directly to classify a document in the target language.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
This is convenient for a target low-resource language where we do not have document annotations.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"The experimental setup is the same as Klementiev et al. (2012)7 with the training and testing data sourced from Reuter RCV1/RCV2 corpus (Lewis et al., 2004).
",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
The documents are represented as the bag of word embeddings weighted by tf.idf.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
A multi-class classifier is trained using the average perceptron algorithm on 1000 documents in the source language and tested on 5000 documents in the target language.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"We use the CLWE, such that the document representation in the target language embeddings is in the same space with the source language.
",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
We build the en-de CLWE using combined models as described in section §4.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Following prior work, we also use monolingual data8 from the RCV1/RCV2 corpus (Klementiev et al., 2012; Gouws et al., 2015; Chandar A P et al., 2014).

Table 6 shows the CLDC results for various CLWE.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Despite its simplicity, our model achieves competitive performance.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Note that aside from our model, all other models in Table 6 use a large bitext (Europarl) which may not exist for many lowresource languages, limiting their applicability.
7The data split and code are kindly provided by the authors.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
8We randomly sample documents in RCV1 and RCV2 corpora and selected around 85k documents to form 400k monolingual sentences for both en and de.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"For each document, we perform basic pre-processing including: lower-casing, remove html tags and tokenization.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
These monolingual data are then concatenated with the monolingual data from Wikipedia to form the final training data.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Our model exploits dictionaries, which are more widely available than parallel corpora.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"However the question remains as to how well this performs of a real low-resource language, rather than a simulated condition like above, whereupon the quality of the dictionary is likely to be worse.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"To test this, we evaluation on Serbian, a language with few annotated language resources.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]

"Although WNN is able to reduce the number of training iterations and improve generalization, it comes with a price of increasing training time, because eigen-decomposition occupies large computations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The runtime scales up when the number of hidden layers that require whitening transformation increases.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We revisit WNN by breaking down its performance and show that its main runtime comes from two aspects, 1) computing full covariance matrix for whitening and 2) solving singular value decomposition (SVD).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Previous work (Desjardins et al., 2015) suggests to overcome these problems by a) using a subset of training data to estimate the full covariance matrix and b) solving the SVD every hundreds or thousands of training iterations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Both of them rely on the assumption that the SVD holds in this period, but it is generally not true.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"When this period becomes large, WNN degenerates to canonical SGD due to ill conditioning of FIM.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We propose generalized WNN (GWNN), which possesses the beneficial properties of WNN, but significantly reduces its runtime and improves its generalization.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We introduce two variants of GWNN, including pre-whitening and postwhitening GWNNs.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The former one whitens a hidden layer’s input values, whilst the latter one whitens the preactivation values (hidden features).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
GWNN has three appealing characteristics.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, compared to WNN, GWNN is capable of learning more compact hidden representation, such that the SVD can be approximated by a few top eigenvectors to reduce computation.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This compact representation also improves generalization.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, it enables the whitening transformation to be performed in a short period, maintaining conditioning of FIM.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third, by exploiting knowledge of the distribution of the hidden features, we calculate the covariance matrix in an analytical form to further improve computational efficiency.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We begin by defining the basic notation for feed-forward neural network.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
A neural network transforms an input vector o0 to an output vector o` through a series of ` hidden layers {oi}`i=1.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
We assume each layer has identical dimension for the simplicity of notation i.e. ∀oi ∈ Rd×1.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"In this case, all vectors and matrixes in the following should have d rows unless otherwise stated.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"As shown in Fig.1 (a), each fully-connected (fc) layer consists of a weight matrix, W i, and a set of hidden neurons, hi, each of which receives as input a weighted sum of outputs from the previous layer.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
We have hi = W ioi−1.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"In this work, we take fully-connected network as an example.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"Note that the above computation can be also applied to a convolutional network, where an image patch is vectorized as a column vector and represented by oi−1 and each row of W i represents a filter.
",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"As the recent deep architectures typically stack a batch normalization (BN) layer before the pre-activation values, we do not explicitly include a bias term when computing hi, because it is normalized in BN, such that φi = hi−E[hi]√
Var[hi] , where the expectation and variance are computed over a minibatch of samples.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
LeCun et al. (2002) showed that such normalization speeds up convergence even when the hidden features are not decorrelated.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, output of each layer is calculated by a nonlinear activation function.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"A popular choice is the rectified linear unit, relu(x) = max(0, x).",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"The precise computation for an output is oi = max(0,diag(αi)φi + βi), where diag(x) represents a matrix whose diagonal entries are x. αi and βi are two vectors that scale and shift the normalized features, in order to maintain the network’s representation capacity.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
This section revisits whitened neural networks (WNN).,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
Any neural architecture can be adapted to a WNN by stacking a whitening transformation layer after the layer’s input.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, Fig.1 (b) adapts a fc layer as shown in
(a) into a whitened fc layer.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Its information flow becomes

where µi−1 represents a centering variable, µi−1 = E[oi−1].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"P i−1 is a whitening matrix whose rows are obtained from eigen-decomposition of Σi−1, which is the covariance matrix of the input, Σi−1 = E[(oi−1 − µi−1)(oi−1 − µi−1)T].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The input is decorrelated by P i−1 in the sense that its covariance matrix becomes an identity matrix, i.e. E[õi−1õi−1T ] = I .",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"To avoid ambiguity, we use ‘ˆ’ to distinguish the variables in WNN and the canonical fc layer whenever necessary.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For instance, Ŵ i represents a whitened weight matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In Eqn.(1), computation of the BN layer has been simplified because we have E[ĥi] = Ŵ iP i−1(E[oi−1]− µi−1) = 0.
",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We define θ to be a vector consisting of all the whitened weight matrixes concatenated together, θ = {vec(Ŵ 1)T, vec(Ŵ 2)T, ..., vec(Ŵ `)T}, where vec(·) is an operator that vectorizes a matrix by stacking its columns.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]

Conditioning of the FIM.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Here we show that WNN improves training efficiency by conditioning the Fisher information matrix (FIM) (Amari & Nagaoka, 2000).",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"A FIM, denoted as F , consists of `× ` blocks.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Each block is indexed by Fij , representing the covariance (co-adaptation) between the whitened weight matrixes of the i-th and j-th layers.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We have Fij = E[vec(δŴ i)vec(δŴ j)T], where δŴ i indicates the gradient of the i-th whitened weight matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, the gradient of Ŵ i is achieved by õi−1(δĥi)T, as illustrated in Eqn.(1).",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We have vec(δŴ i) = vec(õi−1(δĥi)T) = δĥi ⊗ õi−1, where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In this case, Fij can be rewritten as E[(δĥi ⊗ õi−1)(δĥj ⊗ õj−1)T] = E[δĥi(δĥj)T ⊗ õi−1(õj−1)T].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"By assuming δĥ and õ are independent as demonstrated in (Raiko et al., 2012), Fij can be approximated by E[δĥi(δĥj)T] ⊗ E[õi−1(õj−1)T].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"As a result, when i = j, each diagonal block of F , Fii, has a block diagonal structure because we have E[õi−1(õi−1)T] = I as shown in Eqn.(2), which improves conditioning of FIM and thus speeds up training.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In general, WNN regularizes the diagonal blocks of FIM and achieves stronger conditioning than those methods (LeCun et al., 2002; Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) that regularized the diagonal entries.

Training WNN.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
Alg.1 summarizes training of WNN.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"At the 1st line, the whitened weight matrix Ŵ i0 is initialized by W i of the ordinary fc layer, which can be pretrained or sampled from a Gaussian distribution.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
The 4th line shows that Ŵ it is updated in each iteration t using SGD.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
The first and second constraints are achieved in the 7th and 8th lines respectively.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, the 8th line ensures that the hidden features are the same before and after updating the whitening matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"As the distribution of the hidden representation changes after every update of the whitened weight matrix, to maintain good conditioning of FIM, the whitening matrix, P i−1, needs to be reconstructed frequently by performing eigen-decomposition on Σi−1, which is estimated using N samples.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
N is typically 104 in experiments.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]

"We measure the similarity of the covariance matrix, E[õi−1(õi−1)T], with the identity matrix I .",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
This is called the orthogonality.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
We employ Pearson’s correlation1 as the similarity between two matrixes.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, this measure has a value between −1 and +1, representing negative and positive correlations.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
Larger values indicate higher orthogonality.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Fig.2 visualizes four randomly generated covariance matrixes, where (a,b) are sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Fig.2 (c,d) are generated by truncating different numbers of columns of a randomly generated orthogonal matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For instance, (a,b) have small similarity with respect to the identity matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In contrast, when the correlation equals 0.65 as shown in (c), all entries in the diagonal are larger than 0.9 and more than 80% off-diagonal entries have values smaller than 0.1.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation is insensitive to the size of matrix, such that orthogonality of different layers can be compared together.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, although matrixes in
1Given an identity matrix, I , and a covariance matrix, Σ, the Pearson’s correlation between them is defined as corr(Σ, I) = vec(Σ)Tvec(I)√ vec(Σ)Tvec(Σ)·vec(I)Tvec(I) , where vec(Σ) is a normalized vector by subtracting mean of all entries.
",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"(a) and (b) have different sizes, they have similar value of orthogonality when they are sampled from the same distribution.
",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"As shown in Fig.3 (a), we adopt network-in-network (NIN) (Lin et al., 2014) that is trained on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009), and plot the orthogonalities of three different convolutional layers, which are whitened every τ",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
= 103 iterations by using Alg.1.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We see that orthogonality values during training have large fluctuations except those of the first convolutional layer, abbreviated as ‘conv1’.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"This is because the distributions of deeper layers’ inputs change after the whitened weight matrixes have been updated, leading to ill-conditions of the whitening matrixes, which are estimated in a large interval.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In fact, large τ will degenerate WNN to canonical SGD.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"However, ‘conv1’ uses image data as inputs, whose distribution is typically stable during training.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Its whitening matrix can be estimated once at the beginning and fixed in the entire training stage.

the entire training stage.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
"In contrast, pre-GWNN performs the popular online estimation for the top d′ eigenvectors in P i−1d′ such as online SVD (Shamir, 2015; Povey et al., 2015), instead of using full SVD as WNN did.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]

represents the whitening interval in GWNN and M is the number of samples used to estimate the top eigenvectors.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]

ing theory for the ResNet architectures which simultaneously creates a new technique for boosting over features (in contrast to labels) and provides a new algorithm for ResNet-style architectures. Our proposed training algorithm, BoostResNet, is particularly suitable in nondifferentiable architectures. Our method only requires the relatively inexpensive sequential training of T “shallow ResNets”. We prove that the training error decays exponentially with the depth T if the weak module classifiers that we train perform slightly better than some weak baseline. In other words, we propose a weak learning condition and prove a boosting theory for ResNet under the weak learning condition. A generalization error bound based on margin theory is proved and suggests that ResNet could be resistant to overfitting using a network with l1 norm bounded weights.",text,[0],[0]

"In this data set, more than 90% of the edges do not have enough observations to learn the respective diffusion probabilities accurately, even over a period of two months.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, in a single week (the timeframe in which inference about an event is often most relevant), none of the edges in the data set have sufficiently many observations.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given that even with the data available on Facebook there are not enough observations to learn the model, one needs to impose additional assumptions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A natural approach is to assume that the diffusion probabilities are a function of network and individuals’ characteristics and some underlying
global hyperparameter θ.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the case of events for example, it seems reasonable that influence could be estimated as a function of some global unknown multidimensional parameter θ and individuals’ characteristics such as location, gender, and age, and topological features like the ratio between the intersection and the union of the individuals’ neighborhoods.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Using xu,v to denote the characteristics of u and v, the hyperparametric approach assumes that the probability of u to influence v denoted pu,v is not arbitrary and can be faithfully estimated via some function p that maps θ and xu,v to [0, 1], i.e. pu,v = p(θ,xu,v).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given a set of characteristics, learning the IC model then reduces to recovering the underlying hyperparameter θ.
Intuitively, learning a hyperparametric model necessitates far fewer samples than a general diffusion model for two main reasons.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, since the diffusion probabilities are correlated, each observation provides information about all edges in the network.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, it seems reasonable that the sample complexity of learning the hyperparameter should largely depend on the dimension of the hyperparameter rather than the number of edges the network.

"Beyond potential improvements in sample complexity, a hyperparametric model is convenient due to the structure it imposes.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A recent line of work on influence maximization in bandit models (Wen et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017), assumes that the diffusion probabilities are a linear function of edge features, i.e. pu,v = 〈θ, xu,v〉 and this structure is leveraged in order to develop faster algorithms.",1.

Our goal in this paper is to explore a hyperparametric approach for learning the independent cascade diffusion model.,1.1. A Hyperparametric Approach,[0],[0]
"Doing so requires addressing three open questions:
• Does restriction to a low-dimensional hyperparameter substantially decrease the sample complexity?",1.1. A Hyperparametric Approach,[0],[0]
"As discussed above, the motivation for a hyperparametric approach is that intuitively its sample complexity should depend on the dimension of the hyperparameter rather than the number of edges.",1.1. A Hyperparametric Approach,[0],[0]

"As learning a hyperparametric model requires solving a non-convex optimization problem, it is not clear it can be learned efficiently, in theory or in practice; 1 • Are low-dimensional hyperparametric models predictive?",1.1. A Hyperparametric Approach,[0],[0]

",1.1. A Hyperparametric Approach,[0],[0]
Despite being a non-concave optimization problem we show that the problem has a great deal of structure.,1.1. A Hyperparametric Approach,[0],[0]

Benchmarks.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"We tested the hyperparametric model against the following benchmarks: • Omniscient MLE: The true diffusion probability of an
edge is approximated by p̂e = n+e /ne, where n + e is the number of activations of edge e, while ne is the total number of exposures of e (activation attempts).",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"Here, we assume that for every sample ((X, v), y) we observe the activation or not of all the edges e = (u, v), where u is an active neighbor of v.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"This is a strong benchmark since in practice, we can observe whether v became active but not which node activated it.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"• Non-hyperparametric MLE: We implemented the algorithm of (Narasimhan et al., 2015), that allows one
to learn the diffusion probabilities only by observing whether a node v was influenced by the seed X or not.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"• Hyperparametric MLE, reduced information: We com-
pare ourselves against a hyperparametric model that is unaware of the exact features that are important, and selects only a subset of them.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
Here we select only 5 out of 10 important features of every node.,5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"• Hyperparametric MLE, augmented information: Similarly, we compare ourselves against a hyperparametric model that is unaware of the important features, thus it selects all the available ones (15 features per node).

"We repeat each experiment 10 times, and provide the mean and the standard deviation in Figure 3.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"The y-axis corresponds to 1|E| ∑ e∈E |pe − p̂e|, the average absolute error between the real probability (known by construction) and the empirical one across the network.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"In all networks, the hyperparametric approach greatly outperforms the nonhyperparametric benchmarks, even assuming omniscience.
",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"Note that in the non-hyperparametric benchmarks, since samples do not carry global information, there exist edges that have no exposures given the samples that we have seen so far.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"In that case, we define p̂e = 0.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"This explains the initial increase in the error in the omniscient MLE since, if pe is small and the first exposure of edge e is an activation, the error on e increases from pe to 1 − pe.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"Once we see enough samples, p̂e converges to pe.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"One can also notice, the effect of omniscience since it leads to faster convergence than actual implementable non-hyperparametric methods.
",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"Regarding the two benchmarks that involve the hyperparametric assumption it is worth noting that reduced information does not allow convergence to 0 error, while augmented
information does (see also Figure 4d for a more detailed investigation).",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"Finally, the initial difference in the errors of different networks is related to how good predictor the initialization of SGD is (i.e. θ = 0), as well as how large the average diffusion probability in the network is.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]
"The learning effect is evident and universal though, since the error converges to 0 independently of the underlying network.",5.1. Learning the Diffusion Probabilities,[0],[0]

Samples vs Concavity.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
In Section 4 we classified the samples into categories based on whether they yield concave log-likelihood or not.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"Recall that if we ignore the obfuscated samples, the optimization problem becomes concave.",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
A natural question is whether sacrificing samples for concavity leads to faster convergence.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"To this end, we generate samples and if a sample is obfuscated, we discard it with probability p ∈ {0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}.",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
The results can be found in Figure 4a.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]

Approximate models.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
Here we investigate how properties of the graph or the model affect the convergence rate.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"• Graph Density: We create an Erdös-Rényi graph with
1000 nodes and varying number of edges, exploring how does graph density affect the convergence of the error.",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"As the density increases, so does the average degree in the network and, as a result, the number of obfuscated samples.",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"Hence, the information obtained becomes “noisier” and convergence is slower.",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
• Noisy model: Until now we assumed that the hyperparametric model is the ground truth.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]

"Features Effect: In many cases we might not know the exact features that support the hyperparametric model.
",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
We explore the effect of this lack of information by including varying number of significant features in our model.,5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"Our results show that in terms of convergence more information does not hurt, despite being more costly computationally.",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"However, if we fail to include all the significant features, we do not converge to 0 error, and the error grows with the removal of features.
",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"The results can be found in Figure 4b-d. In all the cases the way that we enforced the hyperparametric assumption, created the samples and ran SGD is the same as in Section 5.1.",5.2. Convergence Rate Investigation,[0],[0]
"Importantly, we evaluate the validity of the hyperparametric assumption on real cascade data.",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]

"Moreover, when friends join an event a user may be notified in their Facebook feed and join in turn.",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
The cascade in this scenario is an event and an exposure is either a direct invite or a feed notification.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
A user is influenced if she marked herself as “going” to the event.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
This dataset is a random sample of events that happened over a twomonth period in late 2017.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]

Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
The categorical features were binarized in the model.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
An important difference with the experiments of Sections 5.1 and 5.2 is that here we don’t know the true diffusion probability of every edge by construction.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"Instead, we estimate it from samples as p̂e = n+e ne
.",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"In order to estimate p̂e accurately, we need enough samples for edge e. Hence, we restrict our evaluation set (the set of edges where we measure the error) only to edges that have at least 67 interactions, meaning that |pe − p̂e| ≤ 0.15 with probability at least 90%.",5.3.

Results.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
Our first set of experiments is to validate the hyperparametric assumption in real data.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"We observe that using the optimization problem (2), with very few samples, the hyperparametric model achieves significant reduction in average error (up to 60%) over methods that don’t utilize node features.",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"The results, reported in Fig. 5, are consistent with our synthetic experiments, where the hyperparametric assumption holds by construction.",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"Note that the non-hyperparametric methods will eventually converge to zero error as they correspond to the ground truth while the hyperparametric model is only a good approximation of it.
",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
We also included reduced and augmented hyperparametric models for comparison as in the synthetic experiments.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
In the case of the reduced model we used only 20% of the most important features of each edge (measured using Mutual Information).,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"For the augmented version on the other hand, we augment the feature vector of each node with redundant information (increase its dimension by 50% and fill the extra coordinates with random noise) and investigate whether convergence still occurs.",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"As in the experiments of Section 5.1, the reduced model converges to higher average error than the models that use more information, while the augmented model successfully ignores all the redundant features.
",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
We also evaluated the sensitivity of the hyperparametric model when we include all versus few selected features.,5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"The picture that we see matches the synthetic experiments (Figure 4d), i.e. the hyperparametric model is supported on several features and if we fail to include all of them our error won’t converge to 0.",5.3. Are Low-dimensional Models Predictive?,[0],[0]
"However, an important difference with the synthetic experiments is that here not all the features are equally important, hence by applying feature-selection algorithms we can collect a small subset that performs almost as well as using the entire feature vector (see e.g. the difference in the error between 20% and 90% of the features).",5.3.

In this paper we advocate for a hyperparametric approach to learn diffusion in the independent cascade (IC) model.,abstractText,[0],[0]
The sample complexity of this model is a function of the number of edges in the network and consequently learning becomes infeasible when the network is large.,abstractText,[0],[0]
We study a natural restriction of the hypothesis class using additional information available in order to dramatically reduce the sample complexity of the learning process.,abstractText,[0],[0]
In particular we assume that diffusion probabilities can be described as a function of a global hyperparameter and features of the individuals in the network.,abstractText,[0],[0]
One of the main challenges with this approach is that training a model reduces to optimizing a non-convex objective.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"Despite this obstacle, we can shrink the best-known sample complexity bound for learning IC by a factor of |E|/d where |E| is the number of edges in the graph and d is the dimension of the hyperparameter.",abstractText,[0],[0]
We show that under mild assumptions about the distribution generating the samples one can provably train a model with low generalization error.,abstractText,[0],[0]

"The dialog manager is one of the key components of dialog systems, which is responsible for modeling the decision-making process.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, it typically takes a new utterance and the dialog context as input, and generates discourse-level decisions (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2003; Williams and Young, 2007).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Advanced dialog managers usually have a list of potential actions that enable them to have diverse behavior during a conversation, e.g. different strategies to recover from non-understanding (Yu et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the conventional approach of designing a dialog manager (Williams and Young, 2007) does not
scale well to open-domain conversation models because of the vast quantity of possible decisions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, there has been a growing interest in applying encoder-decoder models (Sutskever et al., 2014) for modeling open-domain conversation (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2016a).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The basic approach treats a conversation as a transduction task, in which the dialog history is the source sequence and the next response is the target sequence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The model is then trained end-to-end on large conversation corpora using the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) objective without the need for manual crafting.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However recent research has found that encoder-decoder models tend to generate generic and dull responses (e.g., I don’t know), rather than meaningful and specific answers (Li et al., 2015; Serban et al., 2016b).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There have been many attempts to explain and solve this limitation, and they can be broadly divided into two categories (see Section 2 for details): (1) the first category argues that the dialog history is only one of the factors that decide the next response.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Other features should be extracted and provided to the models as conditionals in order to generate more specific responses (Xing et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016a); (2) the second category aims to improve the encoder-decoder model itself, including decoding with beam search and its variations (Wiseman and Rush, 2016), encouraging responses that have long-term payoff (Li et al., 2016b), etc.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Building upon the past work in dialog managers and encoder-decoder models, the key idea of this paper is to model dialogs as a one-to-many problem at the discourse level.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Previous studies indicate that there are many factors in open-domain dialogs that decide the next response, and it is nontrivial to extract all of them.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, given a similar dialog history (and other observed inputs), there may exist many valid responses (at the
654
discourse-level), each corresponding to a certain configuration of the latent variables that are not presented in the input.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To uncover the potential responses, we strive to model a probabilistic distribution over the distributed utterance embeddings of the potential responses using a latent variable (Figure 1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This allows us to generate diverse responses by drawing samples from the learned distribution and reconstruct their words via a decoder neural network.

"The variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) is one of the most popular frameworks for image generation.",2.2 Conditional Variational Autoencoder,[0],[0]
The basic idea of VAE is to encode the input x into a probability distribution z instead of a point encoding in the autoencoder.,2.2 Conditional Variational Autoencoder,[0],[0]
"Then VAE applies a decoder network to reconstruct the original input using samples from z. To generate images, VAE first obtains a sample of z from the prior distribution, e.g. N (0, I), and then produces an image via the decoder network.",2.2 Conditional Variational Autoencoder,[0],[0]

"Inspired by CVAE, we view the dialog contexts as the conditional attributes and adapt CVAE
to generate diverse responses instead of images.",2.2 Conditional Variational Autoencoder,[0],[0]

Since now the reconstruction of y is a part of the loss function, kgCVAE can more efficiently encode y-related information into z than discovering it only based on the surface-level x and c. Another advantage of kgCVAE is that it can output a highlevel label (e.g. dialog act) along with the wordlevel responses, which allows easier interpretation of the model’s outputs.",3.2 Knowledge-Guided CVAE (kgCVAE),[0],[0]
"A straightforward VAE with RNN decoder fails to encode meaningful information in z due to the vanishing latent variable problem (Bowman et al., 2015).",3.3 Optimization Challenges,[0],[0]

We found that CVAE suffers from the same issue when the decoder is an RNN.,3.3 Optimization Challenges,[0],[0]

"As a result, we propose a simple yet novel technique to tackle the vanishing latent variable problem: bag-of-word loss.",3.3 Optimization Challenges,[0],[0]
"The idea is to introduce
an auxiliary loss that requires the decoder network to predict the bag-of-words in the response x as shown in Figure 3(b).",3.3 Optimization Challenges,[0],[0]

The encoded context c is directly fed into the decoder networks as the initial state.,5.1 Experiments Setup,[0],[0]
"The hyperparameters of the baseline are the same as the ones reported in Section 4.2 and the baseline is trained to minimize the standard cross entropy loss of the decoder RNN model without any auxiliary loss.
",5.1 Experiments Setup,[0],[0]
"Also, to compare the diversity introduced by the stochasticity in the proposed latent variable versus the softmax of RNN at each decoding step, we generate N responses from the baseline by sam-
pling from the softmax.",5.1 Experiments Setup,[0],[0]

"Automatically evaluating an open-domain generative dialog model is an open research challenge (Liu et al., 2016).",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Following our one-tomany hypothesis, we propose the following metrics.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"We assume that for a given dialog context c, there existMc reference responses rj , j ∈",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]

"hi, i ∈",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"[1, N ].",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"The generalized responselevel precision/recall for a given dialog context is:
precision(c) =
∑N i=1maxj∈[1,Mc]d(rj , hi)

∑Mc j=1maxi∈[1,N ]d(rj , hi))
",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Mc
where d(rj , hi) is a distance function which lies between 0 to 1 and measures the similarities between rj and hi.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"The final score is averaged over the entire test dataset and we report the performance with 3 types of distance functions in order to evaluate the systems from various linguistic points of view:
1.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Smoothed Sentence-level BLEU (Chen and Cherry, 2014): BLEU is a popular metric that measures the geometric mean of modified ngram precision with a length penalty (Papineni et al., 2002; Li et al., 2015).",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"We use BLEU-1 to 4 as our lexical similarity metric and normalize the score to 0 to 1 scale.
2.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Cosine Distance of Bag-of-word Embedding: a simple method to obtain sentence embeddings is to take the average or extrema of all the word embeddings in the sentences (Forgues et al., 2014; Adi et al., 2016).",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"The d(rj , hi) is the cosine distance of the two embedding vectors.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"We used Glove embedding described in Section 4 and denote the average method as A-bow and extrema method as E-bow.
3.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Dialog Act Match: to measure the similarity at the discourse level, the same dialogact tagger from 4.1 is applied to label all the generated responses of each model.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"We set d(rj , hi) = 1 if rj and hi have the same dialog acts, otherwise d(rj , hi) = 0.
",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"One challenge of using the above metrics is that there is only one, rather than multiple reference responses/contexts.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
This impacts reliability of our measures.,5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Inspired by (Sordoni et al., 2015), we utilized information retrieval techniques (see Appendix A) to gather 10 extra candidate reference responses/context from other conversations with the same topics.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Then the 10 candidate references are filtered by two experts, which serve as the ground truth to train the reference response classifier.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The result is 6.69 extra references in average per context.,5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The average number of distinct reference dialog acts is 4.2.,5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Table 1 shows the results.
",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The proposed models outperform the baseline in terms of recall in all the metrics with statistical significance.,5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
This confirms our hypothesis that generating responses with discourse-level diversity can lead to a more comprehensive coverage of the potential responses than promoting only word-level diversity.,5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"As for precision, we observed that the baseline has higher or similar scores than CVAE in all metrics, which is expected since the baseline tends to generate the mostly likely and safe responses repeatedly in the N hypotheses.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"However, kgCVAE is able to achieve the highest precision and recall in the 4 metrics at the same time (BLEU1-4, E-BOW).",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"One reason
for kgCVAE’s good performance is that the predicted dialog act label in kgCVAE can regularize the generation process of its RNN decoder by forcing it to generate more coherent and precise words.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
We further analyze the precision/recall of BLEU4 by looking at the average score versus the number of distinct reference dialog acts.,5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"A low number of distinct dialog acts represents the situation where the dialog context has a strong constraint on the range of the next response (low entropy), while a high number indicates the opposite (highentropy).",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Figure 4 shows that CVAE/kgCVAE achieves significantly higher recall than the baseline in higher entropy contexts.,5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Also it shows that CVAE suffers from lower precision, especially in low entropy contexts.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Finally, kgCVAE gets higher precision than both the baseline and CVAE in the full spectrum of context entropy.",5.2 Quantitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows the outputs generated from the baseline and kgCVAE.,5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"In example 1, caller A begins with an open-ended question.",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The kgCVAE model generated highly diverse answers that cover multiple plausible dialog acts.,5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Further, we notice that the generated text exhibits similar dialog acts compared to the ones predicted separately by the model, implying the consistency of natural language generation based on y.",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"On the contrary, the responses from the baseline model are limited to local n-gram variations and share a similar prefix, i.e. ”I’m”.",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Example 2 is a situation where caller A is telling B stories.,5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The ground truth response is a back-channel and the range of valid answers is more constrained than example 1 since B is playing the role of a listener.,5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The baseline successfully predicts ”uh-huh”.,5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The kgCVAE model is also able to generate various ways of back-channeling.,5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"This implies that the latent z is able to capture context-sensitive variations, i.e. in low-entropy dialog contexts modeling lexical diversity while in high-entropy ones modeling discourse-level diversity.",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Moreover, kgCVAE is occasionally able to
generate more sophisticated grounding (sample 4) beyond a simple back-channel, which is also an acceptable response given the dialog context.
",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"In addition, past work (Kingma and Welling, 2013) has shown that the recognition network is able to learn to cluster high-dimension data, so we conjecture that posterior z outputted from the recognition network should cluster the responses into meaningful groups.",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Figure 5 visualizes the posterior z of responses in the test dataset in 2D space using t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008).",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"We found that the learned latent space is highly correlated with the dialog act and length of responses, which confirms our assumption.",5.3 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of bag-ofword (BOW) loss for training VAE/CVAE with the RNN decoder.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"To compare with past work (Bowman et al., 2015), we conducted the same language modelling (LM) task on Penn Treebank using VAE.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
The network architecture is same except we use GRU instead of LSTM.,5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
We compared four different training setups: (1) standard VAE without any heuristics; (2) VAE with KL annealing (KLA); (3) VAE with BOW loss; (4) VAE with both BOW loss and KLA.,5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, a well trained model should lead to a low reconstruction loss and small but non-trivial KL cost.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"For all models with KLA, the KL weight increases linearly from 0 to 1 in the first 5000 batches.
",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows the reconstruction perplexity and the KL cost on the test dataset.,5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"The standard VAE fails to learn a meaningful latent variable by hav-
ing a KL cost close to 0 and a reconstruction perplexity similar to a small LSTM LM (Zaremba et al., 2014).",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"KLA helps to improve the reconstruction loss, but it requires early stopping since the models will fall back to the standard VAE after the KL weight becomes 1.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"At last, the models with BOW loss achieved significantly lower perplexity and larger KL cost.
",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
Figure 6 visualizes the evolution of the KL cost.,5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"We can see that for the standard model, the KL cost crashes to 0 at the beginning of training and never recovers.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"On the contrary, the model with only KLA learns to encode substantial information in latent z when the KL cost weight is small.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"However, after the KL weight is increased to 1 (after 5000 batch), the model once again decides to ignore the latent z and falls back to the naive implementation.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"The model with BOW loss, however, consistently converges to a non-trivial KL cost even without KLA, which confirms the importance of BOW loss for training latent variable models with the RNN decoder.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"Last but not least, our experiments showed that the conclusions drawn from LM using VAE also apply to training CVAE/kgCVAE, so we used BOW loss together with KLA for all previous experiments.",5.4 Results for Bag-of-Word Loss,[0],[0]
"In conclusion, we identified the one-to-many nature of open-domain conversation and proposed two novel models that show superior performance in generating diverse and appropriate responses at the discourse level.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"While the current paper addresses diversifying responses in respect to dialogue acts, this work is part of a larger research direction that targets leveraging both past linguistic findings and the learning power of deep neural networks to learn better representation of the latent factors in dialog.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"In turn, the output of this novel neural dialog model will be easier to explain and control by humans.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"In addition to dialog acts, we plan to apply our kgCVAE model to capture other different linguistic phenomena including sentiment, named entities,etc.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Last but not least, the recognition network in our model will serve as the foundation for designing a datadriven dialog manager, which automatically discovers useful high-level intents.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
All of the above suggest a promising research direction.,6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Variational Lower Bound for kgCVAE We assume that even with the presence of linguistic feature y regarding x, the prediction of xbow still only depends on the z and c. Therefore, we have:

"Secondly, for each dialog context in the test set, we retrieved the 10 nearest neighbors from the training set and treated the responses from the training set as candidate reference responses.",A Supplemental Material,[0],[0]
"Thirdly, we further sampled 240 context-responses pairs from 5481 pairs in the total test set and post-processed the selected candidate responses by two human computational linguistic experts who were told to give a binary label for each candidate response about whether the response is appropriate regarding its dialog context.",A Supplemental Material,[0],[0]
The filtered lists then served as the ground truth to train our reference response classifier.,A Supplemental Material,[0],[0]

pairs from both dialogue contexts and candidate reference responses with rare threshold for feature extraction being set to 20.",A Supplemental Material,[0],[0]

The task includes two important machine learning tasks as special cases: clustering and unsupervised hash learning.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Clustering is widely applied to data-driven application domains (Berkhin, 2006), while hash learning is popular for an approximate nearest neighbor search for large scale information retrieval (Wang et al., 2016).

"Deep neural networks are promising to be used thanks to their scalability and flexibility of representing complicated, non-linear decision boundaries.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, their model complexity is huge, and therefore, regularization of the networks is crucial to learn meaningful representations of data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Particularly, in unsupervised representation learning, target representations are not provided and hence, are unconstrained.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we need to carefully regularize the networks in order to learn useful representations that exhibit intended invariance for applications of interest (e.g., invariance to small perturbations or affine transformation).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Naı̈ve regularization to use is a weight decay (Erin Liong et al., 2015).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such regularization, however, encourages global smoothness of the function prediction; thus, may not necessarily impose the intended invariance on the predicted discrete representations.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead, in this paper, we use data augmentation to model the invariance of learned data representations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"More specifically, we map data points into their discrete representations by a deep neural network and regularize it by encouraging its prediction to be invariant to data augmentation.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The predicted discrete representations then exhibit the invariance specified by the augmentation.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our proposed regularization method is illustrated as red arrows in Figure 1.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As depicted, we encourage the predicted representations of augmented data points to be close to those of the original data points in an end-to-end fashion.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We term such regularization Self-Augmented Training (SAT).,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"SAT is inspired by the recent success in regularization of neural networks in semi-supervised learning (Bachman et al., 2014; Miyato et al., 2016; Sajjadi et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
SAT is flexible to impose various types of invariances on the representations predicted by neural networks.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, it is generally preferred for data representations to be locally invariant, i.e., remain unchanged under local perturbations on data points.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Using SAT, we can impose the local invariance on the representations by pushing the predictions of perturbed data points to be close to those of the original data points.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For image data, it may also be preferred for data representations to be invariant under affine distortion, e.g., rotation, scaling and parallel movement.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We can similarly impose the invariance via SAT by using the affine distortion for the data augmentation.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We then combine the SAT with the Regularized Information Maximization (RIM) for clustering (Gomes et al., 2010; Bridle et al., 1991), and arrive at our Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training (IMSAT), an information-theoretic method for learning discrete representations using deep neural networks.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We illustrate the basic idea of IMSAT in Figure 1.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Following the RIM, we maximize information theoretic dependency between inputs and their mapped outputs, while regularizing the mapping function.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
IMSAT differs from the original RIM in two ways.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, IMSAT deals with a more general setting of learning discrete representations; thus, is also applicable to hash learning.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, it uses a deep neural network for the mapping function and regularizes it in an end-to-end fashion via SAT.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Learning with our method can be performed by stochastic gradient descent (SGD); thus, scales well to large datasets.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In summary, our contributions are: 1) an informationtheoretic method for unsupervised discrete representation learning using deep neural networks with the end-to-end regularization, and 2) adaptations of the method to clustering and hash learning to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

"However, these methods can only model linear boundaries between different representations; thus, cannot fit to non-linear structures of data.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Kernel-based (Xu et al., 2004; Kulis & Darrell, 2009) and spectral (Ng et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2009) methods can model the non-linearity of data, but they are difficult to scale to large datasets.

Linear IMSAT (VAT) did not perform well even with the end-to-end regularization probably because the linear classifier was not flexible enough to model the intended invariance of the representations.,4.2.4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,[0],[0]

"The performance of IMSAT improved significantly when slightly bigger networks (200-200) were used, while the performance of Deep RIM did not improve much with the larger networks.",4.3.3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,[0],[0]
We deduce that this is because we can better model the local invariance by using more flexible networks.,4.3.3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS,[0],[0]

"By using second order information from the Hessian as in Saxe et al. (2013a), (here of the expected reconstruction loss with respect to the scalar weights), we relate the optimal learning rates for linear DAEs and WDAEs,
where each optimal rate is inversely related to the amount of noise/regularisation applied during training (see supplementary material).",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"The ratio of the optimal DAE rate to that for the WDAE is
R = 2λ+ γ
2λ+ 3ε .",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"(8)
Note that the ratio in (8) will essentially be equal to one for eigenvalues that are significantly larger than both ε and γ, with deviations from unity only manifesting for smaller values of λ.
",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, weight decay and noise injected learning result in equivalent scalar solutions when their parameters are related by γ = λελ+ε (see supplementary material).",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
This leads to the following two observations.,5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"First, it shows that adding noise during learning can be interpreted as a form of weight decay where the penalty parameter γ adapts to each direction of variation in the data.",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"In other words, noise essentially makes use of the statistical structure of
the input data to influence the amount of shrinkage that is being applied in various directions during learning.",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"Second, together with (8), we can theoretically compare the learning dynamics of DAEs and WDAEs, when both equivalent regularisation and the relative differences in optimal learning rates are taken into account.
",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"The effects of optimal learning rates (for λ = 1), are shown in Figure 3.",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"DAEs still exhibit faster dynamics (left panel), even when taking into account the difference in the learning rate as a function of noise, or equivalent weight decay (middle panel).",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"In addition, for equivalent regularisation effects, the ratio of the optimal rates R can be shown to be a monotonically decreasing function of the noise level, where the rate of decay depends on the size of λ.",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"This means that for any amount of added noise, the DAE will require a slower learning rate than that of the WDAE.",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"Even so, a faster rate for the WDAE does not seem to compensate for its slower dynamics and the difference in learning time is also shown to grow as more noise (regularisation) is applied during training (right panel).",5. The Relationship Between Noise and Weight Decay,[0],[0]
"A primary motivation for weight decay as a regulariser is that it provides solutions with smaller weight norms, producing smoother models that have better generalisation performance.",5.1. Exploiting invariance in the loss function,[0],[0]
Figure 4 shows the effect of noise (top row) compared to weight decay (bottom row) on the norm of the weights during learning.,5.1. Exploiting invariance in the loss function,[0],[0]
"Looking at the loss surface for weight decay (bottom left panel), the penalty on the size of the weights acts by shrinking the minimum loss manifold down from a long curving valley to a single point (associ-
ated with a small norm solution).",5.1. Exploiting invariance in the loss function,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, this results in gradient descent following a trajectory towards an “invisible” minimum loss manifold similar to the one associated with noise.",5.1. Exploiting invariance in the loss function,[0],[0]
"However, once on this manifold, weight decay begins to exploit invariances in the loss function to changes in the weights, so as to move along the manifold down towards smaller norm solutions.",5.1. Exploiting invariance in the loss function,[0],[0]
"This means that even when the two approaches learn the exact same mapping over time (as shown by the learning dynamics in the middle column of Figure 4), additional epochs will cause weight decay to further reduce the size of the weights (bottom right panel).",5.1. Exploiting invariance in the loss function,[0],[0]
This happens in a stage-like manner where the optimisation first focuses on reducing the reconstruction loss by learning the optimal mapping and then reduces the regularisation loss through invariance.,5.1. Exploiting invariance in the loss function,[0],[0]
It is common practice to initialise the weights of a network with small values.,5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"In fact, this strategy has recently been theoretically shown to help, along with early stopping, to ensure good generalisation performance for neural networks in certain high-dimensional settings (Advani & Saxe, 2017).",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"In our analysis however, what we find interesting about small weight initialisation is that it removes some of the differences in the learning behaviour of DAEs compared to regularised autoencoders that use weight decay.
",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"To see this, the magenta lines in Figure 4 show the learning dynamics for the two approaches where the weights of both the networks were initialised to small random starting values.",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"The learning dynamics are almost identical in terms of their temporal trajectories and have equal fixed
points.",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"However, what is interesting is the implicit regularisation that is brought about through the small initialisation.",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"By starting small and making incremental updates to the weights, the scalar solution in both cases end up being equal to the minimum norm solution.",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"In other words, the path that gradient descent takes from the initialisation to the minimum loss manifold, reaches the manifold where the norm of the weights happen to also be small.",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"This means that the second phase of weight decay (where the invariance of the loss function would be exploited to reduce the regularisation penalty), is not only no longer necessary, but also does not result in a norm that is appreciably smaller than that obtained by learning with added noise.",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"Therefore in this case, learning with explicit regularisation provides no additional benefit over that of learning with noise in terms of reducing the norm of the weights during training.
",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"When initialising small, early stopping can also serve as a form of implicit regularisation by ensuring that the weights do not change past the point where the validation loss starts to increase (Bengio et al., 2007).",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
"In the context of learning dynamics, early stopping for DAEs can be viewed as a method that effectively selects only the directions of variation deemed useful for generalisation during reconstruction, considering the remaining eigenvalues to carry no additional signal.",5.2. Small weight initialisation and early stopping,[0],[0]
To verify the dynamics of learning on real-world data sets we compared theoretical predictions with actual learning on MNIST and CIFAR-10.,6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"In our experiments we considered the following linear autoencoder networks: a regular AE, a WDAE and a DAE.
",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"For MNIST, we trained each autoencoder with small randomly initialised weights, using N = 50000 training samples for 5000 epochs, with a learning rate α = 0.01 and a hidden layer width ofH = 256.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"For the WDAE, the penalty parameter was set at γ = 0.5 and for the DAE, σ2 = 0.5.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"The results are shown in Figure 5 (left column).
",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
The theoretical predictions (solid lines) in Figure 5 show good agreement with the actual learning dynamics (points).,6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"As predicted, both regularisation (orange) and noise (green) suppress the fixed point value associated with the different eigenvalues and, whereas regularisation delays learning (fewer fixed points are reached by the WDAE during training when compared to the DAE), the use of noise has no effect on training time.
",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
Similar agreement is shown for CIFAR-10 in the right column of Figure 5.,6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"Here, we trained each network with small randomly initialised weights using N = 30000 training samples for 5000 epochs, with a learning rate α = 0.001 and a hidden dimension H = 512.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"For the WDAE, the
penalty parameter was set at γ = 0.5 and for the DAE, σ2 = 0.5.
",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"Next, we investigated whether these dynamics are at least also qualitatively present in nonlinear autoencoder networks.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"Figure 6 shows the dynamics of learning for nonlinear AEs, WDAEs and DAEs, using ReLU activations, trained on MNIST (N = 50000) and CIFAR-10 (N = 30000) with equal learning rates.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"For the DAE, the input was corrupted using sampled Gaussian noise with mean zero and σ2 = 3.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"For the WDAE, the amount of weight decay was manually tuned to γ = 0.0045, to ensure that both autoencoders displayed roughly the same degree of regularisation in terms of the fixed points reached.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"During the course of training, the identity mapping associated with each eigenvalue was estimated (see supplementary material), at equally spaced intervals of size 10 epochs.
",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"The learning dynamics are qualitatively similar to the dy-
namics observed in the linear case.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
Both noise and weight decay result in a shrinkage of the identity mapping associated with each eigenvalue.,6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, in terms of the number of training epochs, the DAE is seen to learn as quickly as a regular AE, whereas the WDAE incurs a delay in learning time.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"Although these experimental results stem from a single training run for each autoencoder, we note that wall-clock times for training may still differ because DAEs require some additional time for sampling noise.",6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
Similar results were observed when using a tanh nonlinearity and are provided in the supplementary material.,6. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
There have been many studies aiming to provide a better theoretical understanding of DAEs.,7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Vincent et al. (2008) analysed DAEs from several different perspectives, including manifold learning and information filtering, by establishing an equivalence between different criteria for learning and the original training criterion that seeks to minimise the reconstruction loss.",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Subsequently, Vincent (2011) showed that under a particular set of conditions, the training of DAEs can also be interpreted as a type of score matching.",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
This connection provided a probabilistic basis for DAEs.,7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Following this, a more in-depth analysis of DAEs as a possible generative model suitable for arbitrary loss functions and multiple types of data was given by Bengio et al. (2013).
",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast to a probabilistic understanding of DAEs, we present here an analysis of the learning process.",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Specifically inspired by Saxe et al. (2013a), as well as by earlier work on supervised neural networks (Opper, 1988; Sanger, 1989; Baldi & Hornik, 1989; Saad & Solla, 1995), we provide a theoretical investigation of the temporal behaviour of linear DAEs using derived equations that exactly describe their dynamics of learning.",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Specifically for the linear case, the squared error loss for the reconstruction contractive autoencoder (RCAE) introduced in Alain & Bengio (2014) is equivalent to the expected loss (over the noise) for the DAE.",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the learning dynamics described in this paper also apply to linear RCAEs.
",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
For our analysis to be tractable we used a marginalised reconstruction loss where the gradient descent dynamics are viewed in expectation over the noise distribution.,7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Whereas our motivation is analytical in nature, marginalising the reconstruction loss tends to be more commonly motivated from the point of view of learning useful and robust feature representations at a significantly lower computational cost (Chen et al., 2014; 2015).",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"This approach has also been investigated in the context of supervised learning (van der Maaten et al., 2013; Wang & Manning, 2013; Wager et al., 2013).",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Also related to our work is the analysis by Poole et al. (2014), who showed that training autoencoders with noise (added at different levels of the network architecture),
is closely connected to training with explicit regularisation and proposed a marginalised noise framework for noisy autoencoders.",7. Related Work,[0],[0]
This paper analysed the learning dynamics of linear denoising autoencoders (DAEs) with the aim of providing a better understanding of the role of noise during training.,8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"By deriving exact time-dependent equations for learning, we showed how noise influences the shape of the loss surface as well as the rate of convergence to fixed point solutions.",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We also compared the learning behaviour of added input noise to that of weight decay, an explicit form of regularisation.",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We found that while the two have similar regularisation effects, the use of noise for regularisation results in faster training.",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We compared our theoretical predictions with actual learning dynamics on real-world data sets, observing good agreement.",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"In addition, we also provided evidence (on both MNIST and CIFAR-10) that our predictions hold qualitatively for nonlinear DAEs.
",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
This work provides a solid basis for further investigation.,8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Our analysis could be extended to nonlinear DAEs, potentially using the recent work on nonlinear random matrix theory for neural networks (Pennington & Worah, 2017; Louart et al., 2017).",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Our findings indicate that appropriate noise levels help DAEs ignore low variance directions in the input; we also obtained new insights into the training time of DAEs.,8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Therefore, future work might consider how these insights could actually be used for tuning noise levels and predicting the training time of DAEs.",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"This would require further validation and empirical experiments, also on other datasets.",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, our analysis only considers the training dynamics, while a better understanding of generalisation and what influences the quality of feature representations during testing, are also of prime importance.",8. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]

"For a patient in a regular ward, the occurrence of any such event entails an unplanned transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU), the timing of which is a major determinant of the eventual outcome.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Indeed, recent medical studies have confirmed that delayed transfer to the ICU is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality (Mardini L, 2012; Mokart, 2013).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The problem of delayed ICU transfer is enormous and acute: over 750,000 septic shocks and 200,000 cardiac arrests occur in the U.S. each year with mortality rates of 28.6% and 75% respectively (Merchant et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2011).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"Motivated by the proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) (currently available in more than 75% of hospitals in the U.S. (Charles et al., 2016))",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
we develop a datadriven real-time risk score that can promptly assess a hospitalized patient’s risk of clinical deterioration.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our risk score hinges on a novel continuous-time semi-Markovmodulated marked Hawkes process model for a monitored patient’s episode, i.e. the patient’s evolving (latent) clinical states and her corresponding (observed) physiological data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"With the guidance of critical care experts, we conducted experiments on a dataset for a cohort of criticallyill patients admitted to a major academic medical center.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Results show that our risk score offers significant gains in the accuracy (and timeliness) of predicting clinical deterioration; our risk score attains a 23% improvement in the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) as compared to the technology currently deployed in our medical center.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since it confers a significant prognostic value in subacute care in wards, the proposed risk score is currently being installed in our medical center as a replacement for the current technology.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The proposed probabilistic model (based on which our risk score is computed) captures a hospitalized patient’s entire episode as recorded in the EHR.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A typical (critical care) patient episode comprises the time of her admission to the ward, the time of her admission to the ICU or discharge from the ward, and a temporal sequence of irregularly sampled physiological data that are collected during her stay in the ward (Johnson, 2016; Ghassemi et al., 2015).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We model
a patient’s episode as being driven by a latent clinical state process, which we represent as a semi-Markov jump process (Yu, 2010), describing the evolution of the patient’s “severity of illness” over time.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"All the observable physiological variables are modulated by this process: the times at which clinicians decide to observe the patient’s physiological data are drawn from a Hawkes point process (Hawkes & Oakes, 1974), the intensity of which is modulated by the patient’s clinical state process, whereas the observed physiological data is drawn from a switching multi-task Gaussian process with hyper-parameters that depend on the patient’s clinical state.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The patient episode is thus a marked Hawkes process –with the physiological data serving as the marks– that is modulated by the patient’s clinical states.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We provide a detailed description of the model in Section 3, and then propose an EM-based algorithm for learning its parameters from the EHR data in Section 4.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A distinctive feature of our model is its ability to incorporate informative clinical judgments into the generative process for the patient’s episode.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The manifestation of informative clinical judgments in the EHR episodes is doublefaceted: the patients’ episodes are both “informatively sampled” and “informatively censored”.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Informative sampling results from the fact that clinicians decide to observe the patient’s physiological data more intensely if they believe that the patient is in a “bad” clinical state (Moskovitch et al., 2015; Qin & Shelton, 2015)– a belief that is based on either the clinician’s own assessment of the patient’s state, or the communication between the patient and the ward staff (Kyriacos et al., 2014).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Informative censoring results from the clinicians’ decision on when to send the patient to the ICU or discharge her from the ward, which is indeed informative of the “ clinical deterioration” or “clinical stability” onsets.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In our model, informative censoring is taken into account by adopting an absorbing semi-Markov chain as a model for the patient’s latent clinical states; a patient’s risk score at any point of time is thus defined as the probability of eventual absorption in a “clinical deterioration” state.

"Marked point processes have been recently used in a very different context to model check-in data (Du et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2016), but we are not aware of any attempts for their deployment in the medical context.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most of the previous works on risk prognosis for critical care patients viewed informative censoring as a “surrogate label” for a patient’s clinical deterioration, and hence used those labels to train a supervised (regression) model using the physiological data in a fixed-size time window before censoring.",1.

"The supervised models used in the literature included logistic regression (Ho et al., 2012; Saria et al., 2010), SVMs (Wiens et al., 2012), Gaussian processes (Ghassemi et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2016) and recurrent neural networks (Che et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The main limitation of this approach is that, in addition to the fact that it gener-
ally does not deal with informatively sampled episodes, it does not model the entire patient’s physiological trajectory, and hence it does not accurately capture intermediate (subtle) deterioration stages that are indicative of future severe deterioration stages, which leads to a sluggish risk assessment and delayed ICU alarms.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Another strand of literature has focused on building probabilistic models, usually variants of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), for the entire patient’s physiological trajectories; applications have ranged from disease progression modeling to neonatal sepsis prediction (Wang et al., 2014; Stanculescu et al., 2014).",1.

"In (Henry et al., 2015), a ranking algorithm was used to construct a risk score for sepsis shocks; however, the approach therein requires the clinicians to provide assessments that order the disease severity at different time instances– we typically do not have such data in the EHR for ward patients.

"More recently, a data-driven medical risk score based on a simple regression model, known as the Rothman index, has been developed and commercialized (Finlay et al., 2014; Rothman et al., 2013).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The Rothman index is currently deployed in various major hospitals in the U.S. including our medical center; in Section 5, we show that our risk score significantly outperforms the Rothman index in terms of AUROC and timeliness of ICU admission alarms.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The subacute care data in an EHR typically comprises a set of episodes; each episode is a sequence of vital signs and lab tests (physiological data) that have been gathered (by clinicians) for a hospitalized patient at irregularly spaced time instances during her stay in a ward.,2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"The episode starts at the time of admission to the ward, and is concluded by either an unplanned admission to the ICU, which means that the patient was clinically deteriorating, or a discharge from the ward, which means that the patient was clinically stable.",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"We denote an EHR dataset D that comprises the episodes for D patients as D = {Ed}Dd=1, where Ed is the episode for the dth patient, and is defined as
Ed = ({ydm, tdm} Md m=1, T d c , l d), with ydm being the m th Qdimensional physiological variable (vital signs and lab test outcomes) for patient d observed at time tdm, and the total number of samples observed for that patient during her episode is Md.",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"The duration of patient d’s stay in the ward is denoted by T dc , whereas her endpoint outcome (clinical deterioration and ICU admission, or clinical stability and discharge) is declared via a binary variable ld; the realization ld = 1 means that patient d was admitted to the ICU, and ld = 0 means that the patient was discharged home.",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"We stress that the labels ld associated with every episode are neither noisy nor entirely subjective: we assign a label ld = 1 for patients who actually needed a therapeutic intervention in the ICU after an unplanned admission, and assign a label ld = 0 for patients who were discharged and not re-admitted shortly after.",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
We excluded all post-surgical ward patients for whom an ICU admission was preordained since for those patients the prognosis problem is not relevant.,2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"Our dataset comprises thousands of episodes for patients admitted to a large medical center over a 3-year period; all the episodes display the structure described above.
",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
The clinicians were right!,2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"Clinical judgments manifest in the dth episode of D through informative sampling (encoded in the observation times {tdm} Md m=1), and informative censoring (encoded in the episode duration T dc and the endpoint outcome l d).",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
Figure 1 is a depiction for both informative sampling and informative censoring.,2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"In Figure 1, we estimate the physiological data (time-varying) sampling rate using all the episodes in our dataset over a time horizon of 35 hours before ICU admission for deteriorating patients (i.e. patients with ld = 1, with t = 0 being the ICU admission time), and we compute the same estimates for stable patients (i.e. patients with ld = 0, with t = 0 being the discharge time).
",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"We can see from the trends in Figure 1 that as the deteriorating patient approaches the ICU admission time, the clinicians tend to sample her physiological data more intensely, whereas as the stable patient approaches the discharge time, the clinicians tend to have a more relaxed schedule for observing her vital signs and lab tests.",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
The divergence between the sampling rates for deteriorating and stable patient groups increases as the patients approach their ICU admission and discharge onsets– that is because the clinicians become less uncertain about the patient’s state as time progresses.,2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"We have tested the hypothesis that the sampling rate of deteriorating patients is –on average– larger than that for stable patients in the last 24 hours before ICU admission or discharge via a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05, and the hypothesis was accepted.
",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"The take-away from Figure 1 is that the clinician’s judgment of the patient’s clinical state –manifesting in the vital signs and lab tests sampling rates– is very predictive of the
endpoint outcomes.",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]
"This implies that there is a room for “learning from the informative clinical judgments”; that is, one can infer the patients’ latent states over time by using the clinicians’ observable sampling patterns as proximal noisy labels for those latent states.",2. Structure of the EHR Data,[0],[0]

Learning sentence representations is central to many natural language modeling applications.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The aim of a model for this task is to learn fixedlength feature vectors that encode the semantic and syntactic properties of sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Deep learning techniques have shown promising performance on sentence modeling, via feedforward neural networks (Huang et al., 2013), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014; Shen et al., 2014), and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Most of these models are task-dependent: they are trained specifically for a certain task.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, these methods may be-
come inefficient when we need to repeatedly learn sentence representations for a large number of different tasks, because they may require retraining a new model for each individual task.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, in contrast, we are primarily interested in learning generic sentence representations that can be used across domains.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Several approaches have been proposed for learning generic sentence embeddings.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The paragraphvector model of Le and Mikolov (2014) incorporates a global context vector into the log-linear neural language model (Mikolov et al., 2013) to learn the sentence representation; however, at prediction time, one needs to perform gradient descent to compute a new vector.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The sequence autoencoder of Dai and Le (2015) describes an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the input sentence, while the skip-thought model of Kiros et al. (2015) extends the encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an input sentence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Both the encoder and decoder of the methods above are modeled as RNNs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"CNNs have recently achieved excellent results in various task-dependent natural language applications as the sentence encoder (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014; Hu et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This motivates us to propose a CNN encoder for learning generic sentence representations within the framework of encoder-decoder models proposed by Sutskever et al. (2014); Cho et al. (2014).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, a CNN encoder performs convolution and pooling operations on an input sentence, then uses a fullyconnected layer to produce a fixed-length encoding of the sentence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This encoding vector is then fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent network to produce a target sentence.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Depending on the task, we propose three models: (i)",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"CNNLSTM autoencoder: this model seeks to reconstruct the original input sentence, by capturing the intra-sentence information; (ii) CNN-LSTM future
2390
predictor: this model aims to predict a future sentence, by leveraging inter-sentence information; (iii) CNN-LSTM composite model: in this case, there are two LSTMs, decoding the representation to the input sentence itself and a future sentence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This composite model aims to learn a sentence encoder that captures both intra- and inter-sentence information.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The proposed CNN-LSTM future predictor model only considers the immediately subsequent sentence as context.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In order to capture longerterm dependencies between sentences, we further introduce a hierarchical encoder-decoder model.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This model abstracts the RNN language model of Mikolov et al. (2010) to the sentence level.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"That is, instead of using the current word in a sentence to predict future words (sentence continuation), we encode a sentence to predict multiple future sentences (paragraph continuation).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This model is termed hierarchical CNN-LSTM model.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As in Kiros et al. (2015), we first train our proposed models on a large collection of novels.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We then evaluate the CNN sentence encoder as a generic feature extractor for 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking and 5 standard classification benchmarks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In these experiments, we train a linear classifier on top of the extracted sentence features, without additional fine-tuning of the CNN.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that our trained sentence encoder yields generic repre-
sentations that perform as well as, or better, than those of Kiros et al. (2015); Hill et al. (2016), in all the tasks considered.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Summarizing, the main contribution of this paper is a new class of CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder models that is able to leverage the vast quantity of unlabeled text for learning generic sentence representations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Inspired by the skip-thought model (Kiros et al., 2015), we have further explored different variants: (i) CNN is used as the sentence encoder rather than RNN; (ii) larger context windows are considered: we propose the hierarchical CNN-LSTM model to encode a sentence for predicting multiple future sentences.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Consider the sentence pair (sx, sy).",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The encoder, a CNN, encodes the first sentence sx into a feature vector z, which is then fed into an LSTM decoder that predicts the second sentence sy.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
Let wtx ∈,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"{1, . . .",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
", V } represent the t-th word in sentences sx, where wtx indexes one element in a V - dimensional set (vocabulary); wty is defined similarly w.r.t.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
sy.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Each word wtx is embedded into a k-dimensional vector xt = We[wtx], where We ∈ Rk×V is a word embedding matrix (learned), and notation We[v] denotes the v-th column of matrix We.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Similarly, we let yt = We[wty].
CNN encoder The CNN architecture in Kim (2014); Collobert et al. (2011) is used for sentence encoding, which consists of a convolution layer and a max-pooling operation over the entire sentence for each feature map.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"A sentence of length T (padded where necessary) is represented as a matrix X ∈ Rk×T , by concatenating its word embeddings as columns, i.e., the t-th column of X is xt.
",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
A convolution operation involves a filter Wc ∈,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Rk×h, applied to a window of h words to produce a new feature.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"According to Collobert et al. (2011), we can induce one feature map c = f(X ∗Wc + b) ∈ RT−h+1, where f(·) is a nonlinear activation function such as the hyperbolic tangent used in our experiments, b ∈ RT−h+1 is a bias vector, and ∗ denotes the convolutional operator.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
Convolving the same filter with the h-gram at every position in the sentence allows the features to be extracted independently of their position in the sentence.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"We then apply a max-over-time pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) to the feature map and take its maximum value, i.e., ĉ = max{c}, as the feature corresponding to this particular filter.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"This pooling scheme tries to capture the most important feature, i.e., the one with the highest value, for each feature map, effectively filtering out less informative compositions of words.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Further, pooling also guarantees that the extracted features are independent of the length of the input sentence.
",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
The above process describes how one feature is extracted from one filter.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"In practice, the model uses multiple filters with varying window sizes (Kim, 2014).",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Each filter can be considered as a linguistic feature detector that learns to recognize a specific class of n-grams (or h-grams, in the above notation).",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"However, since the h-grams are computed in the embedding space, the model naturally handles similar h-grams composed of synonyms.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Assume we have m window sizes, and for each window size, we use d filters; then we obtain a md-dimensional vector to represent a sentence.
",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Compared with the LSTM encoders used in Kiros et al. (2015); Dai and Le (2015); Hill et al. (2016), a CNN encoder may have the following advantages.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"First, the sparse connectivity of a CNN, which indicates fewer parameters are required, typically improves its statistical efficiency as well as reduces memory requirements (Goodfellow et al., 2016).",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"For example, excluding the number of parameters used in the word embeddings, our trained CNN sentence encoder has 3 million parameters,
while the skip-thought vector of Kiros et al. (2015) contains 40 million parameters.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Second, a CNN is easy to implement in parallel over the whole sentence, while an LSTM needs sequential computation.
",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
LSTM decoder The CNN encoder maps sentence sx into a vector z.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The probability of a length-T sentence sy given the encoded feature vector z is defined as
p(sy|z) =",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"T∏

", wt−1y , z) (1)
where w0y is defined as a special start-of-thesentence token.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"All the words in the sentence are sequentially generated using the RNN, until the end-of-the-sentence symbol is generated.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Specifically, each conditional p(wty|w<ty , z), where < t = {0, . . .",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
", t− 1}, is specified as softmax(Vht), where ht, the hidden units, are recursively updated through ht = H(yt−1,ht−1, z), and h0 is defined as a zero vector (h0 is not updated during training).",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
V is a weight matrix used for computing a distribution over words.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
Bias terms are omitted for simplicity throughout the paper.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The transition function H(·) is implemented with an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).
",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Given the sentence pair (sx, sy), the objective function is the sum of the log-probabilities of the target sentence conditioned on the encoder representation in (1): ∑T t=1 log p(w t y|w<ty , z).",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The total objective is the above objective summed over all the sentence pairs.
",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Applications Inspired by Srivastava et al. (2015), we propose three models: (i) an autoencoder, (ii) a future predictor, and (iii) the composite model.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"These models share the same CNN-LSTM model architecture, but are different in terms of the choices of the target sentence.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"An illustration of the proposed encoder-decoder models is shown in Figure 1(left).
",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
The autoencoder (i) aims to reconstruct the same sentence as the input.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The intuition behind this is that an autoencoder learns to represent the data using features that explain its own important factors of variation, and hence model the internal structure of sentences, effectively capturing the intrasentence information.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
Another natural task is encoding an input sentence to predict the subsequent sentence.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The future predictor (ii) achieves this, effectively capturing the inter-sentence information,
which has been shown to be useful to learn the semantics of a sentence (Kiros et al., 2015).",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"These two tasks can be combined to create a composite model (iii), where the CNN encoder is asked to learn a feature vector that is useful to simultaneously reconstruct the input sentence and predict a future sentence.",2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
This composite model encourages the sentence encoder to incorporate contextual information both within and beyond the sentence.,2.1 CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
The future predictor described in Section 2.1 only considers the immediately subsequent sentence as context.,2.2 Hierarchical CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"By utilizing a larger surrounding context, it is likely that we can learn even higher-quality sentence representations.",2.2 Hierarchical CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Inspired by the standard RNN-based language model (Mikolov et al., 2010) that uses the current word to predict future words, we propose a hierarchical encoder-decoder model that encodes the current sentence to predict multiple future sentences.",2.2 Hierarchical CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"An illustration of the hierarchical model is shown in Figure 1(right), with details provided in Figure 2.
",2.2 Hierarchical CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
Our proposed hierarchical model characterizes the hierarchy word-sentence-paragraph.,2.2 Hierarchical CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"A paragraph is modeled as a sequence of sentences, and each sentence is modeled as a sequence of words.",2.2 Hierarchical CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Specifically, assume we are given a paragraph D = (s1, . . .",2.2 Hierarchical CNN-LSTM model,[0],[0]

"Various methods have been proposed for sentence modeling, which generally fall into two categories.",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"The first consists of models trained specifically for a certain task, typically combined with downstream applications.",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Several models have been proposed along this line, ranging from simple additional composition of the word vectors (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Yu and Dredze, 2015; Iyyer et al., 2015) to those based on complex nonlinear functions like recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2011, 2013), convolutional neural networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Gan et al., 2017), and recurrent neural networks (Tai et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2017).
",3 Related work,[0],[0]
The other category consists of methods aiming to learn generic sentence representations that can be used across domains.,3 Related work,[0],[0]
"This includes the paragraph vector (Le and Mikolov, 2014), skip-thought vector (Kiros et al., 2015), and the sequential denoising autoencoders (Hill et al., 2016).",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Hill et al. (2016) also proposed a sentence-level log-linear bag-of-words (BoW) model, where a BoW representation of an input sentence is used to predict adjacent sentences that are also represented as BoW. Most recently, Wieting et al. (2016); Arora et al. (2017); Pagliardini et al. (2017) proposed methods in which sentences are represented as a weighted average of fixed (pre-trained) word vectors.",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our model falls into this category, and is most related to Kiros et al. (2015).
",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"However, there are two key aspects that make our model different from Kiros et al. (2015).",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"First, we use CNN as the sentence encoder.",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"The combination of CNN and LSTM has been considered in image captioning (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015), and in some recent work on machine translation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Meng et al., 2015; Gehring et al., 2016).",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our utilization of a CNN is different, and more importantly, the ultimate goal of our model is different.",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our work aims to use a CNN to learn generic sentence embeddings.
",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Second, we use the hierarchical CNN-LSTM model to predict multiple future sentences, rather than the surrounding two sentences as in Kiros et al. (2015).",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Utilizing a larger context window aids our model to learn better sentence representations, capturing longer-term dependencies between sentences.",3 Related work,[0],[0]
Similar work to this hierarchical language modeling can be found in Li et al. (2015); Sordoni et al. (2015); Lin et al. (2015); Wang and Cho (2016).,3 Related work,[0],[0]
"Specifically, Li et al. (2015); Sordoni et al. (2015) uses an LSTM for the sentence encoder, while Lin et al. (2015) uses a bag-of-words to represent sentences.",3 Related work,[0],[0]
"We first provide qualitative analysis of our CNN encoder, and then present experimental results on 8 tasks: 5 classification benchmarks, paraphrase detection, semantic relatedness and image-sentence ranking.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"As in Kiros et al. (2015), we evaluate the capabilities of our encoder as a generic feature extractor.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To further demonstrate the advantage of our learned generic sentence representations, we also fine-tune our trained sentence encoder on the 5 clas-
sification benchmarks.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"All the CNN-LSTM models are trained using the BookCorpus dataset (Zhu et al., 2015), which consists of 70 million sentences from over 7000 books.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We train four models in total: (i) an autoencoder, (ii) a future predictor, (iii) the composite model, and (iv) the hierarchical model.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the CNN encoder, we employ filter windows (h) of sizes {3,4,5} with 800 feature maps each, hence each sentence is represented as a 2400-dimensional vector.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]

",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The CNN-LSTM models are trained with a vocabulary size of 22,154 words.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In order to learn a generic sentence encoder that can encode a large number of possible words, we use two methods of considering words not in the training set.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Suppose we have a large pretrained word embedding matrix, such as the publicly available word2vec vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013), in which all test words are assumed to reside.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The first method learns a linear mapping between the word2vec embedding space Vw2v and the learned word embedding space Vcnn by solving a linear regression problem (Kiros et al., 2015).",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Thus, any word from Vw2v can be mapped into Vcnn for encoding sentences.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The second method fixes the word vectors in Vcnn as the corresponding word vectors in Vw2v , and we do not update the word embedding parameters during training.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Thus, any word vector from Vw2v can be naturally used to encode sentences.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"By doing this, our trained sentence encoder can successfully encode 931,331 words.

It demonstrates that the arithmetic operations on the sentence representations correspond to wordlevel addition and subtractions.,4.1 Qualitative analysis,[0],[0]
"For instance, in the 3rd example, our encoder captures that the difference between sentence B and C is “you"" and “him"", so that the former word in sentence A is replaced by the latter (i.e., “you”-“you”+“him”=“him”), resulting in sentence D.

"Our combined model, which concatenates the feature vectors learned from both the hierarchical model and the composite model, performs the best.",4.2 Quantitative evaluations,[0],[0]

"How to construct the dynamical infectivity network among different companies from the SDC event sequences is still an open problem.

"Applying our data synthesis method, we can stitch different users’ job hopping sequences based on their ages (time stamps) and their profile (feature) and learn the dynamical network of company over time.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"In particular, we select 100 users with relatively complete job hopping history (i.e., the range of their working experience is over 25 years) as testing set.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"The remaining 2, 900 users are randomly selected as training set.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]

"The properties of the network verifies the rationality of our results: 1) the diagonal elements of the adjacent matrix are larger than other elements in general, which reflects the fact that most employees would like to stay in the same company and achieve a series of internal promotions; 2) with the increase of age, the infectivity network becomes sparse, which reflects the fact that users are more likely to try different companies in the early stages of their careers.

",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we visualize the adjacent matrix of dynamical network of disease categories in Fig. 6(b).",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"We can find that: 1) with the increase of age the disease network becomes dense, which reflects the fact that the complications of diseases are more and more common when people become old; 2) the networks show that neoplasms and the diseases of circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems have strong self-triggering patterns because the treatments of these diseases often include several phases and require patients to make admission multiple times; 3) for kids and teenagers, their disease networks (i.e., “Age 0” and “Age 10” networks) are very sparse, and their common diseases mainly include neoplasms and the diseases of circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems; 4) for middle-aged people, the reasons for their admissions are diverse and complicated so that their disease networks are dense and include many mutually-triggering patterns; 5) for longevity people, their disease networks (i.e., “Age 80” and “Age 90” networks) are relatively sparser than those of middle-aged people, because their admissions are generally caused by elderly chronic diseases.

"Additionally, we visualize the dynamical networks of the diseases of circulatory systems in Fig. 7, and find some interesting triggering patterns.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"For example, for kids (“Age 0” network), the typical circulatory diseases are “diseases of mitral and aortic valves” (ICD-9 396) and “cardiac dysrhythmias” (ICD-9 427), which are common for premature babies and the kids having congenital heart disease.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"For the old (“Age 80” network), the network becomes dense.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"We can find that 1) as a main cause of death, “heart failure” (ICD-9 428) is triggered via multiple other diseases, especially “secondary hypertension” (ICD-9 405); 2) “sec-
ondary hypertension” is also likely to cause “other and illdefined cerebrovascular disease” (ICD-9 437); 3) “Hemorrhoids” (ICD-9 455), as a common disease with strong self-triggering pattern, will cause frequent admissions of patients.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]
"In summary, the analysis above verifies the rationality of our result — the dynamical disease networks we learned indeed reflect the properties of human’s health trajectory.",5.3. Real-World Data,[0],[0]

"For most Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, obtaining sufficient annotated text for training accurate models is a critical bottleneck.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus active learning has been applied to NLP tasks to minimise the expense of annotating data (Thompson et al., 1999; Tong and Koller, 2001; Settles and Craven, 2008).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Active learning aims to reduce cost by identifying a subset of unlabelled data for annotation, which is selected to maximise the accuracy of a supervised model trained on the data (Settles, 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There have been many successful applications to NLP, e.g., Tomanek et al. (2007) used an active learning algorithm for CoNLL corpus to get an F1 score 84% with a reduction of annotation cost of about 48%.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In prior work most active learning algorithms are designed for English based on
heuristics, such as using uncertainty or informativeness.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There has been comparatively little work done about how to learn the active learning strategy itself.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It is no doubt that active learning is extremely important for other languages, particularly lowresource languages, where annotation is typically difficult to obtain, and annotation budgets more modest (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such settings are a natural application for active learning, however there is little work to this end.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A potential reason is that most active learning algorithms require a substantial ‘seed set’ of data for learning a basic classifier, which can then be used for active data selection.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, given the dearth of data in the low-resource setting, this assumption can make standard approaches infeasible.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper,1 we propose PAL, short for Policy based Active Learning, a novel approach for learning a dynamic active learning strategy from data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This allows for the strategy to be applied in other data settings, such as cross-lingual applications.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our algorithm does not use a fixed heuristic, but instead learns how to actively select data, formalised as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An intelligent agent must decide whether or not to select data for annotation in a streaming setting, where the decision policy is learned using a deep Q-network (Mnih et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The policy is informed by observations including sentences’ content information, the supervised model’s classifications and its confidence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Accordingly, a rich and dynamic policy can be learned for annotating new data based on the past sequence of annotation decisions.

Our work is different for prior work in active learning for NLP.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Most previous active learning algorithms developed for NER tasks is based on one language and then applied to the language itself.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 2, we briefly review some related work.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 3, we present active learning algorithms, which cross multiple languages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The experimental results are presented in Section 4.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We conclude our work in Section 5.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As supervised learning methods often require a lot of training data, active learning is a technique that selects a subset of data to annotate for training the best classifier.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Existing active learning (AL) algorithms can be generally considered as three categories: 1) uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Tong and Koller, 2001), which selects the data about which the current classifier is the most uncertain; 2) query by committee (Seung et al., 1992), which selects the data about which the “committee” disagree most; and 3) expected error reduction (Roy and McCallum, 2001), which selects the data that can contribute the largest model loss reduction for the current classifier once labelled.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Applications of active learning to NLP include text classification (McCallumzy and Nigamy, 1998; Tong and Koller, 2001), relation classification (Qian et al., 2014), and structured prediction (Shen et al., 2004; Settles and Craven, 2008; Stratos and Collins, 2015; Fang and Cohn, 2017).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Qian et al. used uncertainty sampling to jointly perform on English and Chinese.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Stratos and Collins and Zhang et al. deployed uncertainty-based AL algorithms for languages with the minimal supervision.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a general-purpose framework for decision making based on representation learning.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Recently, there are some notable examples include deep Qlearning (Mnih et al., 2015), deep visuomotor policies (Levine et al., 2016), attention with recurrent networks (Ba et al., 2015), and model predictive control with embeddings (Watter et al., 2015).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Other important works include massively parallel frameworks (Nair et al., 2015), dueling architecture (Wang et al., 2016) and expert move prediction in the game of Go (Maddison et al., 2015), which produced policies matching those of the Monte Carlo tree search programs, and squarely beaten a professional player when combined with search (Silver et al., 2016).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
DRL has been also studied in NLP tasks.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"For example, recently, DRL has been studied for information extraction problem (Narasimhan et al., 2016).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
They designed a framework that can decide to acquire external evidence and the framework is under the reinforcement learning method.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"However, there has been fairly little work on using DRL to learn active learning strategies for language processing tasks, especially in cross-lingual settings.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Recent deep learning work has also looked at transfer learning (Bengio, 2012).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"More recent work in deep learning has also considered transferring policies by reusing policy parameters between environments (Parisotto et al., 2016; Rusu et al., 2016), using either regularization or novel neural network architectures, though this work has not looked at transfer active learning strategies between languages with shared feature space in state.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"We now show how active learning can be formalised as as a decision process, and then show how this allows for the active learning selection policy to be learned from data using deep reinforcement learning.",3 Methodology,[0],[0]
Later we introduce a method for transferring the policy between languages.,3 Methodology,[0],[0]
"Active learning is a simple technique for labelling data, which involves first selecting some instances from an unlabelled dataset, which are then annotated by a human oracle, which is then repeated many times until a termination criterion is satisfied, e.g., the annotation budget is exhausted.",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"Most often the selection function is based on the pre-
dictions of a trained model, which has been fit to the labelled dataset at each stage in the algorithm, where datapoints are selected based on the model’s predictive uncertainty (Lewis and Gale, 1994), or divergence in predictions over an ensemble (Seung et al., 1992).",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"The key idea of these methods is to find the instances on which the model is most likely to make errors, such that after their labelling and inclusion in the training set, the model becomes more robust to these types of errors on unseen data.

"The steps in active learning can be viewed as a decision process, a means of formalising the active learning algorithm as a sequence of decisions, where the stages of active learning correspond to the state of the system.",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"Accordingly, the state corresponds to the selected data for labelling and their labels, and each step in the active learning algorithm corresponds to a selection action, wherein the heuristic selects the next items from a pool.",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"This process terminates when the budget is exhausted.
",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"Effectively the active learning heuristic is operating as a decision policy, a form of function taking as input the current state — comprising the labelled data, from which a model is trained — and a candidate unlabelled data point — e.g., the model uncertainty.",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"This raises the opportunity to consider general policy functions, based on the state and data point inputs, and resulting in a labelling decision, and, accordingly a mechanism for learning such functions from data.",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"We now elaborate on the components of this process, namely the formulation of the decision process, architecture of the policy function, and means of learning the decision policy automatically from data.",3.1 Active learning as a decision process,[0],[0]
"For simplicity, we make a streaming assumption, whereby unlabelled data (sentences) arrive in a stream (Lewis and Gale, 1994).2 As each instance arrives, an agent must decide the action to take, namely whether or not the instance should be manually annotated.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"This process is illustrated in Figure 1, which illustrates the space of decision sequences for a small corpus.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"As part of this process, a separate model, pφ, is trained on the labelled data, and updated accordingly as the labelled dataset is expanded as new annotations ar-

rive.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"This model is central to the policy for choosing the labelling actions at each stage, and for determining the reward for a sequence of actions.
",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"This is a form of Markov Decision Process (MDP), which allows the learning of a policy that can dynamically select instances that are most informative.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"As illustrated in Figure 1 at each time, the agent observes the current state si which includes the sentence xi, and the learned model φ.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"The agent selects a binary action ai, denoting whether to label xi, according to the policy π.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"For ai = 1, the corresponding sentence is labelled and added to the labelled data, and the model pφ updated to include this new training point.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"The process then repeats, terminating when either the dataset is exhausted or a fixed annotation budget is reached.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"After termination a reward is computed based on the accuracy of the final model, φ.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
"We represent the MDP framework as a tuple 〈S,A, Pr(si+1|si, a), R〉, where S = {s} is the space of all possible states, A = {0, 1} is the set of actions, R(s, a) is the reward function, and Pr(si+1|si, a) is the transition function.",3.2 Stream-based learning,[0],[0]
The state at time i comprises the candidate instance being considered for annotation and the labelled dataset constructed in steps 1 . . .,3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"i. We represent the state using a continuous vector, using the concatenation of the vector representation of xi, and outputs of the model pφ trained over the labelled data.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"These outputs use both the predictive marginal distributions of the model on the instance, and a representation of the model’s confidence.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"We now elaborate on each component.
",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"Content representation A key input to the agent is the content of the sentence, xi, which we encode using a convolutional neural network to arrive at a fixed sized vector representation, following Kim (2014).",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"This involves embedding each of the n words in the sentence to produce a matrix Xi = {xi,1, xi,2, · · · , xi,n}, after which a series of wide convolutional filters is applied, using multiple filters with different gram sizes.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
Each filter uses a linear transformation with a rectified linear unit activation function.,3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"Finally the filter outputs are merged using a max-pooling operation to yield a hidden state hc, which is used to represent the sentence.
",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"Representation of marginals The prediction outputs of the training model, pφ(y|xi), are central to all active learning heuristics, and accordingly, we include this in our approach.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"In order to generalise existing techniques, we elect to use the predictive marginals directly, rather than only using statistics thereof, e.g., entropy.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"This generality allows for different and more nuanced concepts to be learned, including patterns of probabilities that span several adjacent positions in the sentence (e.g., the uncertainty about the boundary of a named entity).
",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"We use another convolutional neural network to process the predictive marginals, as shown in Figure 2.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"The convolutional layer contains j filters with ReLU activation, based on a window of width 3 and height equal to the number of classes, and with a stride of one token.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"We use a wide convolution, by padding the input matrix to either size with vectors of zeros.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"These j feature maps are then subsampled with mean pooling, such that the network is easily able to capture the average uncertainty in each window.",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"The final hidden layer he is used to represent the predictive marginals.
",3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
Confidence of sequential prediction The last component is a score C which indicates the confidence of the model prediction.,3.2.1 State,[0],[0]
"This is defined based on the most probable label sequence under the model, e.g., using Viterbi algorithm with a CRF, and the probability of this sequence is used to represent the confidence, C = n √

"We now turn to the action, which denotes whether the human oracle must annotate the current sentence.",3.2.2 Action,[0],[0]
"The agent selects either to annotate xi, in which case ai = 1, or not, with ai = 0, after which the agent proceeds to consider the next instance, xi+1.",3.2.2 Action,[0],[0]
"When action ai = 1 is chosen, an oracle is requested to annotate the sentence, and the newly annotated sentence is added to the training data, and φ updated accordingly.",3.2.2 Action,[0],[0]
"A special ‘terminate’ option applies when no further data remains or the annotation budget is exhausted, which concludes the active learning run (referred to as an ‘episode’ or ‘game’ herein).",3.2.2 Action,[0],[0]
"The training signal for learning the policy takes the form of a scalar ‘reward’, which provides feedback on the quality of the actions made by the agent.",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"The most obvious reward is to wait for a game to conclude, then measure the held-out performance of the model, which has been trained on the labelled data.",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"However, this reward is delayed, and is difficult to related to individual actions after a long game.",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"To compensate for this,
we use reward shaping, whereby small intermediate rewards are assigned which speeds up the learning process (Ng, 2003; Lample and Chaplot, 2016).",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"At each step, the intermediate reward is defined as the change in held-out performance, i.e., R(si−1, a) = Acc(φi)",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"− Acc(φi−1), where Acc denotes predictive accuracy (here F1 score), and φi is the trained model after action a has take place, which may include an additional training instance.",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"Accordingly, when considering the aggregate reward over a game, the intermediate terms cancel, such that the total reward measures the performance improvement over the whole game.",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"Note that the value of R(s, a) can be positive or negative, indicating a beneficial or detrimental effect on the performance.",3.2.3 Reward,[0],[0]
"There is a fixed budget B for the total number of instances annotated, which corresponds to the terminal state in the MDP.",3.2.4 Budget,[0],[0]
It is a predefined number and chosen according to time and cost constraints.,3.2.4 Budget,[0],[0]
"A game is finished when the data is exhausted or the budget reached, and with the final result being the dataset thus created, upon which the final model is trained.",3.2.4 Budget,[0],[0]
The remaining question is how the above components can be used to learn a good policy.,3.2.5 Reinforcement learning,[0],[0]

We illustrate the policy transfer algorithm in Algorithm 2.,3.3 Cross-lingual policy transfer,[0],[0]
"This algorithm is broadly similar to Algorithm 1, but has two key differences.",3.3 Cross-lingual policy transfer,[0],[0]
"Firstly, Algorithm 2 makes only one pass over the data, rather than several passes, as befits an application to a low-resource language where oracle labelling is costly.",3.3 Cross-lingual policy transfer,[0],[0]
"Secondly, the algorithm also assumes an initial policy, π, which is fine tuned during the episode based on held-out performance such that the policy can adapt to the test scenario.3",3.3 Cross-lingual policy transfer,[0],[0]
"The above transfer algorithm has some limitations, which may not be realistic for low-resource settings: the requirement for held-out evaluation data and the embedding of the oracle annotator inside the learning loop.",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
"The former implies more supervision than is ideal in a low-resource setting,
3Moreover, the algorithm can be extended to a traditional batch setting by evaluating a batch of data instances and selectinag the best k instances for labelling under the policy.",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
"This could be applied in either the transfer step (Algorithm 2) or initial policy training (Algorithm 1), or both.
while the latter places limitations on the communication with annotator as well as a necessity for real-time processing, both which are unlikely in a field linguistics setting.
",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
"For this data and- communication-impoverished setting, denoted as cold-start, we allow only one chance to request labels for the target data, and, having no held-out data, do not allow policy updates.",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
"The agent needs to select a batch of unlabelled target instances for annotations, but cannot use these resulting annotations or any other feedback to refine the selection.",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
"In this, more difficult cold-start setting, we bootstrap the process with an initial model, such that the agent can make informative decisions in the absence of feedback.
",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
The procedure is outlined in Algorithm 3.,3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
"Using the cross-lingual word embeddings, we transfer both a policy and a model into the target language.",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]

"Policy learning uses Alg 1, with the small change that in step 3 the model is initialised using φ.",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]
"Consequently the learned policy can exploit the knowledge from cross-lingual initialisation, such that it can figure out which aspects that need to be corrected using target annotated data.",3.4 Cold-start transfer,[0],[0]

We evaluate the cold-start setting in Figure 4.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Recall that in this setting there are no policy or model updates, as no heldout data is used, and all annotations arrive in a batch.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]

Active learning (AL) seeks to learn an accurate model with minimum amount of annotation cost.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It is inspired by the observation that a model can get better performance if it is allowed to choose the data points on which it is trained.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, the learner can identify the areas of the space where it does not have enough knowledge, and query those data points which bridge its knowledge gap.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Traditionally, AL is performed using engineered heuristics in order to estimate the usefulness of unlabeled data points as queries to an annotator.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent work (Fang et al., 2017; Bachman et al., 2017; Woodward and Finn, 2017) have focused on learning the AL querying strategy, as engineered heuristics are not flexible to exploit char-
acteristics inherent to a given problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The basic idea is to cast AL as a decision process, where the most informative unlabeled data point needs to be selected based on the history of previous queries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, previous works train for the AL policy by a reinforcement learning (RL) formulation, where the rewards are provided at the end of sequences of queries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This makes learning the AL policy difficult, as the policy learner needs to deal with the credit assignment problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, the learner needs to observe many pairs of query sequences and the resulting end-rewards to be able to associate single queries with their utility scores.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we formulate learning AL strategies as an imitation learning problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In particular, we consider the popular pool-based AL scenario, where an AL agent is presented with a pool of unlabelled data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Inspired by the Dataset Aggregation (DAGGER) algorithm (Ross et al., 2011), we develop an effective AL policy learning method by designing an efficient and effective algorithmic expert, which provides the AL agent with good decisions in the encountered states.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We then use a deep feedforward network to learn the AL policy to associate states to actions.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Unlike the RL approach, our method can get observations and actions directly from the expert’s trajectory.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, our trained policy can make better rankings of unlabelled datapoints in the pool, leading to more effective AL strategies.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We evaluate our method on text classification and named entity recognition.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The results show our method performs better than strong AL methods using heuristics and reinforcement learning, in that it boosts the performance of the underlying model with fewer labelling queries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
An open source implementation of our model is available at: https://github.com/Grayming/ ALIL.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We consider the popular pool-based AL setting where we are given a small set of initial labeled data and a large pool of unlabelled data, and a budget for getting the annotation of some unlabelled data by querying an oracle, e.g. a human annotator.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"The goal is to intelligently pick those unlabelled data for which if the annotations were available, the performance of the underlying re-trained model would be improved the most.
",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
The main challenge in AL is how to identify and select the most beneficial unlabelled data points.,2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"Various heuristics have been proposed to guide the unlabelled data selection (Settles, 2010).",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"However, there is no one AL heuristic which performs best for all problems.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"The goal of this paper is to provide an approach to learn an AL strategy which is best suited for the problem at hand, instead of resorting to ad-hoc heuristics.
",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"The AL strategy can be learned by attempting to actively learn on tasks sampled from a distribution over the tasks (Bachman et al., 2017).",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"The idea is to simulate the AL scenario on instances of the problem created using available labeled data, where the label of some part of the data is kept hidden.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"This allows to have an automatic oracle to reveal the labels of the queried data, resulting in an efficient way to quickly evaluate a hypothesised AL strategy.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"Once the AL strategy is learned on simulations, it is then applied to real AL scenarios.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"The more related are the tasks in the real scenario to those used to train the AL strategy, the more effective the AL strategy would be.
",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
We are interested to train a model mφ which maps an inputx ∈ X to its label y ∈,2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"Yx , where Yx is the set of labels for the input x and φ is the parameter vector of the underling model.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"For example, in the named entity recognition (NER) task, the input is a sentence and the output is its label sequence, e.g. in the IBO format.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"Let D = {(x,y)} be a support set of labeled data, which is randomly partitioned into labeledDlab, unlabelledDunl, and evaluation Devl datasets.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
Repeated random partitioning creates multiple instances of the AL problem.,2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"At each time step t of an AL problem, the algorithm interacts with the oracle and queries the label of a datapoint xt ∈ Dunlt .",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"As the result of this action, the followings happen:
• The automatic oracle reveals the label yt;
• The labeled and unlabelled datasets are up-
dated to include and exclude the recently queried data point, respectively;
• The underlying model is re-trained based on the enlarged labeled data to update φ; and
• The AL algorithm receives a reward −loss(mφ, Devl), which is the negative loss of the current trained model on the evaluation set, defined as
loss(mφ, D evl) := ∑ (x,y)∈Devl loss(mφ(x), y)
where loss(y ′, y) is the loss incurred due to predicting y ′ instead of the ground truth y .
",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"More formally, a pool-based AL problem is a Markov decision process (MDP), denoted by (S,A, Pr(st+1|st, at), R) where S is the state space, A is the set of actions, Pr(st+1|st, at) is the transition function, and R is the reward function.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
The state st ∈ S at time t consists of the labeled Dlabt and unlabelled D unl t datasets paired with the parameters of the currently trained model φt.,2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
An action at ∈,2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"A corresponds to the selection of a query datapoint, and the reward function R(st, at, st+1) := −loss(mφt , Devl).
",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
We aim to find the optimal AL policy prescribing which datapoint needs to be queried in a given state to get the most benefit.,2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"The optimal policy is found by maximising the following objective over the parameterised policies:
E(Dlab,Dunl,Devl)∼D [ Eπθ [ B∑ t=1 R(st, at, st+1) ]] (1)
where πθ is the policy network parameterised by θ,D is a distribution over possible AL problem instances, and B is the maximum number of queries made in an AL run, a.k.a. an episode.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"Following (Bachman et al., 2017), we maximise the sum of the rewards after each time step to encourage the anytime behaviour, i.e. the model should perform well after each label query.",2 Pool-based AL as a Decision Process,[0],[0]
"AL Policy
The question remains as how can we train the policy network to maximise the training objective in eqn 1.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"Typical learning approaches resort to deep reinforcement learning (RL) and provide training signal at the end of each episode to learn the optimal policy (Fang et al., 2017; Bachman
et al., 2017)",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"e.g., using policy gradient methods.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"These approaches, however, need a large number of training episodes to learn a reasonable policy as they need to deal with the credit assignment problem, i.e. discovery of the utility of individual actions in the sequence based on the achieved reward at the end of the episode.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"This exacerbates the difficulty of finding a good AL policy.
",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
We formulate learning for the AL policy as an imitation learning problem.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"At each state, we provide the AL agent with a correct action which is computed by an algorithmic expert.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
The AL agent uses the sequence of states observed in an episode paired with the expert’s sequence of actions to update its policy.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"This directly addresses the credit assignment problem, and reduces the complexity of the problem compared to the RL approaches.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"In what follows, we describe the ingredients of our deep imitation learning (IL) approach, which is summarised in Algorithm 1.
Algorithmic Expert.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"At a given AL state st, our algorithmic expert computes an action by evaluating the current pool of unlabeled data.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"More concretely, for each x′ ∈ Dpoolrnd and its correct label y ′, the underlying model mφt is re-trained to get mx ′
φt , where Dpoolrnd ⊂ D unl t is a small subset of the current large pool of unlabeled data.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"The expert action is then computed as:
arg min x′∈Dpoolrnd
loss(mx ′
φt (x), Devl).",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"(2)
In other words, our algorithmic expert tries a subset of actions to roll-out one step from the current state, in order to efficiently compute a reasonable action.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"Searching for the optimal action would be O(|Dunl|B), which is computationally challenging due to (i) the large action set, and (ii) the exponential dependence on the length of the roll out.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"We will see in the experiments that our method efficiently learns effective AL policies.
",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
Policy Network.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
Our policy network is a feedforward network with two fully-connected hidden layers.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"It receives the current AL state, and provides a preference score for a given unlabeled data point, allowing to select the most beneficial one corresponding to the highest score.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"The input to our policy network consists of three parts: (i) a fixed dimensional representation of the content and the predicted label of the unlabeled data point under consideration, (ii) a fixed-dimensional rep-
resentation of the content and the labels of the labeled dataset, and (iii) a fixed-dimensional representation of the content of the unlabeled dataset.
",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
Imitation Learning Algorithm.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
A typical approach to imitation learning (IL) is to train the policy network so that it mimics the expert’s behaviour given training data of the encountered states (input) and actions (output) performed by the expert.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
The policy network’s prediction affects future inputs during the execution of the policy.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"This violates the crucial independent and identically distributed (iid) assumption, inherent to most statistical supervised learning approaches for learning a mapping from states to actions.
",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"We make use of Dataset Aggregation (DAGGER) (Ross et al., 2011), an iterative algorithm for IL which addresses the non-iid nature of the encountered states during the AL process (see Algorithm 1).",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"In round τ of DAGGER, the learned policy network π̂τ is applied to the AL problem to collect a sequence of states which are paired with the expert actions.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"The collected pair of states and actions are aggregated to the dataset of such pairs M , collected from the previous iterations of the algorithm.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"The policy network is then re-trained on the aggregated set, resulting in π̂τ+1 for the next iteration of the algorithm.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"The intuition is to build up the set of states that the algorithm is likely to encounter during its execution, in order to increase the generalization of the policy network.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"To better leverage the training signal from the algorithmic expert, we allow the algorithm to collect state-action pairs according to a modified policy which is a mixture of π̂τ and the expert policy π̃∗τ , i.e.
πτ = βτ π̃ ∗ +",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"(1− βτ )π̂τ
where βτ ∈",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"[0, 1] is a mixing coefficient.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"This amounts to tossing a coin with parameter βτ in
each iteration of the algorithm to decide one of these two policies for data collection.
",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
Re-training the Policy Network.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"To train our policy network, we turn the preference scores to probabilities, and optimise the parameters such that the probability of the action prescribed by the expert is maximized.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"More specifically, let M := {(si, ai)}Ii=1 be the collected states paired with their expert’s prescribed actions.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"LetDpooli be the set of unlabelled datapoints in the pool within the state, and ai denote the datapoint selected by the expert in the set.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"Our training objective is∑I
i=1",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"logPr(ai|D pool i ) where
Pr(ai|Dpooli ) := exp π̂(ai;si)∑
x∈Dpooli exp π̂(x;si)
.
",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
The above can be interpreted as the probability of ai being the best action among all possible actions in the state.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"Following (Mnih et al., 2015), we randomly sample multiple1 mini-batches from the replay memoryM, in addition to the current round’s stat-action pair, in order to retrain the policy network.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"For each mini-batch, we make one SGD step to update the policy, where the gradients of the network parameters are calculated using the backpropagation algorithm.
",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
Transferring the Policy.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
We now apply the policy learned on the source task to AL in the target task.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
We expect the learned policy to be effective for target tasks which are related to the source task in terms of the data distribution and characteristics.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
Algorithm 2 illustrates the policy transfer.,3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
"The pool-based AL scenario in Algorithm 2 is cold-start; however, extending to incorporate initially available labeled data is straightforward.",3 Deep Imitation Learning to Train the,[0],[0]
We conduct experiments on text classification and named entity recognition (NER).,4 Experiments,[0],[0]

"The Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) [8] is a general model for sequential decision making in stochastic and partially observable environments, which are ubiquitous in real-world problems.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A key shortcoming of POMDP methods is the assumption that the dynamics of the environment are known a priori.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In real-world applications, however, it may be impossible to obtain a complete and accurate description of the system.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead, we may have uncertain prior knowledge about the model.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The BA-POMDP framework provides a Bayesian approach to decision making by maintaining a probability distribution over possible models as the agent acts in an online reinforcement learning setting [5, 19].",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This method casts the Bayesian reinforcement learning problem into a POMDP planning problem where the hidden model of the environment is part of the state space.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, this planning problem becomes very large, with a countably infinite state space over all possible models, and as such, current solution methods are not scalable or perform poorly [13].

Online and sample-based planning has shown promising performance on non-trivial POMDP problems [12].,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Online methods reduce the complexity by considering the relevant (i.e., reachable) states only, and sample-based approaches tackle the complexity issues through approximations in the form of simulated interactions with the environment.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here we modify one of those methods, Partial Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP)",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"[15] and extend it to the Bayes-Adaptive case, leading to a novel approach: BA-POMCP.

"In particular, we improve the sampling approach by exploiting the structure of the BA-POMDP resulting in root sampling and expected models methods.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We also present an approach for more efficient model representation, which we call linking states.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we prove the correctness of our improvements, showing that they converge to the true BA-POMDP solution.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"The goal of the agent in a POMDP is to maximize the expected cumulative (discounted) reward, also called the expected return.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]

",at−1,zt〉 up to the current step t. It can use this history to maintain a probability distribution over the state, also called a belief, b(s).",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"A solution to a POMDP is then a mapping from a belief b to an action a, which is called a policy π.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"Solution methods aim to find an optimal policy, a mapping from a belief to an action with the highest possible expected return.
",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
The agent maintains its belief during execution through belief updates.,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"A belief update calculates the posterior probability of the state s′ given the previous belief over s and action-observation pair 〈a,z〉: b′(s) = P (s′|b(s), a, z).",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
This operation is infeasible for large spaces because it enumerates over the entire state space.,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
A common approximation method is to represent the belief with a (unweighted) particle filter [17].,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
A particle filter is a collection of K particles (states).,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"Each particle represents a probability of 1K ; if a specific state x occurs n times in a particle filter, then P (x) = nK .",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"The precision of the filter is determined by the number of particles K. To update such a belief after execution of action a and observation z, a standard approach is to utilize rejection sampling: the agent repeatedly samples a state s from its belief, then simulates the execution of a on s through D, and receives a (simulated) new state s′sim and observation zsim.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"s
′ is added to the new belief only when zsim equals z, and rejected otherwise.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"This process repeats until the new belief contains K particles.

Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP),2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"[15], is a scalable method which extends Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to solve POMDPs.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
POMCP is one of the leading algorithms for solving general POMDPs.,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"At each time step, the algorithm performs online planning by incrementally building a lookahead tree that contains Q(h,a), where h is the action-observation history-path to reach that node.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
It samples hidden states s at the root node (called ‘root sampling’) and uses that state to sample a trajectory that first traverses the lookahead tree and then performs a (random) rollout.,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
The return of this trajectory is used to update the statistics for all visited nodes.,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"These statistics include the number of times an action has been taken at a history (N(h,a)) and estimated value of being in that node (Q(h,a)), based on an average over the returns.
",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"Because this lookahead tree can be very large, the search is directed to the relevant parts by selecting the actions inside the tree that maximize the ‘upper confidence bounds’",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"[2]: U(h,a) = Q(h, a) + c √ log(N(h) + 1)/N(h,a).",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"Here, N(h) is the number of times the history has been visited.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"At the end of each simulation, the discounted accumulated return is used to update the estimated value of all the nodes in the tree that have been visited during that simulation.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"POMCP terminates after some criteria has been met, typically defined by a maximum number of simulations or allocated time.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"The agent then picks the action with the highest estimated value (maxaQ(b,a)).",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
POMCP can be shown to converge to an -optimal value function.,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"Moreover, the method has demonstrated good performance in large domains with a limited number of simulations.",2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
The extension of POMCP that is used in this work is discussed in Section 3.,2.1 POMDPs,[0],[0]
"Most research concerning POMDPs has considered the task of planning: given a full specification of the model, determine an optimal policy (e.g., [8, 14]).",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
"However, in many real-world applications, the model is not (perfectly) known in advance, which means that the agent has to learn about its environment during execution.",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
This is the task considered in reinforcement learning (RL),2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
"[16].
",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
"A fundamental RL problem is the difficulty of deciding whether to select actions in order to learn a better model of the environment, or to exploit the current knowledge about the rewards and effects of actions.",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
"In recent years, Bayesian RL methods have become popular because they can provide a principled solution to this exploration/exploitation tradeoff",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]

",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
"In particular, we consider the framework of Bayes-Adaptive POMDPs [11, 13].",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
BA-POMDPs use Dirichlet distributions to model uncertainty over transitions and observations2 (typically assuming the reward function is chosen by the designer and is known).,2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
"In particular, if the agent could observe both states and observations, it could maintain a vector χ with the counts of the occurrences for all 〈s, a, s′, z〉 tuples.",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]
"We write χs′zsa for the number of times that 〈s,a〉 is followed by 〈s′,z〉.

"While the agent cannot observe the states and has uncertainty about the actual count vector, this uncertainty can be represented using regular POMDP formalisms.",2.2 BA-POMDPs,[0],[0]

"The most straightforward one, BA-POMCP-STEP is employed in what we refer to as ‘BA-POMCP’.",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"This method, shown in Algorithm 3, is similar to BA-MCP [7]: essentially, it samples a dynamic model Dsa which specifies probabilities Pr(s′,z|s,a) and subsequently samples an actual next state and observation from that distribution.",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"Note that the underlying states and observations are all represented simply as an index, and hence the assignment on line 5 is not problematic.",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"However, the cost of the model sampling operation in line 1 is.
",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"Root Sampling of the Model BA-MCP [7] addresses the fully observable BRL problem by using POMCP on an augmented state s̄ = 〈s, T 〉, consisting of the observable state, as well as the hidden true transition function T .",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"Application of POMCP’s root sampling of state in this case leads to ‘root sampling of a transition function’: Since the true transition model T does not change during the simulation, one is sampled at the root and used during the entire simulation.",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"In the BA-POMCP case, root sampling of a state s̄ = 〈s, χ〉 does not lead to a same interpretation: no model, but counts are root sampled and they do change over time.
",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"We use this as inspiration to introduce a similar, but clearly different, (since this is not root sampling of state) technique called root sampling of the model (which we will refer to as just ‘root sampling’).",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"The idea is simple: every time we root sample a state s̄ = 〈s, χ〉 ∼ b̄ at the beginning of a simulation (line 5 in Algorithm 1), we directly sample a Ḋ ∼ Dir(χ), which we will refer to as the root-sampled model Ḋ and it is used for the rest of the simulation.
",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
We denote this root sampling in BA-POMCP as ‘R-BA-POMCP’.,3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
The approach is formalized by R-BA-POMCPSTEP (Algorithm 4).,3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
Note that no count updates take place (cf. line 4 in Algorithm 3).,3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"This highlights an important advantage of this technique: since the counts are not used in the remainder of the simulation, the copy of counts (as part of line 6 of Algorithm 1) can be avoided altogether.",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]
"Since this copy operation is costly, especially in larger domains, where the number of states, action and observations and the number of counts is large, this can lead to significant savings.",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]

"The consequence is that the linking state copy-operation can safely perform a shallow copy of the counts χ, and must only consider δ, which is assumed to be much smaller.

Linking states can be used during the (rejection-sample-based) belief update at the beginning of each real time step.,3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]

"Theoretically, the number of updated counts represented in δ increases and the size of δ may (eventually) grow similar to the size of χ.",3 BA-POMDPs via Sample-based Planning,[0],[0]

"It is known (Livni et al., 2014), that due to hardness of learning intersection of halfspaces (Klivans & Sherstov, 2006; Daniely et al., 2014), 1–hidden layer neural networks are computationally hard for a wide class of activation functions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, as the last example illustrates, the choice of µ is indeed crucial for performance.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For a fixed prior µ, the class of ILN functions is highly expressive, since f can be chosen to approximate any 1- hidden layer architecture to arbitrary precision (by setting f to delta functions around the weights of the network, as

"As argued in Heinemann et al. (2016), ILN will generalize well when there is a large probability mass of w parameters that attain a small loss.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The key observation that makes certain ILN tractable to learn is that Eq. 1 is a linear functional in f .,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
In that sense it is a linear classifier and enjoys the rich theory and algorithmic toolbox for such classifiers.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In particular, one can use the fact that linear classifiers can be learned via the kernel trick in a batch (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995) as well as online settings (Kivinen et al., 2004).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In other words, we can reduce learning ILN to the problem of computing the kernel function between two examples.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically the problem reduces to computing integrals of the following form:
k(x1,x2) = ∫ ψ(x1;w) · ψ(x2;w)dµ(w) (2)
= E w̄∼µ",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

In this work we extend this result to the case where no closed form kernel is available, and thus the kernel trick is not directly applicable.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We thus turn our attention to the setting where features (i.e., w vectors) can be randomly sampled.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this setting, our main result shows that for the squared loss, we can efficiently learn the above class.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we can surprisingly do this with a computational cost comparable to that of methods that have access to the closed form kernel k(x1,x2).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The observation we begin with is that sampling random features (i.e., w above), leads to an unbiased estimate of the kernel in Eq. 2.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, if for example, we ignore complexity issues and can sample infinitely many w’s, it is not surprising that we can avoid the need for exact computation of the kernel.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, our results provide a much stronger and practical result.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given T training samples, the lower bound on achievable accuracy is O(1/ √ T ) (see Shamir, 2015).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that we can in fact achieve this rate, using Õ(T 2) calls2 to the random feature generator.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For comparison, note that O(T 2) is the size of the kernel matrix, and is thus likely to be the cost of any algorithm that uses an explicit kernel matrix, where one is available.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

From a different perspective the relation between random features and kernels has been noted by Rahimi & Recht (2007) who show how to represent translation invariant kernels in terms of random features.,4. Related Work,[0],[0]
"This idea has been further studied (Bach, 2015; Kar & Karnick, 2012) for other kernels as well.",4. Related Work,[0],[0]

",4. Related Work,[0],[0]
"To relate the above results to ours, we begin by emphasizing that the bound in (Dai et al., 2014) holds for fixed γ, and refers to optimization of the regularized objective.",4. Related Work,[0],[0]

"Note however, that the number of estimated features (as a function of B) is worse in our case.

Our approach to the problem is to consider learning with a noisy estimate of the kernel.,4. Related Work,[0],[0]
"A related setting was studied in Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2011b), where the authors considered learning with kernels when the data is corrupted.",4. Related Work,[0],[0]
Noise in the data and noise in the scalar product estimation are not equivalent when there is non-linearity in the kernel space embedding.,4. Related Work,[0],[0]

"The objective of the algorithm is to minimize the regret against a benchmark of B-bounded functions, as in Eq. 7.
",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
A classic approach to the problem is to exploit the OGD algorithm.,5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Its simplest version would be to update ft+1 → ft − η∇t where η is a step size, and ∇t is the gradient of the loss w.r.t.",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
f at ft.,5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"In our case,∇t is given by:
∇t = (〈ft,Φ(xt)〉 − yt) Φ(xt) (9)
",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
Applying this update would also result in a function ft =∑t i=1 αiΦ(xt) as we have in Algorithm 1 (but with different αi from ours).,5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"However, in our setting this update is not applicable since the scalar product 〈ft,Φ(xt)〉 is not available.",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
One alternative is to use a stochastic unbiased estimate of the gradient that we denote by ∇̄t.,5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
This induces an update step ft+1 → ft − η∇̄t.,5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"One can show that OGD with such an estimated gradient enjoys the following upper bound on the regret E [ ∑ `t(ft)− `t(f∗)] for every ‖f∗‖ ≤ B (e.g., see Shalev-Shwartz, 2011):

"The corresponding unbiased gradient estimate is:

The variance of ∇̄ affects the convergence rate and depends on both ‖α‖1 and the number of estimationsm.,5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"We wish to maintain m = O(T ) estimations per round, while achieving O( √ T ) regret.
",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"To effectively regularize ‖α‖1, we modify the OGD algorithm so that whenever Et is larger then 16B, we do not perform the usual update.",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Instead, we perform a shrinking step that divides α(t) (and hence ft) by 4.",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Treating B as constant, this guarantees that ‖α‖1 = O(ηT ), and in turn Var(∇̄t) = O(η 2T 2 m ).",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Setting η = O(1/ √ T ), we have that m = O(T ) estimations are sufficient.
",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]
"The rationale for the shrinkage is that wheneverEt is large, it indicates that ft is “far away” from the B-ball, and a shrinkage step, similar to projection, brings ft closer to the optimal element in the B-ball.",5. Algorithm,[0],[0]

In this section we provide a toy experiment to compare our Shrinking Gradient algorithm to other random feature based methods.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In particular, we consider the following three algorithms: Fixed-Random: Sample a set of r features w1, . . .",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
",wr and evaluate these on all the train and test points.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Namely, all x points will be evaluated on the same features.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is the standard random features approach proposed in Rahimi & Recht (2007; 2009).,6. Experiments,[0],[0]

These features will from that point on be used for evaluating dot products with x.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Thus, different x points will use different features.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
Shrinking Gradient:,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is the approach proposed here in Section 3.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Namely, each training point x samples m features in order to calculate the dot product with the current regression function.
",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In comparing the algorithms we choose r, k,m so that the same overall number of features is calculated.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For all methods we explored different initial step sizes and schedules for changing the step size.
",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
The key question in comparing the three algorithms is how well they use a given budget of random features.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
To explore this we perform an experiments to simulate the high dimensional feature case.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We consider vectors x ∈ RD, where a random feature w corresponds to a uniform choice of coordinate w in x.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We work in the regime where D is large in the sense that D > T , where T is the size of the training data.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
Thus random sampling of T features will not reveal all coordinates of x.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
The training set is generated as follows.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"First, a training set x1, . . .",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
",xT ∈",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"RD is
sampled from a standard Gaussian.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We furthermore clip negative values to zero, in order to make the data sparser and more challenging for feature sampling.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
Next a weight vector a ∈,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
RD is chosen as a random sparse linear combination of the training points.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is done in order for the true function to be in the corresponding RKHS.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, the training set is labeled using yi = a · xi.
",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
During training we do not assume that the algorithms have access to x.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Rather they can uniformly sample coordinates from it, which mimics our setting of random features.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the experiment we take D = 550, 600, . . .",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
", 800 and T = 200.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
"All algorithms perform one pass over the data, to emulate the online regret setting.",6. Experiments,[0],[0]
The results shown in Figure 1 show that our method indeed achieves a lower loss while working with the same feature budget.,6. Experiments,[0],[0]
We presented a new online algorithm that employs kernels implicitly but avoids the kernel trick assumption.,7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Namely, the algorithm can be invoked even when one has access to only estimations of the scalar product.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"The problem was motivated by kernels resulting from neural nets, but it can of course be applied to any scalar product of the form we described.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"As an example of an interesting extension, consider a setting where a learner can observe an unbiased estimate of a coordinate in a kernel matrix, or alternatively the scalar product between any two observations.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Our results imply that in this setting the above rates are applicable, and at least for the square loss, having no access to the true values in the kernel matrix is not necessarily prohibitive during training.
",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"The results show that with sample size T we can achieve error of O( B√
T ).",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"As demonstrated in Shamir (2015) these
rates are optimal, even when the scalar product is computable.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
To achieve this rate our algorithm needs to perform Õ(B4T 2) scalar product estimations.,7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"When the scalar product can be computed, existing kernelized algorithms need to observe a fixed proportion of the kernel matrix, hence they observe order of Ω(T 2) scalar products.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"In Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2015) it was shown that when the scalar product can be computed exactly, one would need access to at least Ω(T ) entries to the kernel matrix.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
It is still an open problem whether one has to access Ω(T 2) entries when the kernel can be computed exactly.,7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, as we show here, for fixed B even if the kernel can only be estimated Õ(T 2) estimations are enough.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"It would be interesting to further investigate and improve the performance of our algorithm in terms of the norm bound B.
To summarize, we have shown that the kernel trick is not strictly necessary in terms of sample complexity.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Instead, simply sampling random features via our proposed algorithm results in a similar sample complexity.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Recent empirical results by Zhang et al. (2016) show that using a large number of random features and regression comes close to the performance of the first successful multilayer CNNs (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) on CIFAR-10.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Although deep learning architectures still substantially outperform random features, it is conceivable that with the right choice of random features, and scalable learning algorithms like we present here, considerable improvement in performance is possible.",7. Discussion,[0],[0]

Infinite Layer Networks (ILN) have been proposed as an architecture that mimics neural networks while enjoying some of the advantages of kernel methods.,abstractText,[0],[0]
ILN are networks that integrate over infinitely many nodes within a single hidden layer.,abstractText,[0],[0]

"In this work we give an online algorithm for ILN, which avoids the kernel trick assumption.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"More generally and of independent interest, we show that kernel methods in general can be exploited even when the kernel cannot be efficiently computed but can only be estimated via sampling.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We provide a regret analysis for our algorithm, showing that it matches the sample complexity of methods which have access to kernel values.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Thus, our method is the first to demonstrate that the kernel trick is not necessary, as such, and random features suffice to obtain comparable performance.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"The distributed nature of these efforts results in a set of annotated resources that are similar in spirit, but not strictly compatible.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A major axis of structural divergence in semantic formalisms is whether based on spans (Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005) or dependencies (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Oepen et al., 2014; Banarescu et al., 2013; Copestake et al., 2005, inter alia).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Learning from a union of these resources seems promising, since more data almost always translates into better performance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is indeed the case for two prior techniques—parameter sharing

"Parameter sharing can be used in a wide range of multitask scenarios, when there is no data overlap or even any similarity between the tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Søgaard and Goldberg, 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But techniques involving joint decoding have so far only been shown to work for parallel annotations of dependency-based formalisms, which are structurally very similar to each other (Lluı́s et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Of particular interest is the approach of Peng et al., where three kinds of semantic graphs are jointly learned on the same input, using parallel annotations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, as new annotation efforts cannot be expected to use the same original texts as earlier efforts, the utility of this approach is limited.

The meaning of natural language should always be accompanied by a context.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Grounded language acquisition aims at learning the meaning of language in the context of an observed world state.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A solution framework typically addresses the following subproblems: segmenting the text into meaningful phrasal units, determining which world state information is being referred to, and finding proper alignments from these units to the events of values in the world state.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The task has attracted much attention from the NLP community with a special focus on aligning text descriptions onto processed, structured event records (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Liang et al., 2009; Hajishirzi et al., 2011).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Various statistical models have been proposed, attempting at

characterizing the interaction between text spans and categorical values (e.g., direction=‘East’) or strings (e.g., person names).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The previously addressed term semantic correspondences narrowly describes the process of aligning natural language spans to different data fields.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, there still exists a gap between alignment results and the underlying semantics.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"People tend to use various phrases to describe information that are inferred from different amounts of numerical values in a data field, or values derived from additional operations over fields.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Consider the example description for a basketball game shown in Figure 1.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The phrase edged out in the first sentence implies the fact that the Toronto Raptors had beaten their opponent by a relatively narrow margin.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This could only be derived from an operation of subtraction between two scores that correspond to the field PTS for both teams in the event table, which leads to a relatively small difference of only four points.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Previous efforts on learning semantic correspondences relying on categorical distributions (Liang et al., 2009) or string pattern features (Hajishirzi et al., 2012; Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2014) do not have the capability to accurately capture numerical information, especially for the part that does not appear explicitly in the table and needs to be inferred.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Such kind of language grounding is important both for natural language understanding and for natural language generation.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For language understanding, establishing explicit connections between symbols and values beyond ungrounded symbolic meaning representations will be useful for acquisition and inference of numerical commonsense (Narisawa et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For language generation, properly aligned information is the key to acquiring patterns of various lexical choices under different world states (Roy and Reiter, 2005).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we make a step towards more explicit semantic correspondences between structured data and texts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Rather than only producing coarse alignments between data fields and text spans, we try to detect the latent semantics underlying these alignments by prompting explicit semantic annotations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We make the first attempt at utilizing publicly available datasets originally prepared for data-to-text language generation to produce such annotations for words and phrases in natural language without additional supervision.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we conduct our study on a recently released dataset of descriptions for NBA basketball games with structured tables of game records.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Different from a few popular datasets that have been well conjectured to be produced from rules (Reiter, 2017), the summaries are all written by humans.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The text contains some numbers and proper nouns, which are easier to establish correspondence with data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the majority of texts contain many informative words, some of which need to be inferred indirectly from various types of values in the data cells.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We want to establish explicit correspondences for them.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We derive a set of semantic labels from original data fields (Sec 4.1).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These labels could be executed to establish direct correspondences to one or more values in the structured table.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
No annotation on the original dataset means unsupervised learning from weak distant supervision should be conducted.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We design a semi-hidden Markov model to address this problem (Sec 4.2), which could align a semantic label to a word span.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the model, we leverage continuous probability distributions to model the correspondences between numerical values and lexical terms, which has not been well captured in previous work.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To address the emerged issue of “garbage collection” that commonly appears in statistical alignment models (Sec 4.5), we add a soft statistical con-
straint via posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a by-product, we also show how the derived semantic annotations could be used to induce descriptive templates for data-to-text generation (Sec 5).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Experimental results (Sec 6) suggest the feasibility of the setting in this study, and show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Grounded language acquisition has aroused wide interest in various disciplines (Siskind, 1996; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Gorniak and Roy, 2007; Yu and Siskind, 2013; Chrupała et al., 2015).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Later work in the community of natural language processing also moved in this direction by relaxing the amount of supervision to enable a model to learn from ambiguous alignments (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Chen and Mooney, 2008).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Some research aimed at establishing coarse alignments between simulated robot soccer game records and commentary sentences (Chen and Mooney, 2008; Chen et al., 2010; Bordes et al., 2010; Hajishirzi et al., 2011).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"For weather forecast domain, Liang et al. (2009) used a hierarchical hidden Markov model in order to map utterances to world states, which coped with segmentation and alignment together.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"More recently, Koncel-Kedziorski et al. (2014) tried to obtain the correspondences between real commentaries and structured football (soccer) events in multiple resolutions.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
We are distinct from this line of work in the fact that we aim at producing explicit semantic annotations that could capture information from structured tables.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"To achieve this goal, we need additional scaling or operations to enable data fields and values to be faithfully mapped onto texts.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
This will address the issue of the lack of consideration for the relationship between lexical terms and numerical values.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our approach makes a significant difference in that our framework could generalize to numerical values or value combinations that are unseen in training, and will not be simply reciting cooccurrence patterns of exact values in the training data.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Our work relates to learning executable semantic parsers under weak supervision.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Early semantic parsing started from fully supervised training with annotated meaning representations available (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2006; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), but more recent work focused on reducing the amount of supervision required (Artzi and Zettlemoyer,
2013).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"The intuition behind weakly supervised executable semantic parsing is that once the latent semantic representation has been executed, one could test whether the execution results could match the information with available weak supervision signals such as answers to natural language queries (Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011), or task completion from instructional navigations (Misra et al., 2017).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Such formulations have been adapted for question answering over structured tables (Pasupat and Liang, 2015; Krishnamurthy et al., 2017).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"However, the current research focus is to convert a natural language question into executable table queries and to directly retrieve results.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
They do not have the need of inference involving numerical commonsense implied by various lexical patterns.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"A few unsupervised approaches exist (Poon and Domingos, 2009; Poon, 2013) but only specific to translating language into queries in the highly structured database and cannot be applied to our domain.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our approach is implemented as assigning tag annotations over text spans, which is conceptually related to fine-grained named entity tagging (Ling and Weld, 2012).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Our setting only requires a rather weak and distant form of supervision from paired tables and texts without annotations for fine-grained alignments between phrases and data cells.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Similar modeling and learning strategies could potentially be useful for considerably large tag space derived from structured knowledge bases in the future (Choi et al., 2018).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"The feasibility of this work is partly due to the availability of data, mostly comes from the field of data-to-text language generation.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Related work in data-to-text generation mainly focused on directly generating summary descriptions for structured data (Mei et al., 2016; Kiddon et al., 2016; Murakami et al., 2017; Wiseman et al., 2017), without establishing underlying semantic correspondences.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Texts generated thereby can be fluent but not conforming to the input data, unlike templatebased approaches where lexical choices could be directly controlled.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In our work, we find the derived semantic correspondences between data and texts to be useful for template induction, either with simple heuristics to automatically extract description patterns (how to say) and corresponding triggers (what & when to say), or with more crafted discriminative learning approaches (cf.",2 Related work,[0],[0]

The key part is to characterize different types of correspondences (Sec 4.2).,3 Technical overview,[0],[0]
"We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to perform maximum likelihood estimation, and introduce a soft statistical regularization to guide the model towards a better solution (Sec 4.5).",3 Technical overview,[0],[0]

"To utilize the game dates, we converted them from calendar date to the day of week, e.g. 11/28/2016 is converted to Monday as a categorical value.",6.1 Experimental setup,[0],[0]
"Due to the huge noise in the ROTOWIRE dataset, containing many sentences irrelevant with their corresponding tables, we filtered out the sentences that contain no team or player names, or those that mention more than 2 players, as most of them are irrelevant texts.
",6.1 Experimental setup,[0],[0]
"Following Liang et al. (2009), we also used the parameters of a simpler model without Markov dependency (which was uniformly initialized) to initialize our complete model with obtained parameters, and then trained it until convergence.",6.1 Experimental setup,[0],[0]
"We adapted Liang et al. (2009)’s framework to the table schema in the ROTOWIRE dataset, and ran experiments accordingly as our baseline model.",6.1 Experimental setup,[0],[0]
"It is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of tag assignments for the entire dataset, since the tags are not annotated in the original data.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"We recruited three human annotators with familiarity in the domain of basketball games to label 300 sentences (around 8,000 tokens in total, and 30% of them are annotated with tags) from the test set.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"There exists a fraction (18%) where agreements were not made, we included all the proposed tags from the annotators to be correct.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"Also, because of the ambiguity of annotations, we use the base names of derived tags (e.g. Rebounds Delta) for numerics-to-string relationship evaluation.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
(e.g. Rebounds Delta is reduced to Rebounds),6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"Finally, we calculated the precision and recall for non-NULL tag assignments at word-level.
",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
The results are shown in Table 2.,6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"The Liang et al. (2009) framework could still achieve around 65% recall, because there exist a large proportion of correspondences that could be easily captured by exact matches and simple categorical distributions.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"Our model without PR achieves lower precision than the baseline, because the baseline did not model numerics-to-string relationships and encountered less severe issues of garbage collection.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"We can observe that our initial model indeed outperforms the baseline system in recall, while PR helps a lot to avoid distraction from irrelevant information that should be tagged as NULL.
",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also include more fine-grained results for different types of correspondences, shown in Table 3.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"As expected, numerics-to-string correspon-
dences are the most difficult part in this study.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"Another notable thing is that although we found that around 40% of numerics-to-numerics correspondences were ambiguous due to the appearance of identical values from different table cells, our model could still achieve a high accuracy of 95.0%.",6.2.1 Intrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also tested how the derived templates could perform in language generation, when compared with the baseline using the same heuristics described in Sec 5.",6.2.2 Extrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]

"These automatic metrics were designed for various aspects in NLG and may not all suit our main focus well, so we also conducted human evaluation on information correctness (1-5 scale ratings, the higher the better).",6.2.2 Extrinsic evaluation,[0],[0]

Figure 4 shows some examples produced from our methods.,6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Some of the alignments are meaningful, for example, the model assigned the word perfect with the annotation FT Percent, which represents the percentage of free throws.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Without PR, our model performed poorly by aligning many common words to those rarely mentioned cells.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"In this example, the FT Made and FT Attempt fields in the input table both have the same value 8, making it difficult for a model without proper local coherence modeling to distinguish between them.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Because our initial model without PR cannot annotate NULL correctly, the Markov transition between these two numbers was intercepted by three meaningless tokens.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"However, after injecting the PR constraint, most of the unmentioned words were successfully identified.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"The model captured the pattern that FT Attempt almost always follows FT Made, making it correctly assigned these two labels.
",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"We conducted ablation experiments for some
of the components (Table 5).",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"When setting the maximum phrase length to be k = 1, the model degenerates to a normal HMM.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
The performance measured by F1-score drops for only a little.,6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"One possible reason is that Semi-HMMs tend to output some meaningless combinations of words as phrases, such as the phrase points on in Figure 4 (b), which could lead to many redundant annotations that hampers precision albeit its help to recall.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"We also tried to disable the transition probabilities during both training and inference, which led to lower precision and lower recall naturally as there was no modeling for local coherence.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Finally, by canceling the NULL-skipping mechanism, we found that the numerics-to-numerics annotation accuracy dropped from 95.0% to 88.8%.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Many of the spurious numerics-to-numerics annotations, such as the 8 - of - 8 in Figure 4 (d), could be corrected using transition probabilities under the skipping-NULL mechanism (Figure 4 (c)).
",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
One additional advantage of our model is that we can easily verify what the model has captured.,6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"For the latent annotation Team Points Delta, we sort its corresponding phrases by weights P (c|l)P (c) and we list the top 12 weighted words in Figure 5.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
We can observe that most of the displayed phrases have strong semantic relationship with score differences.,6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"More interestingly, we found the mean and variance values estimated by the Gaussian distributions rather informative.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"When l = Teams Points Delta, we observed that µl,narrowly ≈ 2 while µl,blow out ≈ 26.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]
"We could infer the conditions under which some phrases should be used, providing useful insights for lexical choices in language generation.",6.3 Analysis,[0],[0]

This is a preliminary study for using weak supervision from structured data and texts to address the challenging problem of language grounding.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"For future study, one could collect large-scale data and texts in other domains where more complex grounding on phrases such as “increasing trends” should be done.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"To enhance modeling power, unsupervised discriminative models that utilize rich features (Berg-kirkpatrick et al., 2010) could also be explored.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]

Xie (2015) develop an anglebased regularizer to encourage the weight vectors of hidden units in restricted Boltzmann machine to be close to orthogonal.,2. Related Works,[0],[0]
"The non-obtuse angle between each pair of weight
vectors is measured and the regularizer is defined as the mean of these angles minus their variance.",2. Related Works,[0],[0]
A larger mean encourages the vectors to have larger angles overall and a smaller variance encourages the vectors to be evenly different from each other.,2. Related Works,[0],[0]
Xie (2015) apply this regularizer to encourage the projection vectors in distance metric learning to be diverse and show that promoting diversity can reduce model size without sacrificing modeling power.,2. Related Works,[0],[0]

"Across social media, thousands of posts daily take the form of informal FIRST-PERSON NARRATIVES.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These narratives provide a rich resource for computational modeling of how people feel about the events they report on.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Being able to reliably predict the affect a person may feel towards events they encounter has a range of potential applications, including monitoring mood and mental health (Isaacs et al., 2013) and getting conversational assistants to respond appropriately (Bowden et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, as these narratives are told from the perspective of a protagonist, this research could be used to understand other types of protagonist-framed narratives, like those in fiction.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We are interested in the opinions that a protagonist has, not the author per se.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This is sometimes referred to as internal sentiment or self reflective sentiment.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While in many situations that is overlaid with the author’s opinions, in first-personal narratives, because the author is the protagonist, the two perspectives align.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here, we use the term affect to reference this protagonist-centered notion of opinion.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A central obstacle to reliable affect prediction is that that people tend not to explicitly flag their affective state, by saying I am happy.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Large-scale sentiment dictionaries focus on compiling lexical items that bear a consistent affect all on their own (Wilson et al., 2005).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But people tend to describe situations, such as My friend bought me flowers, or I got a parking ticket, from which other humans can readily infer their implicit affective reactions.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One approach to this problem aims to directly learn units larger than a lexical item that reliably bear some marker of polarity or emotion (Vu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Ding and Riloff, 2016; Goyal et al., 2010; Russo et al., 2015; Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Reckman et al., 2013).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Another approach aims to model the speaker’s affect to an event compositionally, e.g. Anand and Reschke (2010) (A&R) proposed that the affect a lexical predicate communicates should be modeled as an n-ary function, taking as inputs the affect that the speaker bears towards each partici-

pant.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Table 1 contains A&R’s functions for verbs of possession: a state in which X has Y or X lacks Y does not convey a clear affect unless we know what the speaker thinks of both X and Y .,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"If the speaker has positive affect toward both X and Y (Row 1), then we infer that her attitude toward the event is positive, but if either is negative, then we infer that the speaker is negative toward the event.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Rashkin et al. (2016) represent the typical affect communicated by particular predicates via connotation frames.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here we are finding the internal sentiment of the speaker, or, as Rashkin et al. refer to it, the ”mental state” of the speaker.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Inspired by A&R’s framework, our work learns lexico-functional patterns (patterns involving lexical items or pairs of lexical items in specific grammatical relations that we show to capture functorargument relations in A&R’s sense), about the effects of combining particular arguments with particular verbs (event types) from first-person narratives.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our novel observation is that learning these compositional functions is greatly simplified in the case of first-person affect.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"People bear positive affect to themselves, so sentences with first-person elements, e.g. I/we/me, reduce the problem for an approach like A&R’s to learning the polarity that results from composing the verb with only one of its arguments, i.e. only Rows 1, 2 in Table 1 need to be learned for first person subjects.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Firstperson narratives are full of such sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
See Table 2.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that the learned patterns are often consonant with A&R’s predictions, but are richer, including e.g. many private state descriptions (Wiebe et al., 2004; Wiebe, 1990).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition, we demonstrate that these lexicofunctional patterns improve the performance of several off-the-shelf sentiment analyzers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that Stanford sentiment (Socher et al., 2013) has a best performance of 0.67 macro F on our test set.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We then supplement it with our learned patterns and demonstrate significant improvements.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our final ensemble achieves 0.75 F on the test set.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We discuss related work in more detail in Sec. 5.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We start with a set of first-person narratives (weblogs) drawn from the Spinn3r corpus, that cover a wide range of topics (Burton et al., 2009; Gordon and Swanson, 2009).",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"To reduce noise, we restrict the blogs to those from well-known blogging sites (Ding and Riloff, 2016), and select 15,466 stories whose length ranges from 225 to 375 words.
",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"We hand-annotate a set of 477 positive and 440 negative stories, and use these to bootstrap a larger set of 1,420 negative and 2,288 positive stories.",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"To bootstrap, we apply AutoSlog-TS, a weakly supervised pattern learner that only requires training sets os stories labeled broadly as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE (Riloff, 1996; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
AutoSlog uses a set of syntactic templates to define different types of linguistic expressions.,2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"The left-hand side of Table 3 lists examples of AutoSlog patterns and the right-hand side illustrates a specific lexical-syntactic pattern that corresponds to each general pattern template, as instantiated in first-person stories.1 When bootstrapping a larger positive and negative story corpus, we use the whole story, not just the first person sentences.
",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"The left-hand-side of Table 3 shows that the learned patterns can involve syntactic arguments
1The examples are shown as general expressions for readability, but the actual patterns must match the syntactic constraints associated with the pattern template.
of the verbal predicate, which means that these patterns are proxies for one column of verbal function tables like those in Table 1.",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"However, they can also include verb-particle constructions, such as cheated on, or verb-head-of-preposition constructions.",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"In each case though, because these patterns are localized to a verb and only one element, they allow us to learn highly specific patterns that could be incorporated into a dictionary such as +- Effect (Choi and Wiebe, 2014).",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"AutoSlog simultaneously harvests both (syntactically constrained) MWE patterns and more compositionally regular verb-argument groups at the same time.
",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"AutoSlog-TS computes statistics on the strength of association of each pattern with each class, i.e. P(POSITIVE | p) and P(NEGATIVE | p), along with the pattern’s overall frequency.",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"We define three parameters for each class: θf , the frequency with which a pattern occurs, θp, the probability with which a pattern is associated with the given class and θn, the number of patterns that must occur in the text for it to be labeled.",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"These parameters are tuned on the dev set (Riloff, 1996; Oraby et al., 2015; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).
",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"To bootstrap a larger corpus, we want settings that have lower recall but very high precision.",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"We select θp = 0.7, θf = 10 and θn = 3 for the positive class and θp = 0.85, θf = 10 and θn = 4 for the negative class for bootstrapping.",2 Bootstrapping a First-Person Sentiment Corpus,[0],[0]
"Our experimental setup involves first creating a corpus of training and test sentences, then applying AutoSlog-TS a second time to learn linguistic patterns.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We then set up methods for cascading classifiers to explore whether ensemble classifiers improve our results.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Training Set: From the bootstrapped set of stories, we create a corpus of sentences.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"A critical simplifying assumption of our method is that a multi-sentence story can be labelled as a whole as positive or negative, and that each of its sentences inherit this polarity.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
This means we can learn the polarity of events in such narratives from their (noisy) inherited polarity without labelling individual sentences.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Our training set consists of 46,255 positive and 25,069 negative sentences.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Test Set: We create the test set by selecting 4k random first-person sentences.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"First-person sentences either contain an explicit first person marker, i.e. we and my or start with either a progressive verb or pleonastic it.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"To collect gold labels, we designed a qualifier and a HIT for Mechanical Turk, and put
these out for annotation by 5 Turkers, who label each instance as positive, negative, or neutral.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"To ensure the high quality of the test set, we select sentences that were labelled consistently positive or negative by 4 or 5 Turkers.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We collected 1,266 positive and 1,440 negative sentences.
",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Dev Set: We created the dev set using the same method as the test set, having Turkers annotate 2k random first-person sentences.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We collected 498 positive and 754 negative sentences.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]

AutoSlog First-Person Sentence Classifier.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"In order to learn new affect functions, we develop a second sentence-level classifier using AutoSlogTS.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We run AutoSlog over the training corpus, using the dev set to tune the parameters θf , θp and θn (?), in order to maximize macro F-score.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Our best parameters on the dev set for positive is θf=18, θp=0.85 and θn=1 and for negative is θf=1, θp=0.5 and θn=1.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We specify that if the sentence is in both classes we rename it as neutral.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We will refer to this classifier as the AutoSlog classifier.
",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Baseline First-Person Sentence Classifiers.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Our goal is to see whether the knowledge we learn using AutoSlog-TS complements existing sentiment classifiers.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We thus experiment with a number of baseline classifiers: the default SVM classifier from Weka with unigram features (Hall et al., 2005), a version of the NRC-Canada sentiment classifier (Mohammad et al., 2013), provided to us by Qadir and Riloff (2014), and the Stanford Sentiment classifier (Socher et al., 2013).
",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Retrained Stanford.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The Stanford Sentiment classifier is a based on Recursive Neural Networks, and trained on a compositional Sentiment Treebank, which includes fine-grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases from 11,855 sentences from movie reviews.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
It can accurately predict some compositional semantic effects and handle negation.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"However since it was trained on movie reviews, it is likely to be missing labelled data for some common phrases in our blogs.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Thus we also retrained it (RETRAINED STANFORD) on high precision phrases from AutoSlog extracted from our training data of positive and negative blogs.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"This provides 67,710 additional phrases, including 58,972 positive phrases and 8,738 negative phrases.",3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The retrained model includes both the labels from the original Sentiment Treebank and the AutoSlog high precision phrases.,3 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We present our experimental results and analyze the results in terms of the lexico-functional linguistic patterns we learn.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Baseline Classifiers.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Rows 1-3 of Table 4 show the results for the three baselines, in terms of Fscore for each class and the macro F. Stanford outperforms both NRC and SVM, but misses many cases of positive sentiment.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
AutoSlog Classifier.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Row 4 of Table 4 shows the results for the AutoSlog classifier.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Although AutoSlog itself does not perform highly, the patterns that it learns represent a different type of knowledge than what is contained in many sentiment analysis tools.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We therefore hypothesized that a cascading classifier, which supplements one of the baseline sentiment classifiers with the lexicofunctional patterns that AutoSlog learns might yield higher performance.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Retrained Stanford.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Row 5 of Table 4 shows the results for RETRAINED STANFORD.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
The F-scores for RETRAINED STANFORD are almost identical to the standard Stanford classifier.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
This may be because our data is a small percentage of the entire number of phrases used in training Stanford.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Although RETRAINED STANFORD prioritizes our phrases, it would not make sense to remove the original training data.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Cascading Classifiers.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
We implement cascading classifiers to test our hypothesis.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"The cascade classifier has primary and secondary classifiers, and we invoke the secondary classifiers only if the primary assigns a prediction of neutral to a test instance, which reflects the lack of sentimentbearing lexical items.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We also have a cascade classifier with a tertiary classifier, which is invoked in the same fashion as the secondary classifier after the primary and secondary classifiers have been run.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"The cascading classifiers are named in the order the classifier is employed, primary, secondary or primary, secondary, tertiary.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"For our cascading classifiers, we combine our baseline classifiers (NRC and Stanford), with our AutoSlog classifier.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
We do not use SVM as a primary classifier since it has no neutral label.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"The results for the cascading experiments are in Rows 6-9 of Table 4.
",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Cascading NRC and AutoSlog provides the best performance, improving both the positive and negative classes, for a macro F of 0.71.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This shows that the learned implicit polarity information from AutoSlog improves NRC’s performance.
",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Since our best two-classifier cascade comes
from combining NRC and AutoSlog, we also test a cascade that adds Stanford or SVM.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We achieve our best macro F of 0.75 for the combination with SVM.
Analysis and Discussion.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Here we discuss how the patterns we learned from AutoSlog can supplement the knowledge encoded in current sentiment classifiers, and in newly evolving sentiment resources (Goyal et al., 2010; Choi and Wiebe, 2014; Balahur et al., 2012; Ruppenhofer and Brandes, 2015).
",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Tables 5 and 6 illustrate several learned lexicofunctional patterns for positive events used in the AutoSlog classifier.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"The patterns shown in Table 5 are predicted by A&R’s framework, some functions of which can be seen in Table 1.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"For example, we find a range of basic state descriptions (have party, have cancer) whose basic entailment category is either possessive or property state.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Since Ehave is positive for a first-person subject only if the object is positive, and negative if the object is negative, we predict that parties are good to possess and that cancer is a bad property to have.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"In this way, we can recruit the existing function for have to induce new positive or negative things to “possess.”",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"In line with A&R’s claims, many events are identified with their final results: headed for results in being at a desired location, while not coming home results in something failing to be at a desired location.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We find it a welcome result that our semi-supervised methods
yield patterns that correspond to the A&R classes, thus validating our suspicion that first-person sentences furnish a simplifying test ground for discovering functional patterns in the wild.
",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"However, many patterns are not covered by A&R’s general classes, see Table 6.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Looking first at verbs, one major correlation is between positive classes and public events and negative classes and private states.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Verbs extracted from the positive class tend to be eventive and agentive describing more dynamic activities and interactions, such as played, swim, enjoyed, and danced.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Even many positive have uses are light verbs describing an activity such as have lunch.
",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Verbs from the negative class are strikingly different.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"They are very often stative, where the author is the experiencer (cognitive subject) of that private state.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"While this state vs. event distinction is not one existing computational models of sentiment or affect discuss explicitly, it replicates a finding that consistently emerges in clinical psychology, one that is explicitly argued for in cognitive-behavioral accounts of the mood that particular activities evoke (Lewinsohn et al., 1985; MacPhillamy and Lewinsohn, 1982; Russo et al., 2015).",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"In addition, Table 6 reveals several novel result state categories.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"The success, planning, and unmet desire frames are all ultimately about goalfulfillment (or lack thereof).",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"While the success and unmet desire cases could be understood as having or lacking something, the planning cases indicate steps achieved toward a desired end-state.",4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Previous work on learning affect from eventuality descriptions has largely focused on actions.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Our results indicate that private state descriptions are another rich source of evidence.,4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Previous work learns phrasal markers of implicit polarity via bootstrapping from largescale text sources, e.g. Vu et al. (2014)
learn emotion-specific event types by extracting emotion,event pairs on Twitter.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Li et al. (2014) uses Twitter to bootstrap ‘major life events’ and typical replies to those events.
",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
Ding and Riloff (2016) extract subj-verb-obj triples from blog posts.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
They then apply label propagation to spread polarity from sentences to events.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, the triples they learn do not focus on first-person experiencers.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"They also filter private states out of the verbs used to learn their triples, whereas we have found that verbs relating to private states such as need, want and realize are important indicators of first-person affect.
",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Balahur et al. (2012) use the narratives produced by the ISEAR questionnaire (Scherer et al., 1986) for first-person examples of particular emotions and extract sequences of subject-verb-object triples, which they annotate for basic emotions.
",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recent work has built on this idea, and developed methods to automatically expand Anand & Reschke’s verb classes to create completely new lexical resources (Balahur et al., 2012; Choi and Wiebe, 2014; Deng et al., 2013; Deng and Wiebe, 2014; Ruppenhofer and Brandes, 2015).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Choi & Wiebe’s work comes closest to ours in trying to induce (not annotate) lexical functions, but we attempt to infer these from stories directly, whereas they use a structured lexical resource.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
We show that we can learn lexico-functional linguistic patterns that reliably predict first-person affect.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We constructed a dataset of positive and negative first-person experiencer sentences and used them to learn such patterns.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We then showed that the performance of current sentiment classifiers can be enhanced by augmenting them with these patterns.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"By adding our AutoSlog classifier’s results to existing classifiers we were able to improve from a baseline 0.67 to 0.75 Macro F with a cascading classifier of NRC, AutoSlog and SVM.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In addition, we analyze the linguistic functions that indicate positivity and negativity for the first person experiencer, and show that they are very different.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In first-person descriptions, positivity is often signaled by active participations in events, while negativity involves private states.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In future work, we plan to explore the integration of these observations into sentiment resources such as the +-Effect lexicon (Choi and Wiebe, 2014).",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We plan to apply these high precision first-person lexical patterns beyond blog data and with other personmarking.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Informal first-person narratives are a unique resource for computational models of everyday events and people’s affective reactions to them.,abstractText,[0],[0]
People blogging about their day tend not to explicitly say I am happy.,abstractText,[0],[0]
Instead they describe situations from which other humans can readily infer their affective reactions.,abstractText,[0],[0]
However current sentiment dictionaries are missing much of the information needed to make similar inferences.,abstractText,[0],[0]
We build on recent work that models affect in terms of lexical predicate functions and affect on the predicate’s arguments.,abstractText,[0],[0]
We present a method to learn proxies for these functions from firstperson narratives.,abstractText,[0],[0]

"DR for sequence data aims at learning a subspace by maximizing the separability among sequence classes, where the separability embodies in the differences on temporal structures.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The temporal structures reflect the common evolutions of all sequences from the same class, and they depend on temporal alignments to establish correspondences among sequences with local temporal differences.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The separability and objective are more difficult to formulate and manipulate by nature.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For these reasons, DR for sequence data has received much less attention.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing methods such as Linear Sequence Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) (Su & Ding, 2013; Su et al., 2018) and Max-Min inter-Sequence Distance Analysis (MMSDA) (Su et al., 2017a) construct the separability based on generative models.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For each class, they train a leftto-right Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner, 1989)) from the original sequences.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The mean of the features aligned to each hidden state is calculated, and the means of all ordered states form a mean sequence.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The interclass distance is measured as the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) (Sakoe & Chiba, 1978) distance between the mean sequences.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such separability depends on the alignments between the sequences and the hidden states, which further rely on the similarities of the features.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"When projecting the features to a subspace, the local similarities among the transformed features may change, and hence the alignments may change accordingly.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the projection is determined by maximizing the separability, where the separability should be constructed based on the alignments in the subspace.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, learning the projection and inferring the alignments are entangled.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To make it tractable, existing methods simply fix the alignments in the underlying subspace to those in the original space.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the resulting separability cannot reflect the real confusion relationship between classes in the subspace.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Also, HMM-based separability requires a large number of sequences for training and is poor in scalability.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose a supervised DR method for sequence data called Latent Temporal Linear Discriminant Analysis (LT-LDA).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We learn an abstract template for each class to discover the temporal structures via employ-
ing the modified DTW barycenter (Petitjean et al., 2011; Su et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We then construct the separability among sequence classes based on the alignments between the abstract templates and the training sequences.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although determining the alignments by learning the abstract templates and learning the subspace by maximizing the constructed separability still rely on each other, we show that their objectives are actually connected, which allows us to jointly learn the most discriminative subspace together with the associated latent alignments, resulting in sequences of lowdimensional discriminative temporal representations.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The main contributions are as follows.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"(1) Different from the HMM-based separability, our new construction of separability does not require lots of training data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
It can be performed even when only one training sequence per class is available.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"(2) Different from previous methods where the subspace can only be learned through pre-fixing the alignments, we propose to learn the subspace and the latent alignments simultaneously and develop an efficient iterative solution.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The learned subspace is thereby holistically optimal.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"(3) We establish a connection between our objective formulation and the abstract template learning, which ensures the convergence of our solution.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We further provide theoretical insight on the subspace selection.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Various supervised linear DR methods have been proposed for vector data, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Fisher, 1936), Marginal Fisher Analysis (Yan et al., 2007), and Max-min Distance Analysis (Bian & Tao, 2011; Zhang & Yeung, 2010).",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"LDA optimizing the Fisher criterion is perhaps the most widely used method for its simpleness, effectiveness and the well-established theory, and is getting consistent interest (De la Torre & Kanade, 2006; Ding & Li, 2007; Ye et al., 2007; Nikitidis et al., 2014) in machine learning.",2.

"In (Lajugie et al., 2014), a Mahalanobis distance was learned given the ground-truth alignments of training samples for multivariate sequence alignment, while in our method the alignments of both the training sequences and the test sequences are unavailable.
",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"LSDA (Su & Ding, 2013; Su et al., 2018) and MMSDA (Su et al., 2017a) targeted at the same problem as this paper, where the projection was learned by maximizing the separability defined on HMM-based temporal structures.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
The alignments of the sequences to the hidden states in the original space and the underlying subspace were assumed to be the same.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"LSDA optimized the Fisher criterion and made further approximations on the inter-class scatter to make the optimization tractable; MMSDA optimized the max-min distance criterion, resulting in solving a series of time-consuming semi-definite programming problems and cannot scale to high dimension.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Differently, in our method, the discovery of temporal structures is DTW-based and only depends on deterministic operations, which avoids the estimation of massive parameters of HMM;",2. Related Work,[0],[0]

"Recently, more and more attention from both academia and industry is paying to building nontask-oriented chatbots that can naturally converse with humans on any open domain topics.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing approaches can be categorized into generationbased methods (Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2016; Sordoni et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2017; Serban et al., 2017; Xing et al., 2018) which synthesize a response with natural language generation techniques, and retrievalbased methods (Hu et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017) which select a response from a pre-built index.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we study response selection for retrieval-based chatbots, not only because retrieval-based methods can return fluent and informative responses, but also because they have been successfully applied to many real products such as the social-bot XiaoIce from Microsoft (Shum et al., 2018) and the E-commerce assistant AliMe Assist from Alibaba Group (Li et al., 2017).

"Corresponding Author
A key step to response selection is measuring the matching degree between a response candidate and an input which is either a single message (Hu et al., 2014) or a conversational context consisting of multiple utterances (Wu et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While existing research focuses on how to define a matching model with neural networks, little attention has been paid to how to learn such a model when few labeled data are available.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In practice, because human labeling is expensive and exhausting, one cannot have large scale labeled data for model training.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, a common practice is to transform the matching problem to a classification problem with human responses as positive examples and randomly sampled ones as negative examples.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This strategy, however, oversimplifies the learning problem, as most of the randomly sampled responses are either far from the semantics of the messages or the contexts, or they are false negatives which pollute the training data as noise.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, there often exists a significant gap between the performance of a model in training and the same model in practice (Wang et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017).1
We propose a new method that can effectively leverage unlabeled data for learning matching models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To simulate the real scenario of a retrieval-based chatbot, we construct an unlabeled data set by retrieving response candidates from an index.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Then, we employ a weak annotator to provide matching signals for the unlabeled inputresponse pairs, and leverage the signals to supervise the learning of matching models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The weak annotator is pre-trained from large scale humanhuman conversations without any annotations, and thus a Seq2Seq model becomes a natural choice.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our approach is compatible with any matching models, and falls in a teacher-student framework
1The model performs well on randomly sampled data, but badly on human labeled data.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"(Hinton et al., 2015) where the Seq2Seq model transfers the knowledge from human-human conversations to the learning process of the matching models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Broadly speaking, both of (Hinton et al., 2015) and our work let a neural network supervise the learning of another network.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
An advantage of our method is that it turns the hard zero-one labels in the existing learning paradigm to soft (weak) matching scores.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Hence, the model can learn a large margin between a true response with a true negative example, and the semantic distance between a true response and a false negative example is short.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, due to the simulation of real scenario, harder examples can been seen in the training phase that makes the model more robust in the testing.

"We conduct experiments on two public data sets, and experimental results on both data sets indicate that models learned with our method can significantly outperform their counterparts learned with the random sampling strategy.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our contributions include: (1) proposal of a new method that can leverage unlabeled data to learn matching models for retrieval-based chatbots; and (2) empirical verification of the effectiveness of the method on public data sets.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given a data setD = {xi, (yi,1, . . .",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
", yi,n)}Ni=1 with xi a message or a conversational context and yi,j a response candidate of xi, we aim to learn a matching modelM(·, ·) from D. Thus, for any new pair (x, y),M(x, y) measures the matching degree between x and y.
To obtain a matching model, one has to deal with two problems: (1) how to defineM(·, ·); and (2) how to perform learning.",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
"Existing work focuses on Problem (1) where state-of-the-art methods include dual LSTM (Lowe et al., 2015), MultiView LSTM (Zhou et al., 2016), CNN (Yan et al., 2016), and Sequential Matching Network (Wu et al., 2017), but adopts a simple strategy for Problem (2): ∀xi, a human response is designated as yi,1 with a label 1, and some randomly sampled responses are treated as (yi,2, . . .",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
", yi,n) with labels 0.",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
"M(·, ·) is then learned by maximizing the following objective: ∑N i=1",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
∑n j=1,2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
"[ri,j log(M(xi, yi,j)) + (1− ri,j) log(1−M(xi, yi,j))] ,
(1)
where ri,j ∈ {0, 1} is a label.",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
"While matching accuracy can be improved by carefully designing M(·, ·) (Wu et al., 2017), the bottleneck becomes the learning approach which suffers obvious problems: most of the randomly sampled yi,j are semantically far from xi which may cause an undesired decision boundary at the end of optimization; some yi,j are false negatives.",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
"As hard zero-one labels are adopted in Equation (1), these false negatives may mislead the learning algorithm.",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
"The problems remind us that besides good architectures of matching models, we also need a good approach to learn such models from data.",2.1 The Existing Learning Approach,[0],[0]
"As human labeling is infeasible when training complicated neural networks, we propose a new method that can leverage unlabeled data to learn a matching model.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"Specifically, instead of random sampling, we construct D by retrieving (yi,2, . . .",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
", yi,n) from an index (yi,1 is the human response of xi).",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"By this means, some yi,j are true positives, and some are negatives but semantically close to xi.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"After that, we employ a weak annotatorG(·, ·) to indicate the matching degree of every (xi, yi,j) in D as weak supervision signals.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"Let sij = G(xi, yi,j), then the learning approach can be formulated as:
argmin M(·,·) N∑ i=1",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"n∑ j=1 max(0,M(xi, yi,j)−M(xi, yi,1)+ s′i,j),
(2)
where s′ij is a normalized weak signal defined as max(0,
si,j si,1 − 1).",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"The normalization here elimi-
nates bias from different xi.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"Objective (2) encourages a large margin between the matching of an input and its human response and the matching of the input and a negative response judged by G(·, ·) (as will be seen later, si,jsi,1 > 1).",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"The learning approach simulates how we build a matching model in a retrievalbased chatbot: given {xi}, some response candidates are first retrieved from an index.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
Then human annotators are hired to judge the matching degree of each pair.,2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"Finally, both the data and the human labels are fed to an optimization program for model training.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"Here, we replace the expensive human labels with cheap judgment from G(·, ·).
",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"We define G(·, ·) as a sequence-to-sequence architecture (Vinyals and Le, 2015) with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015), and pre-train it with large amounts of human-human conversa-
tion data.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"The Seq2Seq model can capture the semantic correspondence between an input and a response, and then transfer the knowledge to the learning of a matching model in the optimization of (2).",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"sij is then defined as the likelihood of generating yi,j from xi:
sij = ∑ k log[p(wyi,j ,k, |xi, wyi,j ,l<k)], (3)
where wyi,j ,k is the k-th word of yi,j and wyi,j ,",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"l<k is the word sequence before wyi,j ,k.
Since negative examples are retrieved by a search engine, the oversimplification problem of the negative sampling approach can be partially mitigated.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
We leverage a weak annotator to assign a score for each example to distinguish false negative examples and true negative examples.,2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"Equation (2) turns the hard zero-one labels in Equation (1) to soft matching degrees, and thus our method encourages the model to be more confident to classify a response with a high si,j score as a negative one.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"In this way, we can avoid false negative examples and true negative examples are treated equally during training, and update the model toward a correct direction.
",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"It is noteworthy that although our approach also involves an interaction between a generator and a discriminator, it is different from the GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) in principle.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"GANs try to learn a better generator via an adversarial process, while our approach aims to improve the discriminator with supervision from the generator, which also differentiates it from the recent work on transferring knowledge from a discriminator to a generative visual dialog model (Lu et al., 2017).",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"Our approach is also different from those semi-supervised approaches in the teacher-student framework (Dehghani et al., 2017a,b), as there are no labeled data in learning.",2.2 A New Learning Method,[0],[0]
"We conduct experiments on two public data sets: STC data set (Wang et al., 2013) for single-turn response selection and Douban Conversation Corpus (Wu et al., 2017) for multi-turn response selection.",3 Experiment,[0],[0]

We implement our approach with TensorFlow.,3.1 Implementation Details,[0],[0]
"In both experiments, the same Seq2Seq model is exploited which is trained with 3.3 million inputresponse pairs extracted from the training set of the Douban data.",3.1 Implementation Details,[0],[0]

"Following (Wang et al., 2013, 2015), we combine the score from a matching model with TF-IDF based cosine similarity using RankSVM",3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]

Precision at position 1 (P@1) is employed as an evaluation metric.,3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"In addition to the models compared on the data in the existing literatures, we also implement dual LSTM (Lowe et al., 2015) as a baseline.",3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"As case studies, we learn a dual LSTM and an CNN (Hu et al., 2014) with the proposed approach, and denote them as LSTM+WS (Weak Supervision) and CNN+WS, respectively.",3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"When constructing D, we build an index with the training data using Lucene3 and retrieve 9 candidates (i.e., {yi,2, . .",3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]

"We can see 2http://weibo.sina.com 3https://lucenenet.apache.org/
that CNN and LSTM consistently get improved when learned with the proposed approach, and the improvements over the models learned with random sampling are statistically significant (ttest with p-value < 0.01).",3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"LSTM+WS even surpasses the best performing model, DeepMatchtree, reported on this data.",3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
These results indicate the usefulness of the proposed approach in practice.,3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
One can expect improvements to models like DeepMatchtree with the new learning method.,3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
We leave the verification as future work.,3.2 Single-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
Experiment settings: Douban Conversation Corpus contains 0.5 million context-response (true response) pairs for training and 1000 contexts for test.,3.3 Multi-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"In the test set, every context has 10 response candidates, and each of the response has a label “good” or “bad” judged by human annotators.",3.3 Multi-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"Mean average precision (MAP) (BaezaYates et al., 1999), mean reciprocal rank (MRR) (Voorhees, 1999), and precision at position 1 (P@1) are employed as evaluation metrics.",3.3 Multi-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]

Results: Table 2 reports the results.,3.3 Multi-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"Consistent with the results on the STC data, every model (+WS one) gets improved with the new learning approach, and the improvements are statistically significant (t-test with p-value < 0.01).",3.3 Multi-turn Response Selection,[0],[0]
"Ablation studies: we first replace the weak supervision s′i,j in Equation (2) with a constant selected from {0.1, 0.2, . . .",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]

"Then, we keep
everything the same as our approach but replace D with a set constructed by random sampling, denoted as model+WSrand.",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
Table 3 reports the results.,3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
We can conclude that both the weak supervision and the strategy of training data construction are important to the success of the proposed learning approach.,3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Training data construction plays a more crucial role, because it involves more true positives and negatives with different semantic distances to the positives into learning.
",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
Does updating the Seq2Seq model help?,3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"It is well known that Seq2Seq models suffer from the “safe response” (Li et al., 2016a) problem, which may bias the weak supervision signals to high-frequency responses.",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we attempt to iteratively optimize the Seq2Seq model and the matching model and check if the matching model can be further improved.",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we update the Seq2Seq model every 20 mini-batches with the policy-based reinforcement learning approach proposed in (Li et al., 2016b).",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
The reward is defined as the matching score of a context and a response given by the matching model.,3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, we do not observe significant improvement on the matching model.",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The result is attributed to two factors: (1) it is difficult to significantly im-
prove the Seq2Seq model with a policy gradient based method; and (2) eliminating “safe response” for Seq2Seq model cannot help a matching model to learn a better decision boundary.
",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"How the number of response candidates affects learning: we vary the number of {yi,j}nj=1 in D in {2, 5, 10, 20} and study how the hyperparameter influences learning.",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
We study with LSTM on the STC data and SMN on the Douban data.,3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
Table 4 reports the results.,3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"We can see that as the number of candidates increases, the performance of the the learned models becomes better.",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Even with 2 candidates (one from human and the other from retrieval), our approach can still improve the peformance of matching models.",3.4 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Previous studies focus on architecture design for retrieval-based chatbots, but neglect the problems brought by random negative sampling in the learning process.",4 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose leveraging a Seq2Seq model as a weak annotator on unlabeled data to learn a matching model for response selection.",4 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]

"Structured prediction can be thought of as a generalization of binary classification to structured outputs, where the goal is to jointly predict several dependent variables.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, unlike binary classification, structured prediction presents a set of unique computational and statistical challenges.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The chief being that the number of structured outputs is exponential in the input size.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, in translation tasks, the number of parse trees of a sentence is exponential in the length of the sentence.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, it is very common in such domains to have very few training examples as compared to the size of the output space thereby making generalization to unseen inputs difficult.

"The key computational challenge in structured prediction stems from the inference problem, where a decoder, parameterized by a vector w of weights, predicts (or decodes) the latent structured output y given an observed input x. With the exception of a few special cases, the general inference problem in structured prediction is intractable.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance in many cases the inference problem reduces to the maximum acyclic subgraph problem which is NP-hard and hard to approximate to within a factor of 1/2 of the optimal solution (Guruswami et al., 2008), or cardinality-constrained submodular maximization, which is also NP-hard and hard to compute a solution better than the (1 1/"")-approximate solution returned by a greedy algorithm (Nemhauser et al., 1978).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The learning problem, where the goal is to learn the parameter w of the decoder from a set of labeled training instances, and which involves solving the inference problem as a subroutine, is therefore intractable for all but a few special cases.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Hardness of max-margin learning (SVM) was shown by (Sontag et al., 2010).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Hardness results notwithstanding, various methods — which are worst-case exponential-time — have been developed over the last decade for predicting structured data including conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), and maxmargin approaches (Taskar et al., 2003), to name a few.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In these approaches, learning the parameter w of the decoder involves minimizing a loss function L(w, S) over a data set S of m training pairs {(x
i , y i )}m i=1
.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"One could also take a Bayesian approach and learn a posterior distribution Q over decoder parameters w by minimizing the Gibbs loss E w⇠Q [L(w, S)].",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"McAllester (McAllester, 2007) showed, using the PAC-Bayesian framework, that the commonly used max-margin loss (Taskar et al., 2003) upper bounds the expected Gibbs loss over the data distribution, upto statistical error.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, minimizing the max-margin loss provides a principled way for learning the parameters of a structured decoder.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"More recently, (Honorio & Jaakkola, 2016) showed that minimizing a surrogate randomized loss, where the max-margin loss is computed over a small number of randomly sampled structured outputs, also bounds the Gibbs loss from above upto statistical error.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The above can be thought of as weight based perturbation models.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The perturb-and-MAP framework introduced by
(Papandreou & Yuille, 2011), and henceforth referred to as MAP perturbation, provides an efficient way to generate samples from the Gibbs distribution by injecting random noise (that do not depend on the weights of the decoder w) in the potential or score function of the decoder and then computing the most likely assignment or energy configuration (MAP).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"MAP perturbation models are an attractive alternative to expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations for drawing samples from the Gibbs distribution, in that the former facilitates one-shot sampling.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, learning MAP predictors for structured prediction problems is particularly attractive because the predictions are robust to random noise.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, learning the parameters of such MAP predictors involves solving the MAP problem, which in general is intractable.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
In this paper we obtain a provably polynomial time algorithm for learning the parameters of perturbed MAP predictors with structure based perturbations.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Our contributions.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to obtain generalization bounds for MAPperturbation models with structure-based (Gumbel) perturbations — for detailed comparison with existing literature see Section 6.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While it is well known that Gumbel perturbations induce a conditional random field (CRF) distribution over the structured outputs, we show that the generalization error is upper bounded by a CRF loss up to statistical error.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We obtain Rademacher based uniform convergence guarantees for the latter.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the main contribution of our paper is to obtain a provably polynomial time algorithm for learning MAP-perturbation models for general structured prediction problems.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We propose a novel randomized surrogate loss that lower bounds the CRF loss and still upper bounds the expected loss over data distribution, upto approximation and statistical error terms that decay as eO (1/pm) with m being the number of samples.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While it is NP-Hard to compute and approximate the CRF loss in general (Barahona, 1982; Chandrasekaran et al., 2008), our surrogate loss can be computed in polynomial time.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our results also imply that one can learn parameters of CRF models for structured prediction in polynomial time under certain conditions.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our work is inspired by the work of (Honorio & Jaakkola, 2016) who also propose a polynomial time algorithm for learning the parameters of a structured decoder in the max-margin framework.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast to prior work which consider weight based perturbations, our work is concerned with structure based perturbations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Previous algorithms for learning MAP perturbation models, for instance, the hard-EM algorithm by (Gane et al., 2014) and the moment-matching algorithm by (Papandreou & Yuille, 2011), are in general intractable and have no generalization guarantees.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Lastly, the main conceptual contribution of our work is to demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently learn the parameters of a structured
decoder with generalization guarantees without solving the inference problem exactly.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"We will denote the set of s-sparse d-dimensional vectors by Rd,s.
In the perturb and MAP framework, a stochastic decoder first perturbs the linear score by injecting some independent noise for each structured output y, and then returns the structured output that maximizes the perturbed score.",2. Preliminaries,[0],[0]
Gumbel perturbations are commonly used owing to the max-stability property of the Gumbel distribution.,2. Preliminaries,[0],[0]

Prefetching addresses a critical bottleneck in von Neumann computers: computation is orders of magnitude faster than accessing memory.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This problem is known as the memory wall (Wulf & McKee, 1995), and modern applications can spend over 50% of all compute cycles waiting for data to arrive from memory (Kozyrakis et al., 2010; Ferdman et al., 2012; Kanev et al., 2015).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To mitigate the memory wall, microprocessors use a hierarchical memory system, with small and fast memory close to the processor (i.e., caches), and large yet slower memory farther away.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Prefetchers predict when to fetch what data into cache to reduce memory latency, and the key towards effective prefetching is to attack the difficult problem of predicting memory access patterns.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Predictive optimization such as prefetching is one form of speculation.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Modern microprocessors leverage numerous types of predictive structures to issue speculative requests with the aim of increasing performance.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Historically, most predictors in hardware are table-based.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"That is, future events are expected to correlate with past history tracked in lookup tables (implemented as memory arrays).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"These memory arrays are sized based on the working set, or amount of information that the application actively uses.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the working sets of modern datacenter workloads are orders of magnitude larger than those of traditional workloads such as SPEC CPU2006 and continue to grow (Ayers et al., 2018; Ferdman et al., 2012; Gutierrez et al., 2011; Hashemi et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Prefetchers are hardware structures that predict future memory accesses from past history.,2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
They can largely be separated into two categories: stride prefetchers and correlation prefetchers.,2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
"Stride prefetchers are commonly implemented in modern processors and lock onto stable, repeatable deltas (differences between subsequent memory addresses) (Gindele, 1977; Jouppi, 1990; Palacharla & Kessler, 1994).",2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
"For example, given an access pattern that adds four to a memory address every time (0, 4, 8, 12), a stride prefetcher will learn that delta and try to prefetch ahead of the demand stream, launching parallel accesses to potential future address targets (16, 20, 24) up to a set prefetch distance.
",2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
"Correlation prefetchers try to learn patterns that may repeat, but are not as consistent as a single stable delta (Charney & Reeves, 1995; Lai et al., 2001; Somogyi et al., 2006; Roth et al., 1998).",2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
They store the past history of memory accesses in large tables and are better at predicting more irregular patterns than stride prefetchers.,2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
"Examples of correlation prefetchers include Markov prefetchers (Joseph & Grunwald, 1997), GHB prefetchers (Nesbit & Smith, 2004), and more recent work that utilizes larger in-memory structures (Jain & Lin, 2013).",2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
"Correlation prefetchers require large, costly tables, and are typically not implemented in modern multi-core processors.",2.1. Microarchitectural Data Prefetchers,[0],[0]
Deep learning has become the model-class of choice for many sequential prediction problems.,2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Notably, speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012) and natural language pro-
cessing (Mikolov et al., 2010).",2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In particular, RNNs are a preferred choice for their ability to model long-range dependencies.",2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) have emerged as a popular RNN variant that deals with training issues in standard RNNs, by propagating the internal state additively instead of multiplicatively.",2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"An LSTM is composed of a hidden state h and a cell state c, along with input i, forget f , and output gates o that dictate what information gets stored and propagated to the next timestep.",2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]

",2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The above process forms a single LSTM layer, where W{i,f,o,c} are the weights of the layer, and b{i,f,o,c} are the biases.",2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
LSTM layers can be further stacked so that the output of one LSTM layer at time N becomes the input to another LSTM layer at time N .,2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"It is analogous to having multiple layers in a feed-forward neural network, and allows greater modeling flexibility with relatively few extra parameters.",2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks,[0],[0]
Prefetching is the process of predicting future memory accesses that will miss in the on-chip cache and access memory based on past history.,3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
Each of these memory addresses are generated by a memory instruction (a load/store).,3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"Memory instructions are a subset of all instructions that interact with the addressable memory of the computer system.
",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"Many hardware proposals use two features to make these prefetching decisions: the sequence of caches miss addresses that have been observed so far and the sequence of instruction addresses, also known as program counters
(PCs), that are associated with the instruction that generated each of the cache miss addresses.
",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"PCs are unique tags, that is each PC is unique to a particular instruction that has been compiled from a particular function in a particular code file.",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"PC sequences can inform the model of patterns in the control flow of higher level code, while the miss address sequence informs the model of which address to prefetch next.",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"In modern computer systems, both of these features are represented as 64-bit integers.
",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"Therefore, an initial model could use two input features at a given timestep N .",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"It could use the address and PC that generated a cache miss at that timestep to predict the address of the miss at timestep N + 1.
",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"However, one concern quickly becomes apparent: the address space of an application is extremely sparse.",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"In our training data with O(100M) cache misses, only O(10M) unique cache block miss addresses appear on average out of the entire 264 physical address space.",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"This is further displayed when we plot an example trace from omnetpp (a benchmark from the standard SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite (Sta, 2006)) in Figure 1, where the red datapoints are cache miss addresses1.",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
The wide range and severely multi-modal nature of this space makes it a challenge for time-series regression models.,3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"For example, neural networks tend work best with normalized inputs, however when normalizing this data, the finite precision floating-point representation results in a significant loss of information.",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"This issue affects modeling at both the input and output levels, and we will describe several approaches to deal with both aspects.
",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"1Cache miss addresses are from a three level simulated cache hierarchy with a 32 KB L1, 256 KB L2, and 1.25 MB Last Level Cache (LLC), similar to a single thread context from an Intel Broadwell microprocessor.",3.1. Prefetching as a Prediction Problem,[0],[0]
"Rather than treating the prefetching problem as regression, we opt to treat the address space as a large, discrete vocabulary, and perform classification.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
This is analogous to next-word or character prediction in natural language processing.,3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"The extreme sparsity of the space, and the fact that some addresses are much more commonly accessed than others, means that the effective vocabulary size can actually be manageable for RNN models.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"Additionally, the model gains flexibility by being able to produce multi-modal outputs, compared to unimodal regression techniques that assume e.g., a Gaussian likelihood.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"This idea of treating the output prediction problem as one of classification instead of regression has been successfully used in image (Oord et al., 2016a) and audio generation (Oord et al., 2016b).
",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"However, there are 264 possible softmax targets, so a quantization scheme is necessary.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"Importantly, in order to be useful, a prefetch must be within a cache line to be completely accurate, usually within 64 bytes.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"There is a second order benefit if it is within a page, usually 4096 bytes, but even predicting at the page level would leave 252 possible targets.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"In (Oord et al., 2016b), they predict 16-bit integer values from an acoustic signal.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"To avoid having to apply a softmax over 216 values, they apply a non-linear quantization scheme to reduce the space to 256 categories.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"This form of quantization is inappropriate for our purposes, as it decreases the resolution of addresses towards the extremes of the address space, whereas in prefetching we need high resolution in every area where addresses are used.
",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"Luckily, programs tend to behave in predictable ways, so only a relatively small (but still large in absolute numbers), and consistent set of addresses are ever seen.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"Our primary quantization scheme is to therefore create a vocabulary of common addresses during training, and to use this as the set of targets during testing.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"This reduces the coverage, as there may be addresses at test time that are not seen during training time, however we will show that for reasonablysized vocabularies, we capture a significant proportion of the space.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
The second approach we explore is to cluster the addresses using clustering on the address space.,3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"This is akin to an adaptive form of non-linear quantization.
",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"Due to dynamic side-effects such as address space layout randomization (ASLR), different runs of the same program will lead to different raw address accesses (Team, 2003).",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"However, given a layout, the program will behave in a consistent manner.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"Therefore, one potential strategy is to predict deltas, ∆N = AddrN+1−AddrN , instead of addresses directly.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"These will remain consistent across program executions, and come with the benefit that the number of uniquely occurring deltas is often orders of magnitude smaller than uniquely occurring addresses.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"This is shown in Table 1, where we show the number of unique PCs, addresses, and
deltas across a suite of program trace datasets.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
We also show the number of unique addresses and deltas required to achieve 50% coverage.,3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"In almost all cases, this is much smaller when considering deltas.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
"In our models, we therefore use deltas as inputs instead of raw addresses.",3.2. Prefetching as Classification,[0],[0]
In this section we introduce two LSTM-based prefetching models.,4. Models,[0],[0]
"The first version is analogous to a standard language model, while the second exploits the structure of the memory access space in order to reduce the vocabulary size and reduce the model memory footprint.",4. Models,[0],[0]
Suppose we restricted the output vocabulary size in order to only model the most frequently occurring deltas.,4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"According to Table 1, the size of the vocabulary required in order to obtain at best 50% accuracy is usually O(1000) or less, well within the capabilities of standard language models.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"Our first model therefore restricts the output vocabulary size to a large, but feasible 50,000 of the most frequent, unique deltas.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"For the input vocabulary, we include all deltas as long as they appear in the dataset at least 10 times.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"Expanding the vocabulary beyond this is challenging, both computationally and statistically.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"We leave an exploration of approaches like the hierarchical softmax (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) to future work.
",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"We refer to this model as the embedding LSTM, as illustrated in Figure 2.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
It uses a categorical (one-hot) representation for both the input and output deltas.,4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"At timestep N , the input PCN and ∆N are individually embedded and then the embeddings are concatenated and fed as inputs to a twolayer LSTM.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"The LSTM then performs classification over the delta vocabulary, and the K highest-probability deltas are chosen for prefetching 2.
",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"In a practical implementation, a prefetcher can return several predictions.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"This creates a trade-off, where more predictions increases the probability of a cache hit at the next timestep, but potentially removes other useful items from the cache 3.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
We opt to prefetch the top-10 predictions of the LSTM at each timestep.,4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"Other possibilities that we do not explore here include using a beam-search to predict the next n deltas, or to learn to directly predict N to N +n steps ahead in one forward pass of the LSTM.
",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
There are several limitations to this approach.,4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"First, a large vocabulary increases the model’s computational and storage
2Directly predicting probabilites is another advantage that classification provides over traditional hardware.
",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"3This trade-off is subtle, because some of the addresses may end up being useful at future timesteps.
footprint.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"Second, truncating the vocabulary necessarily puts a ceiling on the accuracy of the model.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"Finally, dealing with rarely occurring deltas is non-trivial, as they will be seen relatively few times during training.",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
"This is known in NLP as the rare word problem (Luong et al., 2015).",4.1. Embedding LSTM,[0],[0]
We hypothesize that much of the interesting interaction between addresses occurs locally in address space.,4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"As one example, data structures like structs and arrays tend to be stored in contiguous blocks, and accessed repeatedly.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"In this model, we exploit this idea to design a prefetcher that very carefully models local context, whereas the embedding LSTM models both local and global context.
",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"By looking at narrower regions of the address space, we can see that there is indeed rich local context.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
We took the set of addresses from omnetpp and clustered them into 6 different regions using k-means.,4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"We show two of the clusters in Figure 3, and the rest can be found in the appendix.
",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"To assess the relative accuracy of modeling local addressspace regions, we first cluster the raw address space using k-means.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"The data is then partitioned into these clusters, and deltas are computed within each cluster.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
A visual example of this is shown in Figure 4a.,4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"We found that one of the major advantages of this approach is that the set of deltas within a cluster is significantly smaller than the global vocabulary, alleviating some of the issues with the embedding LSTM.
",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"To reduce the size of the model, we use a multi-task LSTM to model all of the clusters.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"Stated another way, we use an LSTM to model each cluster independently, but tie the weights of the LSTMs.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"However, we provide the cluster ID as an additional feature, which effectively gives each LSTM

"a different set of biases.
",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"The partitioning of the address space into narrower regions also means that the set of addresses within each cluster will take on roughly the same order of magnitude, meaning that the resulting deltas can be effectively normalized and used as real-valued inputs to the LSTM.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"This allows us to further reduce the size of the model, as we do not need to keep around a large matrix of embeddings.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"Importantly, we still treat next-delta prediction as a classification problem, as we found that regression is still too inaccurate to be practical 4.
",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
This version of the LSTM addresses some of the issues of the embedding LSTM.,4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"The trade-offs are that it requires an additional step of pre-processing to cluster the address space, and that it only models local context.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
"That is, it
4The reason for this is after de-normalization, small inaccuracies become dramatically magnified.
cannot model the dynamics that cause the program to access different regions of the address space.",4.2. Clustering + LSTM,[0],[0]
A necessary condition for neural networks to be effective prefetchers is that they must be able to accurately predict cache misses.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
Our experiments primarily measure their effectiveness in this task when compared with traditional hardware.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
There are many design choices to be made in prefetching beyond the model itself.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Creating a fair comparison is a subtle process, and we outline our choices here.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
The data used in our evaluation is a dynamic trace that contains the sequence of memory addresses that an application computes.,5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
"This trace is captured by using a dynamic instrumentation tool, Pin (Luk et al., 2005), that attaches to the process and emits a ”PC, Virtual Address” tuple into a file every time the instrumented application accesses memory (every load or store instruction).
",5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
"This raw access trace mostly contains accesses that hit in the cache (such as stack accesses, which are present in the data cache).",5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
"Since we are focused on predicting cache misses, we obtain the sequence of cache misses by simulating this trace through a simple cache simulator that emulates an Intel Broadwell microprocessor (Section 3.1).
",5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
"To evaluate our proposals, we use the memory intensive applications of SPEC CPU2006.",5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
This is a standard benchmark suite that is used pervasively to evaluate the performance of computer systems.,5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
"However, SPEC CPU2006 also has small working sets when compared to modern datacenter workloads.",5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
"Therefore in addition to SPEC benchmarks, we also include Google’s web search workload.",5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
Web search is a unique application that exemplifies enterprise-scale software development and drives industrial hardware platforms.,5.1. Data Collection,[0],[0]
"We split each trace into a training and testing set, using 70% for training and 30% for evaluation, and train each LSTM on each dataset independently.",5.2. Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The embedding LSTM was trained with ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2015) while the clustering LSTM was trained with Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011).",5.2. Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We report the specific hyperparameters used in the appendix.,5.2. Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Precision We measure precision-at-10, which makes the assumption that each model is allowed to make 10 predictions at a time.",5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
The model predictions are deemed correct if the true delta is within the set of deltas given by the top-10 predictions.,5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
"A label that is outside of the output vocabulary of the model is automatically deemed to be a failure.
",5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
Recall We measure recall-at-10.,5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
"Each time the model makes predictions, we record this set of 10 deltas.",5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
"At the end, we measure the recall as the cardinality of the set of predicted deltas over the entire set seen at test-time.",5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
"This measures the ability of the prefetcher to make diverse predictions, but does not give any weight to the relative frequency of the different deltas.
",5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
One subtlety involving the clustering + LSTM model is how it is used at test-time.,5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
"In practice, if an address generates a cache miss, then we identify the region of this miss, feed it as an input to the appropriate LSTM, and retrieve predictions.",5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the bandwidth required to make a prediction is nearly identical between the two LSTM variants.",5.3. Metrics,[0],[0]
We compare our LSTM-based prefetchers to two hardware prefetchers.,5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
The first is a standard stream prefetcher.,5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"We simulate a hardware structure that supports up to 10 simul-
taneous streams to maintain parity between the ML and traditional predictors.",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"The second is a GHB PC/DC prefetcher (Nesbit & Smith, 2004).",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
This is a correlation prefetcher that uses two tables.,5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"The first table stores PCs, these PCs then serve as a pointer into the second table where delta history is recorded.",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"On every access, the GHB prefetcher jumps through the second table in order to prefetch deltas that it has recorded in the past.",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"This prefetcher excels at more complex memory access patterns, but has much lower recall than the stream prefetcher.
",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
Figure 5 shows the comparison of the different prefetchers across a range of benchmark datasets.,5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"While the stream prefetcher is able to achieve a high recall due to its dynamic vocabulary, the LSTM models otherwise dominate, especially in terms of precision.
",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"Comparing the embedding LSTM to the cluster + LSTM models, neither model obviously outperforms the other in terms of precision.",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
The clustering +,5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"LSTM tends to generate much higher recall, likely the result of having multiple vocabularies.",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"An obvious direction is to ensemble these models, which we leave for future work.",5.4. Model Comparison,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we remove one of the ∆s or PCs from the embedding LSTM inputs, and measure the change in predictive ability.",5.5. Predictive information of ∆s vs PCs,[0],[0]
"This allows us to determine the relative information content contained in each input modality.
",5.5. Predictive information of ∆s vs PCs,[0],[0]
"As Figure 6 shows, both PCs and deltas contain a good amount of predictive information.",5.5. Predictive information of ∆s vs PCs,[0],[0]
"Most of the information required for high precision is contained within the delta sequence, however the PC sequence helps improve recall.",5.5. Predictive information of ∆s vs PCs,[0],[0]
One of the key advantages of using a model to learn patterns that generalize (as opposed to lookup tables) is that the model can then be introspected in order to gain insights into the data.,5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
"In Figure 7, we show a t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) visualization of the final state of the concatenated (∆, PC) embeddings on mcf, colored according to PCs.
",5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
There is clearly a lot of structure to the space.,5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
"Linking PCs back to the source code in mcf, we observe one cluster that consists of repetitions of the same code statement, caused by the compiler unrolling a loop.",5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
"A different cluster consists only of pointer dereferences, as the application traverses a linked list.",5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
Applications besides mcf show this learned structure as well.,5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
In omnetpp we find that inserting and removing into a data structure are mapped to the same cluster and data comparisons are mapped into a different cluster.,5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
"We show these code examples in the appendix, and leave further inspection for future work, but the model appears to be learning about the higher level structure of the application.",5.6. Interpreting Program Semantics,[0],[0]
"Machine learning in microarchitecture and computer systems is not new, however the application of machine learning as a complete replacement for traditional systems, especially using deep learning, is a relatively new and largely uncharted area.",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Here we outline several threads of interaction
between machine learning and microarchitecture research.
",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
Prior work has also directly applied machine learning techniques to microarchitectural problems.,6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Notably, the perceptron branch predictor (Jiménez & Lin, 2001) uses a linear classifier to predict whether a branch is taken or not-taken.",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
The perceptron learns in an online fashion by incrementing or decrementing weights based on taken/not-taken outcome.,6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"The key benefit of the perceptron is its simplicity, eschewing more complicated training algorithms such as back-propagation to meet tight latency requirements.
",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Other applications of machine learning in microarchitecture include applying reinforcement learning for optimizing the long-term performance of memory controller scheduling algorithms (Ipek et al., 2008), tuning performance knobs (Blanton et al., 2015), and using bandits to identify patterns in hardware and software features that relate to a memory access (Peled et al., 2015).
",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Recent work also proposed an LSTM-based prefetcher and evaluated it with generated traces following regular expressions (Zeng, October 2017).",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Using the squared loss, the model caters to capturing regular, albeit non-stride, patterns.",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Irregular memory reference patterns, either due to workload behavior or multi-core processor reordering/interleaving, pose challenges to such regression-based approaches.",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
Zeng (October 2017) evaluate their model on randomly generated patterns.,6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"As detailed in Section 3, we have found regression models to be a poor fit on real workloads.
",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Very recent work has also explored the usage of machine learning to replace conventional database index structures such as b-trees and bloom filters (Kraska et al., 2017).",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Although the nature of this problem differs from cache prefetching, there are many similarities as well.",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Specifically, the idea of using the distribution of the data to learn specific models as opposed to deploying generic data structures.",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
Our clustering approach is also reminiscent of the hierarchical approach that they deploy.,6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
"Importantly, they find that neural network models are faster to query than conventional data structures.",6.1. Machine Learning in Microarchitecture,[0],[0]
Memory traces can be thought of as a representation of program behavior.,6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"Specifically, they represent a bottom-up view of the dynamic interaction of a pre-specified program with a particular set of data.",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"From a machine learning perspective, researchers have taken a top-down approach to explore whether neural networks can understand program behavior and structure.
",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"One active area of research is program synthesis, where a full program is generated from a partial specification– usually input/output examples.",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
Zaremba & Sutskever (2014) use an LSTM to estimate the output of a randomly generated program.,6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"The model can only see the sequence of ASCII characters representing the program, and must also generate the resulting output as a sequence of characters.",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"Zaremba & Sutskever (2014) falls into the category of sequence-tosequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014).",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"Another example
in this category is the Neural Turing Machine, which augments an LSTM with an external memory and an attention mechanism to form a differentiable analog of a Turing machine (Graves et al., 2014).",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"This is used to solve simple problems such as sorting, copying, and associative recall.
",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"There is also work on modeling source code directly, as opposed to modeling properties of the resulting program.",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"For example, (Maddison & Tarlow, 2014) creates a generative model of source code using a probabilistic context-free grammar.",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"(Hindle et al., 2012) models source code as if it were natural language using an n-gram model.",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"This approach has been extended to neural language models for source code (White et al., 2015).",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
"Lastly, Cummins et al. use neural networks to mine online code repositories to automatically synthesize applications (Cummins et al., 2017).",6.2. Machine Learning of Program Behavior,[0],[0]
Computer architects have long exploited the benefits of learning and predicting program behaviors to unlock control and data parallelism.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"The conventional approach of table-based predictors, however, is too costly to scale for data-intensive irregular workloads and showing diminishing returns.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
The models described in this paper demonstrate significantly higher precision and recall than table-based approaches.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"This study also motivates a rich set of questions that this initial exploration does not solve, and we leave these for future research.
",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We have focused on a train-offline test-online model, using precision and recall as evaluation metrics.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"A prefetcher, through accurate prefetching, can change the distribution of cache misses, which could make a static RNN model less effective.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"There are several ways to alleviate this, such as adapting the RNN online, however this could increase the computational and memory burden of the prefetcher.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"One could also try training on hits and misses, however this can significantly change the distribution and size of the dataset.
",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
There is a notion of timeliness that is also an important consideration.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"If the RNN prefetches a line too early, it risks evicting data from the cache that the processor hasn’t used yet.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"If it prefetches too late, the performance impact of the request is minimal, as much of the latency cost of accessing main memory has already been paid.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"One simple heuristic is to predict several steps ahead, instead of just the next step.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"This would be similar to the behavior of stream prefetchers.
",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, the effectivenss of an RNN prefetcher must eventually be measured in terms of its performance impact within a program.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Ideally the RNN would be directly optimized for this.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"This and the previous issues motivate the use of reinforcement learning techniques (Sutton & Barto, 1998) as a method to train these RNNs in dynamic environments.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Indeed, modern microarchitectures also employ control sys-
tems to control prefetcher aggressiveness, and this provides yet another area in which neural networks could be used.
",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Additionally, we have not evaluated the hardware design aspect of our models.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Correlation based prefetchers are difficult to implement in hardware because of their memory size.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"While it is unclear if RNNs can meet the latency demands required for a hardware accelerator, neural networks also significantly compress learned representations during training, and shift the problem to a compute problem rather than a memory capacity problem.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Given the recent proliferation of ML accelerators, this shift towards compute leaves us optimistic at the prospects of neural networks in this domain.
",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Prefetching is not the only domain where computer systems employ speculative execution.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Branch prediction is the process of predicting the direction of branches that an application will take.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Branch target buffers predict the address that a branch will redirect control flow to.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Cache replacement algorithms predict the best line to evict from a cache when a replacement decision needs to be made.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
One consequence of replacing microarchitectural heuristics with learned systems is that we can introspect those systems in order to better understand their behavior.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Our t-SNE experiments only scratch the surface and show an opportunity to leverage much of the recent work in understanding RNN systems (Murdoch & Szlam, 2017; Murdoch et al., 2018).
",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
The t-SNE results also indicate that an interesting view of memory access traces is that they are a reflection of program behavior.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"A trace representation is necessarily different from e.g., input-output pairs of functions, as in particular, traces are a representation of an entire, complex, human-written program.",7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
This view of learning dynamic behavior provides a different path towards building neural systems that learn and replicate program behavior.,7. Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]

AD affects language and some of its symptoms include difficulties in word-finding and changes in the voice.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Detecting these subtle changes can help identify AD at an early stage.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

to detect AD.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

Text representation is a crucial problem in most natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In monolingual IR, early research works mostly use vector space models for query-document semantic matching (Salton et al., 1975), which suffer from the problem of synonymy and polysemy.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In order to bridge the lexical gaps, latent semantic models such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) have been proposed to abstract away from surface text
forms to approximate semantics.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More recently, text representation learned with neural networks is attracting increasing attention of the IR community (Mitra and Craswell, 2017) and positive results have been reported on various evaluation data sets (Fan et al., 2018).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Compared to the prosperity in monolingual IR, there have been less advancements in CLIR where documents are written in a language different from that of queries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to document ranking, CLIR models need to cross the language barriers, which makes the task intuitively more difficult than monolingual IR.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Traditional approaches reduce CLIR to its monolingual counterpart via performing some way of translation on queries or/and documents.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The typical translation process is performed with either off-the-shelf machine translation (MT) systems or multilingual dictionaries (Nie, 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, MT based approaches are far from being a suitable solution for solving CLIR problems (refer to detailed analysis in (Zhou et al., 2012)).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Dictionary-based approaches suffer from the same problem of lexical gaps as in the monolingual case (Gupta et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An efficient cross-language representation is in need for CLIR, which is expected to be able to cross both the language and lexical gaps.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The most intuitive idea one can have so as to represent text in cross-language settings is to extend those models in monolingual environment.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, we note studies such as the extension of LSA in (Littman et al., 1998), the extension of principle component analysis (PCA) in (Platt et al., 2010), the extension of autoencoder model in (Chandar et al., 2014), and the extension of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) in (Vulić and Moens, 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These approaches construct crosslanguage and semantic-rich representation of text, which can be applied to CLIR directly.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, all the models listed here aim to learn general text
representation where the objective is to capture term proximity rather than relevance that is essential for retrieval task (Zamani and Croft, 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A recent work (Gupta et al., 2017) tries to learn taskspecific representation for CLIR.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, their model only captures ranking signals in monolingual settings, which does not necessarily generalize well in CLIR.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose to learn task-specific text representation for CLIR via a novel adversarial learning framework.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Following the convention in generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), our representation learning model is realized as an interplay between two processes, an embedding generator (G) and an adversarial discriminator (D), conducted as a minmax game.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"With the GAN framework, we design three constraints to direct the representation learning process.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
CLIR is essentially a ranking problem and we develop a matching constraint to make sure that documents can be ranked in the right order given a query in another language.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The matching constraint considers both cross-language and monolingual pairwise ranking signals, which is superior to previous studies (e.g., (Gupta et al., 2017)) only considering monolingual matching signals.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Meanwhile, a translation constraint is imposed on the latent representation to bridge the language gaps.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These two constraints direct the encoding networks to generate a language-invariant and task-specific representation in the embedding space.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Lastly, an adversarial constraint is proposed to force both language and source invariant to be reached more efficiently and effectively.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Through the joint exploitation of these constraints in an adversarial manner, the embedding space being optimal for CLIR will then result through the convergence of this process.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Comprehensive CLIR experiments reveal that our model is superior to state-of-the-art continuous space models and approaches the machine translation and monolingual baselines.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Text representation has been a long-standing research question in IR.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Classic methods such as vector space model are not able to deal with lexical gaps between queries and documents, resulting in inferior retrieval performance.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Latent semantic approaches such as LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.,
2003) abstract away from surface text forms to alleviate sparsity and approximate semantics.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"More recently, learning based approaches with neural networks have gained great success in NLP (Baroni et al., 2014) and started to attract increasing interests of the IR community.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In terms of word level embedding, word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) are two models that have been cited frequently in recent literature.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"These two models provide semantic-rich representations to bridge lexical gaps between queries and documents, which have been used broadly in neural IR studies (Ganguly et al., 2015; Zheng and Callan, 2015; Zamani and Croft, 2016).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"The above studies deal with monolingual text representation, which are related to the crosslanguage models presented below.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"As for CLIR, typical approaches reduce CLIR to its monolingual counterparts via performing some way of translation.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Machine translation systems such as Google translator1 have been widely used to translate queries or documents, which serve as a default and convenient translation option in CLIR.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"It is however far from being a suitable solution for solving CLIR problems (a detailed analysis can be found in (Zhou et al., 2012)).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"An alternative solution is to rely on multilingual dictionaries to perform lexicon-level translation, which is mostly in combination with either language modeling strategy (Kraaij et al., 2003) or query structuring framework (Pirkola, 1998).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"However, dictionary-based methods still suffer from the lexical gap problem which reduces their performance in CLIR.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In fact, researchers have extended the models in monolingual settings and developed continuous space models for cross-language tasks to capture rich semantics.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
These cross-language extensions can be applied to CLIR directly.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"For instance, Littman et al. (1998) extend LSA to its cross-language version CL-LSA by concatenating document-term matrix of parallel data which acts as dual-language documents to be learned by LSA.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Such a methodology leads to a dual-language semantic space in which terms from both languages are represented.,2 Related work,[0],[0]

PCA that is then made discriminative by encouraging comparable document pairs to have similar vector representation.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Compared to CL-LSA, OPCA avoids the use of artificial concatenated documents.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"More recently, neural models have been employed to learn cross-language representations.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"For instance, autoencoder is extended to a bilingual version BAE in (Chandar et al., 2014) which learns vectorial word representations from aligned sentences.",2 Related work,[0],[0]

"A recent work (Gupta et al., 2017) tries to learn task-specific embeddings for CLIR.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"However, it learns ranking signals by preserving pairwise ranking in monolingual settings prior to a transfer learning process to another language, which does not necessarily generalize well in CLIR.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"One can find from above analysis that, most existing approaches, either based on neural networks or not, learn general embeddings irrelevant to CLIR.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"We argue that task-specific embeddings are superior, a fact that is inspired by monolingual IR studies and that will actually be validated by CLIR experiments in this paper.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"To this end, we will learn cross-language and task-specific embeddings for CLIR via a novel text representation model based on adversarial learning (Goodfellow et al., 2014).",2 Related work,[0],[0]

There have been various approaches one can use to encode sentences/documents into dense vectors.,3.1 Text representation networks,[0],[0]
"For instance, models based on convolutional neural networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) and models based on recurrent neural networks (Liu et al., 2016) have been popular choices.
",3.1 Text representation networks,[0],[0]
"In order to map queries and documents into the embedding space, we make use of recurrent neural network with the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that can deal with vanishing and exploring gradient problems (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).",3.1 Text representation networks,[0],[0]
We present here derivation details of LSTM for clarification sake.,3.1 Text representation networks,[0],[0]
The LSTM framework consists of several gates to control the cell state in the network.,3.1 Text representation networks,[0],[0]

"Since queries in IR tasks tend to be short and noisy, we make use of Bidirectional LSTM with pooling (Tan et al., 2015) to obtain a more effective text representation from all the hidden states h1:l.

The new hidden state hτab at time step τ is obtained by concatenating the hidden states of LSTMa and LSTMb at their respective time step τ .,3.1 Text representation networks,[0],[0]
"Since max-pooling has been proven to be efficient in similar tasks (Tan et al., 2015), the latent representation zx of x can be formulated as:

"where x can be qs, qt or dt. NNdim is designed to adapt the output dimension and to allow further flexibility for representation learning.",3.1 Text representation networks,[0],[0]
Document ranking is the central problem in both monolingual IR and CLIR tasks.,3.2 Matching constraint and Translation constraint,[0],[0]
"CLIR differs itself from its monolingual counterpart in that the
language gap needs to be crossed prior to the retrieval process.",3.2 Matching constraint and Translation constraint,[0],[0]
"Since the choice of translation strategies (query, document or both) affects the design of other components in our model, we will discuss the translation constraint in section 3.2.1 prior to matching constraints in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.",3.2 Matching constraint and Translation constraint,[0],[0]
"The translation constraint is developed to minimize the differences between a pair of parallel texts, which serves as a basic requirement in the translation scenario.",3.2.1 Translation constraint,[0],[0]
Such a constraint directs the learning of language-invariant text representation for CLIR.,3.2.1 Translation constraint,[0],[0]
"We follow the arguments in previous studies (Vilares et al., 2016) and choose to translate queries in our model, since it is computationally expensive to translate large-scale document collections in practice.",3.2.1 Translation constraint,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we directly employ Google translator to translate queries, which is a popular choice for machine translation that leads to state-of-the-art translation performance.",3.2.1 Translation constraint,[0],[0]
The translation constraint is then imposed on the embedding vectors zqs and zqt of the queries qs and qt.,3.2.1 Translation constraint,[0],[0]

for xqs can be chosen as the most relevant texts according to annotation, and the negative sample xdt− is picked randomly from the data collection.",3.2.2 Cross-language matching constraint,[0],[0]
The cross-language matching constraint encourages the hidden representation of xdt+ to be near to the hidden representation of xqs in the semanticrich embedding space.,3.2.2 Cross-language matching constraint,[0],[0]

"GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014) simultaneously trains a generative model G and a disriminative model D in a competing way.",3.3 Adversarial constraint,[0],[0]
G generates samples from a source of noisew that satisfies w ∼ Pn(w) and tries to capture the real data distribution,3.3 Adversarial constraint,[0],[0]
"Pr. D learns to distinguish between the generated samples from G and the true data sampled from Pr (in practice, from training data).",3.3 Adversarial constraint,[0],[0]
The training procedure for G is to try its best to fool D. Let us assume that G generates samples satisfying the distribution Pg that is implicitly decided by G(w).,3.3 Adversarial constraint,[0],[0]

"We can adjust equation 1 to our settings and obtain the adversarial loss Ladv on a query set Qt and a document set Dt in the target language, as well as a query set Qs in the source language, which can be written as:

"Following the training convention of GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014), the process of learning the language-invariant and task-specific text representation for CLIR should be conducted by jointly minimizing the generator constraint LG and the adversarial loss Ladv, which leads us to the combined objective function L as:
L = LG + Ladv
According to the rule of playing the minmax game in GAN, G tries its best to maximize the probability that D makes a mistake and D tries its best to distinguish between real data and generated data (in our case, various input sources).",3.4 Training procedure,[0],[0]
The theoretical requirement behind GAN that D is maintained near its optimal solution as long as G changes slowly enough motivates us to update the discriminator part k steps per update of the generator part in the iterative optimization process.,3.4 Training procedure,[0],[0]

"With the continued success of encoder-decoder models for machine translation and related tasks, there has been great interest in extending these methods to build general-purpose, data-driven natural language generation (NLG) systems (Mei et al., 2016; Dušek and Jurcıcek, 2016; Lebret et al., 2016; Chisholm et al., 2017; Wiseman et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These encoder-decoder models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) use a neural encoder model to represent a source knowledge base, and a decoder model to emit a textual description word-by-word, conditioned on the source encoding.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This style of generation contrasts with the more traditional division of labor in NLG, which famously emphasizes addressing the two questions of “what to say” and “how to say it” separately, and which leads to systems with explicit content selection, macro- and micro-planning, and surface realization components (Reiter and Dale, 1997; Jurafsky and Martin, 2014).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Encoder-decoder generation systems appear to have increased the fluency of NLG outputs, while reducing the manual effort required.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, due to the black-box nature of generic encoderdecoder models, these systems have also largely sacrificed two important desiderata that are often found in more traditional systems, namely (a) interpretable outputs that (b) can be easily controlled in terms of form and content.

"This work considers building interpretable and controllable neural generation systems, and proposes a specific first step: a new data-driven generation model for learning discrete, template-like

We further describe efficient methods for training this model in an entirely data-driven way by backpropagation through inference.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Generating with the template-like structures induced by the neural HSMM allows for the explicit representation of what the system intends to say (in the form of a learned template) and how it is attempting to say it (in the form of an instantiated template).

"We show that we can achieve performance competitive with other neural NLG approaches, while making progress satisfying the above two desiderata.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Concretely, our experiments indicate that we can induce explicit templates (as shown in Figure 1) while achieving competitive automatic scores, and that we can control and interpret our generations by manipulating these templates.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, while our experiments focus on the data-to-text regime, we believe the proposed methodology represents a compelling approach to learning discrete, latent-variable representations of conditional text.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A core task of NLG is to generate textual descriptions of knowledge base records.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]

"For instance, many authors induce templates by clustering sentences and then abstracting templated fields with hand-engineered rules (Angeli et al., 2010; Kondadadi et al., 2013; Howald et al., 2013), or with a pipeline of other automatic approaches (Wang and Cardie, 2013).

The goal of this work is to propose an approach to neural NLG that addresses these issues in a principled way.,3 Overview: Data-Driven NLG,[0],[0]
We target this goal by proposing a new model that generates with template-like objects induced by a neural HSMM (see Figure 1).,3 Overview: Data-Driven NLG,[0],[0]
"Templates are useful here because they represent a fixed plan for the generation’s content, and because they make it clear what part of the generation is associated with which record in the knowledge base.",3 Overview: Data-Driven NLG,[0],[0]
What does it mean to learn a template?,4 Background: Semi-Markov Models,[0],[0]
"It is natural to think of a template as a sequence of typed text-segments, perhaps with some segments acting as the template’s “backbone” (Wang and Cardie, 2013), and the remaining segments filled in from the knowledge base.
",4 Background: Semi-Markov Models,[0],[0]
"A natural probabilistic model conforming with this intuition is the hidden semi-markov model (HSMM) (Gales and Young, 1993; Ostendorf et al., 1996), which models latent segmentations in an output sequence.",4 Background: Semi-Markov Models,[0],[0]
"Informally, an HSMM is much like an HMM, except emissions may last multiple time-steps, and multi-step emissions need not be independent of each other conditioned on the state.

An HSMM specifies a joint distribution on the observations and latent segmentations.,4 Background: Semi-Markov Models,[0],[0]
"Letting θ denote all the parameters of the model, and using the variables introduced above, we can write the corresponding joint-likelihood as follows

"For this model, we will in fact use p(yt−lt+i=w | y1:t−lt+i−1, zt= k, x) in defining our emission model, which is easily implemented by using an additional RNN run over all the preceding tokens.",5.1 Parameterization,[0],[0]

"Moreover, because the discrete states align with particular fields (see below), it is generally simple to automatically infer to which fields particular latent states correspond, allowing users to choose which template best meets their requirements.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We emphasize that this level of controllability is much harder to obtain for encoderdecoder models, since, at best, a large amount of sampling would be required to avoid generating around a particular mode in the conditional distribution, and even then it would be difficult to control the sort of generations obtained.
",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Interpretable States Discrete states also provide a method for interpreting the generations produced by the system, since each segment is explicitly typed by the current hidden state of the model.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Table 4 shows the impact of varying the template z(i) for a single x from the WikiBio dataset.,7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"While there is in general surprisingly little stylistic variation in the WikiBio data itself, there is variation in the information discussed, and the templates capture this.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we see that particular discrete states correspond in a consistent way to particular pieces of information, allowing us to align states with particular field types.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For instance, birth names have the same hidden state (132), as do names (117), nationalities (82), birth dates (101), and occupations (20).
",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To demonstrate empirically that the learned states indeed align with field types, we calculate the average purity of the discrete states learned for both datasets in Table 5.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In particular, for each discrete state for which the majority of its generated words appear in some rj , the purity of a state’s record type alignment is calculated as the percentage of the state’s words that come from the most frequent record type the state represents.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
This calculation was carried out over training examples that belonged to one of the top 100 most frequent templates.,7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Table 5 indicates that discrete states learned on the E2E data are quite pure.,7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Discrete states learned on the WikiBio data are less pure, though still rather impressive given that there are approximately 1700 record types represented in the WikiBio data, and we limit the number of states to 135.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Unsurprisingly, adding autoregressiveness to the model decreases purity on both datasets, since the model may rely on the autoregressive RNN for typing, in addition to the state’s identity.",7.1 Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We have developed a neural, template-like generation model based on an HSMM decoder, which can be learned tractably by backpropagating through a dynamic program.",8 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"The method allows us to extract template-like latent objects in a principled way in the form of state sequences, and then generate with them.",8 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
This approach scales to large-scale text datasets and is nearly competitive with encoder-decoder models.,8 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"More importantly, this approach allows for controlling the diversity of generation and for producing interpretable states during generation.",8 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We view this work both as the first step towards learning discrete latent variable template models for more difficult generation tasks, as well as a different perspective on learning latent variable text models in general.",8 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Future work will examine encouraging the model to learn maximally different (or minimal) templates, which our objective does not explicitly encourage, templates of larger textual phenomena, such as paragraphs and documents, and hierarchical templates.",8 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]

Learning Neural Templates for Text Generation,title,[0],[0]
Developing provably efficient algorithms for learning commonly used neural network architectures continues to be a core challenge in machine learning.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The underlying difficulty arises from the highly non-convex nature of the optimization problems posed by neural networks.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Obtaining provable guarantees for learning even very basic architectures remains open.

"The main contribution of this paper is a simple, stochastic update algorithm Convotron (Algorithm 1) for provably learning the above convolutional architecture.",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"The algorithm has the following properties:
• Works for general classes of overlapping patches and requires mild distributional conditions.
",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"• Proper recovery of the unknown weight vector.
",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"• Stochastic in nature with a “gradient-like” update step.
• Requires no special/random initialization scheme or tuning of the learning rate.
",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"• Tolerates noise and succeeds in the probabilistic concept model of learning.
",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"• Logarithmic convergence in 1/ , the error parameter, in the realizable setting.
",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
This is the first efficient algorithm for learning general classes of overlapping patches (and the first algorithm for any class of patches that succeeds under mild distributional assumptions).,1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"Prior work has focused on analyzing SGD in the realizable/noiseless setting with the caveat of requiring either disjoint patches (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017; Du et al., 2017b) with Gaussian inputs or technical conditions linking the underlying true parameters and the “closeness of patches” (Du et al., 2017a).
",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"In contrast, our conditions depend only on the patch structure itself and can be efficiently verified.",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
Commonly used patch structures in computer vision applications such as 1D/2D grids satisfy our conditions.,1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"Additionally, we require only that the underlying distribution on samples is symmetric and induces a covariance matrix on the patches with polynomially bounded condition number1.",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
All prior work handles only continuous distributions.,1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
Another major difference from prior work is that we give guarantees using purely empirical updates.,1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"That is, we do not require an assumption that we have access to exact quantities such as the population gradient of the loss function.
",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"We further show that in the commonly studied setting of Gaussian inputs and non-overlapping patches, updating with respect to a single non-overlapping patch is sufficient to guarantee convergence.",1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
This indicates that the Gaussian/nooverlap assumption is quite strong.,1.1. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
Our approach is to exploit the monotonicity of the activation function instead of the strong convexity of the loss surface.,1.2. Our Approach,[0],[0]
We use ideas from isotonic regression and extend them in the context of convolutional networks.,1.2. Our Approach,[0],[0]
"These ideas have been successful for learning generalized linear models (Kakade et al., 2011), improperly learning fully connected, depththree neural networks (Goel & Klivans, 2017b), and learning graphical models (Klivans & Meka, 2017).",1.2. Our Approach,[0],[0]
"It is known that in the worst case, learning even simple neural networks is computationally intractable.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, in the non-realizable (agnostic) setting, it is known that learning a single ReLU (even for bounded distributions and unit norm hidden weight vectors) with respect to square-loss is as hard as learning sparse parity with noise (Goel et al., 2016), a notoriously difficult problem from computational learning theory.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For learning one hidden layer convolutional networks, Brutzkus and Globerson (Brutzkus & Glober-

son, 2017) proved that distribution-free recoverability of the unknown weight vector is NP-hard, even if we restrict to disjoint patch structures.
",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"As such, a major open question is to discover the mildest assumptions that lead to polynomial-time learnability for simple neural networks.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we consider the very popular class of convolutional neural networks (for a summary of other recent approaches for learning more general architectures see (Goel & Klivans, 2017a)).",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For convolutional networks, all prior research has focused on analyzing conditions under which (Stochastic) Gradient Descent converges to the hidden weight vector in polynomial-time.
",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Along these lines, Brutzkus and Globerson (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017) proved that with respect to the spherical Gaussian distribution and for disjoint (non-overlapping) patch structures, gradient descent recovers the weight vector in polynomial-time.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Zhong et al. (Zhong et al., 2017a) showed that gradient descent combined with tensor methods can recover one hidden layer involving multiple weight vectors but still require a Gaussian distribution and nonoverlapping patches.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Du et al. (Du et al., 2017b) proved that gradient descent recovers a hidden weight vector involved in a type of two-layer convolutional network under the assumption that the distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the patches are disjoint, and the learner has access to the true population gradient of the loss function.
",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"We specifically highlight the work of Du, Lee, and Tian (Du et al., 2017a), who proved that gradient descent recovers a hidden weight vector in a one-layer convolutional network under certain technical conditions that are more general than the Gaussian/no-overlap patch scenario.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their conditions involve a certain “alignment” of the unknown patch structure, the hidden weight vector, and the (continuous) marginal distribution.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, it is unclear which concrete patch-structure/distributional combinations their framework captures.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"We also note that all of the above results assume there is no noise; i.e.,, they work in the realizable setting.

We learn from code-switched social media by extending the polylingual topic model framework to infer the language of each token and then automatically processing the learned topics to identify aligned topics.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model improves both in terms of perplexity and a human evaluation, and we provide some example analyses of social media that rely on our learned topics.

Code-switched documents has received considerable attention in the NLP community.,2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"Several tasks have focused on identification and analysis, including mining translations in code-switched documents (Ling et al., 2013), predicting codeswitched points (Solorio and Liu, 2008a), identifying code-switched tokens (Lignos and Marcus, 2013; Yu et al., 2012; Elfardy and Diab, 2012), adding code-switched support to language models (Li and Fung, 2012), linguistic processing of code switched data (Solorio and Liu, 2008b), corpus creation (Li et al., 2012; Diab and Kamboj, 2011), and computational linguistic analyses and theories of code-switching (Sankofl, 1998; Joshi, 1982).
",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
Code-switching specifically in social media has also received some recent attention.,2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
Lignos and Marcus (2013) trained a supervised token level language identification system for Spanish and English code-switched social media to study codeswitching behaviors.,2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"Ling et al. (2013) mined translation spans for Chinese and English in codeswitched documents to improve a translation system, relying on an existing translation model to aid in the identification and extraction task.",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"In contrast to this work, we take an unsupervised approach, relying only on readily available document level language ID systems to utilize code-switched data.",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"Additionally, our focus is not on individual messages, rather we aim to train a model that can be used to analyze entire corpora.
",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"In this work we consider two types of codeswitched documents: single messages and conversations, and two language pairs: Chinese-English and Spanish-English.",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"Figure 1 shows an example of a code-switched Spanish-English conversation, in which three users discuss Mexico’s football team advancing to the Gold medal game in the 2012 Summer Olympics.",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"In this conversation, some tweets are code-switched and some are in a single language.",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
By collecting the entire conversation into a single document we provide the topic model with additional content.,2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"An example of a Chinese-English code-switched messages is given by Ling et al. (2013):
watup Kenny Mayne!!",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
-,2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"Kenny Mayne 最近这么样啊!!
",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
Here a user switches between languages in a single message.,2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"We empirically evaluate our model on
both conversations and messages.",2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
In the model presentation we will refer to both as “documents.”,2 Code-Switching,[0],[0]
"To train a polylingual topic model on social media, we make two modifications to the model of Mimno et al. (2009): add a token specific language variable, and a process for identifying aligned topics.
",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"First, polylingual topic models require parallel or comparable corpora in which each document has an assigned language.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"In the case of code-switched social media data, we require a pertoken language variable.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"However, while document level language identification (LID) systems are common place, very few languages have pertoken LID systems (King and Abney, 2013; Lignos and Marcus, 2013).
",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"To address the lack of available LID systems, we add a per-token latent language variable to the polylingual topic model.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"For documents that are not code-switched, we observe these variables to be the output of a document level LID system.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"In the case of code-switched documents, these variables are inferred during model inference.
",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"Second, polylingual topic models assume the aligned topics are from parallel or comparable corpora, which implicitly assumes that a topics popularity is balanced across languages.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
Topics that show up in one language necessarily show up in another.,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"However, in the case of social media, we can make no such assumption.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"The topics discussed are influenced by users, time, and location, all factors intertwined with choice of language.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"For example, English speakers will more likely discuss Olympic basketball while Spanish speakers football.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"There may be little or no documents on a given topic in one language, while they are plentiful in another.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"In this case, a polylingual topic model, which necessarily infers a topicspecific word distribution for each topic in each language, would learn two unrelated word distributions in two languages for a single topic.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"Therefore, naively using the produced topics as “aligned” across languages is ill-advised.
",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
Our solution is to automatically identify aligned polylingual topics after learning by examining a topic’s distribution across code-switched documents.,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"Our metric relies on distributional properties of an inferred topic across the entire collection.
",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"To summarize, based on the model of Mimno et al. (2009) we will learn:
• For each topic, a language specific word distribution.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
•,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"For each (code-switched) token, a language.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
•,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"For each topic, an identification as to whether
the topic captures an alignment across languages.
",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
The first two goals are achieved by incorporating new hidden variables in the traditional polylingual topic model.,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
The third goal requires an automated post-processing step.,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
We call the resulting model Code-Switched LDA (csLDA).,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
The generative process is as follows:,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"• For each topic z ∈ T
• For each language l ∈",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
L,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
•,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"Draw word distribution φlz∼Dir(βl)
",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
• For each document d ∈ D: • Draw a topic distribution θd ∼ Dir(α) •,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
Draw a language distribution ψd∼Dir(γ),3 csLDA,[0],[0]
•,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
For each token,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
i ∈,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
d: • Draw a topic zi ∼ θd •,3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"Draw a language li ∼ ψd • Draw a word wi ∼ φlz For monolingual documents, we fix li to the LID tag for all tokens.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"Additionally, we use a single background distribution for each language to capture stopwords; a control variable π, which follows a Dirichlet distribution with prior parameterized by δ, is introduced to decide the choice between background words and topic words following (Chemudugunta et al., 2006)1.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
"We use asymmetric Dirichlet priors (Wallach et al., 2009), and let the optimization process learn the hyperparameters.",3 csLDA,[0],[0]
The graphical model is shown in Figure 2.,3 csLDA,[1.0],['The graphical model is shown in Figure 2.']
Inference for csLDA follows directly from LDA.,3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
A Gibbs sampler learns the word distributions φlz for each language and topic.,3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
We use a block Gibbs sampler to jointly sample topic and language variables for each token.,3.1 Inference,[1.0],['We use a block Gibbs sampler to jointly sample topic and language variables for each token.']
"As is customary, we collapse out φ, θ and ψ.",3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
"The sampling posterior is:
P (zi, li|w, z−i, l−i, α, β, γ) ∝",3.1 Inference,[0],[0]

"l,d −i is the number of tokens assigned to language l in document d (excluding current word wi), and these variables with superscripts or subscripts omitted are totals across all values for the variable.",3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
W is the number of words in the corpus.,3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
All counts omit words assigned to the background.,3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
"During sampling, words are first assigned to the background/topic distribution and then topic and language are sampled for nonbackground words.
",3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
"We optimize the hyperparameters α, β, γ and δ by interleaving sampling iterations with a NewtonRaphson update to obtain the MLE estimate for the hyperparameters.",3.1 Inference,[1.0],"['We optimize the hyperparameters α, β, γ and δ by interleaving sampling iterations with a NewtonRaphson update to obtain the MLE estimate for the hyperparameters.']"
"Taking α as an example, one step of the Newton-Raphson update is:
αnew = αold −H−1∂L ∂α
(2)
where H is the Hessian matrix and ∂L∂α is the gradient of the likelihood function with respect to the optimizing hyperparameter.",3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
We interleave 200 sampling iterations with one Newton-Raphson update.,3.1 Inference,[0],[0]
"We next identify learned topics (a set of related word-distributions) that truly represent an aligned topic across languages, as opposed to an unrelated set of distributions for which there is no supporting alignment evidence in the corpus.",3.2 Selecting Aligned Topics,[0],[0]
We begin by measuring how often each topic occurs in codeswitched documents.,3.2 Selecting Aligned Topics,[0],[0]
"If a topic never occurs in a code-switched document, then there can be no evidence to support alignment across languages.",3.2 Selecting Aligned Topics,[1.0],"['If a topic never occurs in a code-switched document, then there can be no evidence to support alignment across languages.']"
"For the topics that appear at least once in a codeswitched document, we estimate their probability
in the code-switched documents by a MAP estimate of θ.",3.2 Selecting Aligned Topics,[0],[0]
Topics appearing in at least one codeswitched document with probability greater than a threshold p are selected as candidates for true cross-language topics.,3.2 Selecting Aligned Topics,[0],[0]
"We used two datasets: a Sina Weibo ChineseEnglish corpus (Ling et al., 2013) and a SpanishEnglish Twitter corpus.
",4 Data,[0],[0]
"Weibo Ling et al. (2013) extracted over 1m Chinese-English parallel segments from Sina Weibo, which are code-switched messages.",4 Data,[0],[0]
"We randomly sampled 29,705 code-switched messages along with 42,116 Chinese and 42,116 English messages from the the same time frame.",4 Data,[0],[0]
We used these data for training.,4 Data,[0],[0]
"We then sampled an additional 2475 code-switched messages, 4221 English and 4211 Chinese messages as test data.
Olympics We collected tweets from July 27, 2012 to August 12, 2012, and identified 302,775 tweets about the Olympics based on related hashtags and keywords (e.g. olympics, #london2012, etc.)",4 Data,[0],[0]
We identified code-switched tweets using the Chromium Language Detector2.,4 Data,[0],[0]
This system provides the top three possible languages for a given document with confidence scores; we identify a tweet as code-switched if two predicted languages each have confidence greater than 33%.,4 Data,[0],[0]
"We then used the tagger of Lignos and Marcus (2013) to obtain token level LID tags, and only tweets with tokens in both Spanish and English are used as code-switched tweets.",4 Data,[0],[0]
In total we identified 822 Spanish-English code-switched tweets.,4 Data,[0],[0]
"We further expanded the mined tweets to full conversations, yielding 1055 Spanish-English codeswitched documents (including both tweets and conversations), along with 4007 English and 4421 Spanish tweets composes our data set.",4 Data,[1.0],"['We further expanded the mined tweets to full conversations, yielding 1055 Spanish-English codeswitched documents (including both tweets and conversations), along with 4007 English and 4421 Spanish tweets composes our data set.']"
We reserve 10% of the data for testing.,4 Data,[1.0],['We reserve 10% of the data for testing.']
We evaluated csLDA on the two datasets and evaluated each model using perplexity on held out data and human judgements.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"While our goal is to learn polylingual topics, we cannot compare to previous polylingual models since they require comparable data, which we lack.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Instead, we constructed a baseline from LDA run on the entire dataset (no

language information.)",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For each model, we measured the document completion perplexity (RosenZvi et al., 2004) on the held out data.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We experimented with different numbers of topics (T ).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Since csLDA duplicates topic distributions (T ×L) we used twice as many topics for LDA.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows test perplexity for varying T and perplexity for the best setting of csLDA (T =60) and LDA (T =120).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The table lists both monolingual and code-switched test data; csLDA improves over LDA in almost every case, and across all values of T .",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The background distribution (-bg) has mixed results for LDA, whereas for csLDA it shows consistent improvement.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Table 4 shows some csLDA topics.,5 Experiments,[1.0],['Table 4 shows some csLDA topics.']
"While there are some mistakes, overall the topics are coherent and aligned.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We use the available per-token LID system (Lignos and Marcus, 2013) for Spanish/English to justify csLDA’s ability to infer the hidden language variables.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We ran csLDA-bg with li set to the value provided by the LID system for codeswitched documents (csLDA-bg with LID), which gives csLDA high quality LID labels.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"While we see gains for the code-switched data, overall the results for csLDA-bg and csLDA-bg with LID are similar, suggesting that the model can operate effectively even without a supervised per-token LID system.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We evaluate topic alignment quality through a human judgements (Chang et al., 2009).",5.1 Human Evaluation,[1.0],"['We evaluate topic alignment quality through a human judgements (Chang et al., 2009).']"

LDA may learn comparable topics in different languages but gives no explicit alignments.,5.1 Human Evaluation,[1.0],['LDA may learn comparable topics in different languages but gives no explicit alignments.']

Language is assigned to a topic by taking the minimum KL.,5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For Weibo data, this was not effective since the vocabularies of each language are highly unbalanced.",5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Instead,
we manually labeled the topics by language.",5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
We then pair topics across languages using the cosine similarity of their co-occurrence statistics in codeswitched documents.,5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
Topic pairs with similarity above t are considered aligned topics.,5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
We also used a threshold p (§3.2) to select aligned topics in csLDA.,5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To ensure a fair comparison, we select the same number of aligned topics for LDA and csLDA.3.",5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We used the best performing setting: csLDA T =60, LDA T =120, which produced 12 alignments from Olympics and 28 from Weibo.

Using Mechanical Turk we collected multiple judgements per alignment.,5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For Spanish, we removed workers who disagreed with the majority more than 50% of the time (83 deletions), leaving 6.5 annotations for each alignment (85.47% inter-annotator agreement.)",5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For Chinese, since quality of general Chinese turkers is low (Pavlick et al., 2014)",5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
we invited specific workers and obtained 9.3 annotations per alignment (78.72% inter-annotator agreement.),5.1 Human Evaluation,[0],[0]
