1	42	Being highly analytic, English relies heavily on word order and closed-class function words like prepositions, determiners, and conjunctions.
3	23	Consider prepositions: they serve, for example, to convey place and time (We met at/in/outside the restaurant for/after an hour), to express configurational relationships like quantity, possession, part/whole, and membership (the coats of dozens of children in the class), and to indicate semantic roles in argument structure (Grandma cooked dinner for the children ∗nathan.schneider@georgetown.edu vs. Grandma cooked the children for dinner).
7	23	This work represents a new attempt to strike that balance.
8	38	Building on prior work, we argue for an approach to describing English preposition and possessive semantics with broad coverage.
9	99	Given the semantic overlap between prepositions and possessives (the hood of the car vs. the car’s hood or its hood), we analyze them using the same inventory of semantic labels.1 Our contributions include: • a new hierarchical inventory (“SNACS”) of 50 supersense classes, extensively documented in guidelines for English (§3); • a gold-standard corpus with comprehensive annotations: all types and tokens of prepositions and possessives are disambiguated (§4; example sentences appear in figure 1); • an interannotator agreement study that shows the scheme is reliable and generalizes across genres—and for the first time demonstrating empirically that the lexical semantics of a preposition can sometimes be detached from the PP’s semantic role (§5); • disambiguation experiments with two supervised classification architectures to establish the difficulty of the task (§6).
10	20	Studies of preposition semantics in linguistics and cognitive science have generally focused on the domains of space and time (e.g., Herskovits, 1986; Bowerman and Choi, 2001; Regier, 1996; Khetarpal et al., 2009; Xu and Kemp, 2010; Zwarts and Winter, 2000) or on motivated polysemy structures that cover additional meanings beyond core spatial senses (Brugman, 1981; Lakoff, 1987; Tyler and Evans, 2003; Lindstromberg, 2010).
11	49	Possessive constructions can likewise denote a number of semantic relations, and various factors—including semantics—influence whether attributive possession in English will be expressed with of, or with ’s and possessive pronouns (the ‘genitive alternation’; Taylor, 1996; Nikiforidou, 1991; Rosenbach, 2002; Heine, 2006; Wolk et al., 2013; Shih et al., 2015).
12	85	Corpus-based computational work on semantic disambiguation specifically of prepositions and possessives2 falls into two categories: the lexicographic/word sense disambiguation approach (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005, 2007; Litkowski, 2014; Ye and Baldwin, 2007; Saint-Dizier, 2006; Dahlmeier et al., 2009; Tratz and Hovy, 2009; Hovy et al., 2010, 2011; Tratz and Hovy, 2013), and the semantic class approach (Moldovan et al., 2004; Badulescu and Moldovan, 2009; O’Hara and Wiebe, 2009; Srikumar and Roth, 2011, 2013; Schneider et al., 2015, 2016; Hwang et al., 2017, see also Müller et al., 2012 for German).
13	30	The lexicographic approach can capture finer-grained meaning distinctions, at a risk of relying upon idiosyncratic and potentially incomplete dictionary definitions.
29	33	Apart from canonical prepositions and possessives, there are many lexically and semantically overlapping closed-class items which are sometimes classified as other parts of speech, such as adverbs, particles, and subordinating conjunctions.
44	20	SNACS has 50 supersenses at 4 levels of depth; the previous hierarchy had 75 supersenses at 7 levels.
48	26	CONFIGURATION mainly encompasses non-spatiotemporal relations holding between entities, such as quantity, possession, and part/whole.
63	26	is a perfectly good way to ask a question that could be answered by the PP.
68	30	Instead, Hwang et al. (2017) suggest a construal analysis in which the lexical semantic contribution, or henceforth the function, of the preposition itself may be distinct from the semantic role or relation mediated by the preposition in a given sentence, called the scene role.
79	43	Figure 1 shows some real examples from our corpus.
80	26	We apply the construal analysis in SNACS annotation of our corpus to test its feasibility.
82	32	We applied the SNACS annotation scheme (§3) to prepositions and possessives in the STREUSLE corpus (§2), a collection of online consumer reviews taken from the English Web Treebank (Bies et al., 2012).
87	19	Three labels never appear in the annotated corpus: TEMPORAL from the CIRCUMSTANCE hierarchy, and PARTICIPANT and CONFIGURATION which are both the highest supersense in their respective hierarchies.
90	76	This reflects our view that prepositions primarily capture circumstantial notions such as space and time, but have been extended to cover other semantic relations.10
142	36	Our second classifier is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) stacked on top of a BiLSTM.
155	28	The main difference is their use of unlabeled multilingual datasets to improve prediction by exploiting the differences in preposition ambiguities across languages.
158	26	Table 5 reports the disambiguation performance of both classifiers with gold (left) and automatic target identification (right).
174	79	This mirrors a similar effect in the interannotator agreement scores (see §5), and may be due to the reduced ambiguity of functions compared to roles (as attested by the baseline’s higher accuracy for functions than roles), and by the more literal nature of function labels, as opposed to role labels that often require more context to determine.
176	21	In the auto ID/auto syntax condition, the worse target ID performance with automatic parses (noted above) contributes to lower classification scores.
179	21	Table 6 shows this for the feature-rich classifier for different depths, with depth-1 representing the coarsening of the labels into the 3 root labels.
182	33	Examining the most frequent confusions of both models, we observe that LOCUS is overpredicted (which makes sense as it is most frequent overall), and SOCIALROLE–ORGROLE and GESTALT– POSSESSOR are often confused (they are close in the hierarchy: one inherits from the other).
183	107	This paper introduced a new approach to comprehensive analysis of the semantics of prepositions and possessives in English, backed by a thoroughly documented hierarchy and annotated corpus.
184	284	We found good interannotator agreement and provided initial supervised disambiguation results.
185	150	We expect that future work will develop methods to scale the annotation process beyond requiring highly trained experts; bring this scheme to bear on other languages; and investigate the relationship of our scheme to more structured semantic representations, which could lead to more robust models.
