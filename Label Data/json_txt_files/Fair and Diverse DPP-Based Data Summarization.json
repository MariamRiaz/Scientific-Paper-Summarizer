Introduction", "text": "A problem facing many services \u2013 from search engines and news feeds to machine learning \u2013 is data summarization: how can one select a small but representative, i.e., diverse, subset from a large dataset. For instance, Google Images outputs a small subset of images from its enormous dataset given a user query. Similarly, in training a learning algorithm one may be required to choose a subset of data points to train on as training on the entire dataset may be costly. However, data summarization algorithms prevalent in the online world have been recently shown to be biased with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, race or ethnicity. For instance, a recent study found evidence of systematic\n1E\u0301cole Polytechnique Fe\u0301de\u0301rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland 2Microsoft Research, India 3UC Berkeley.

Concretely, the above work studied the output of Google Images for various search terms involving occupations and found, e.g., that for the search term \u201cCEO\u201d, the percentage of women in top 100 results was 11%, significantly lower than the ground truth of 27%. Through studies on human subjects, they also found that such misrepresentations have the power to influence people\u2019s perception about reality. Beyond humans, since data summaries are used to train algorithms, there is a danger that these biases in the data might be passed on to the algorithms that use them; a phenomena that is being revealed more and more in automated data-driven processes in education, recruitment, banking, and judiciary systems, see (O\u2019Neil, 2016).\nA robust and widely deployed method for data summarization is to associate a diversity score to each subset and select a subset with probability proportional to this score; see (Hesabi et al., 2015). This paper focuses on a concrete geometric measure of diversity of a subset S of a dataset {vx}x\u2208X of vectors \u2013 the determinantal measure denoted by G(S) (Kulesza & Taskar, 2012); and the resulting probability distribution is called a determinantal point process (DPP). G(S) generalizes the correlation measure for two vectors to multiple vectors and, intuitively, the larger G(S), the more diverse is S in the feature space. Among benefits of G(\u00b7) are its overall simplicity, wide applicability \u2013 not depending on combinatorial properties of the data, and efficient computability. A potential downside might be the additional effort required in modeling, i.e., to represent the data in a suitable vector form so that the geometry of the dataset indeed corresponds to diversity.\nDespite the well-acknowledged ability of DPPs to produce diverse subsets, unfortunately, there seems to be no obvious way to ensure that this also guarantees fairness in the DPP samples in the form of appropriate representation of sensitive attributes in the subset selected. Partially, this is due to the fact that fairness could mean different things in different contexts. For instance, consider a dataset in which each data point has a gender. One notion of fairness, useful in ensuring that the ground truth does not get distorted, is proportional representation: i.e., the distribution of sensitive characteristics in the output set should be identical to that of the input dataset (Kay et al., 2015). Another notion of fairness, argued to be necesseary to reverse the effect of\nhistorical biases (Koriyama et al., 2013), could be equal representation \u2013 the representation of sensitive characteristics should be equal independent of the ratio in the input dataset. While these measures of fairness have natural generalizations to the case when the number of sensitive types is more than two, and can be refined in several ways, one thing remains common: they all operate in the combinatorial space of sensitive attributes of the data points. Simple examples (see, e.g., Figure 1 in the Supplementary File) show that, in certain settings, geometric diversity does not imply fairness and vice-versa; however, there seems to be no intrinsic barrier in attaining both.\nWe initiate a rigorous study of the problem of incorporating fairness with respect to sensitive attributes of data in DPPbased sampling for data summarization. Our contributions are: A framework that can incorporate a wide class of notions of fairness with respect to disjoint sensitive attributes and, conditioned on being fair in the specified sense, outputs subsets where the probability of a set is still proportional to G()\u0307. In particular, we model the problem as sampling from a partition DPP \u2013 the parts correspond to different sensitive attributes and the goal is to select a specified number of points from each. Unfortunately, the problem of sampling from partition DPPs has been recently shown to be intractable in a strong sense (Celis et al., 2017) and the question of designing fast algorithms for it, at the expense of being approximate, has been open. Our main technical result is a linear time algorithm (see Section 3.1) to sample from partition DPPs that is guaranteed to output samples from close to the DPP distribution under a natural condition on the data (see Definition 4). We prove that random data matrices satisfy this condition in Section 3.3. We run our algorithm on the Adult dataset (Blake & Merz, 1998) and a curated image dataset with various parameter settings and observe a marked improvement in fairness without compromising geometric diversity by much. A theoretical justification of this low price of fairness is provided in Section 4; while there have been few works on controlling fairness, ours is the first to give a rigorous, quantitative price of fairness guarantee in any setting. Overall, our work gives a general and rigorous algorithmic solution to the problem of controlling bias in DPP-based sampling algorithms for data summarization while maximizing diversity.\nRelated Work. There are several data pre-processing approaches to reduce bias in training data. For example, in (Kamiran & Calders, 2012) or (He & Garcia, 2009), bias is removed from training data by over- or under-sampling from the dataset with appropriately defined cardinality constraints on the parts of a partition. The sampling approach used is often either uniform or preferential (according to a problem-dependent ranking). We show that sampling using partition-DPPs has better results in ensuring diversity of the sampled subset than any such sampling method.\nDPP-based sampling has been deployed for many data summarization tasks including text and images (Kulesza & Taskar, 2011), videos (Gong et al., 2014), documents (Lin & Bilmes, 2012), recommendation systems (Zhou et al., 2010), and sensors (Krause et al., 2008); and the study of DPPs with additional budget or resource constraints is of importance. While for unconstrained DPPs there are efficient algorithms to sample (Hough et al., 2006), the problem of sampling from constrained DPPs is intractable; see (Celis et al., 2017), where pseudopolynomial time algorithms for partition DPPs are presented. There is also work on approximate MCMC algorithms for sampling from various discrete point processes (see (Rebeschini & Karbasi, 2015; Anari et al., 2016) and the references therein), and algorithms that are efficient for constrained DPPs under certain restrictions on the data matrix and constraints (see (Li et al., 2016) and the references therein). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first algorithm for constrained DPPs that is near-linear time. Our algorithm is a greedy, approximate algorithm, and can be considered an extension of a similar algorithm for unconstrained DPPs given by (Deshpande & Vempala, 2006). Finally, our work contributes towards an ongoing effort to measure, understand and incorporate fairness (e.g., see (Barocas & Selbst, 2015; Caliskan et al., 2017; Dwork et al., 2012; Zafar et al., 2017)) in fundamental algorithmic problems, including ranking (Celis et al., 2018b), voting (Celis et al., 2018a), and personalization (Celis & Vishnoi, 2017)."}, {"heading": "2. Our Model", "text": "In this section we present the formal notions, model and other theoretical constructs studied in this paper. X will denote the dataset and we let m denote its size. We assume that for each x \u2208 X , we are given a (feature) vector vx \u2208 Rn, where n \u2264 m is the dimension of the data. Let V denote the m \u00d7 n matrix whose rows correspond to the vectors vx for x \u2208 X . For a set S \u2286 X , we use VS to denote the submatrix of V that is obtained by picking the rows of V corresponding to the elements of S. We can now describe geometric diversity formally.\nDefinition 1. (Geometric Diversity) Given a dataset X and the corresponding feature vectors V \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, the geometric diversity of a subset S \u2286 X is defined as G(S) := det ( VSV > S ) , which is the squared volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the rows of VS .\nThis volume generalizes the correlation measure for two vectors to multiple vectors and, intuitively, the larger the volume, the more diverse is S in the feature space; see\nFigure 2 in the Supplementary File for an illustration. Geometric diversity gives rise to the following distribution on subsets known as a determinantal point process (DPP).\nDefinition 2. (DPPs and k-DPPs) Given a dataset X and the corresponding feature vectors V \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, the DPP is a distribution over subsets S \u2286 X such that the probability\nP[S] \u221d det ( VSV > S ) . The induced probability distribution over k-sized subsets is called k-DPP.\nA characteristic of a DPP measure is that the inclusion of one item makes including other similar items less likely. Consequently, DPPs assign greater probability to subsets of points that are diverse; for example, a DPP prefers search results that cover multiple aspects of a user\u2019s query, rather than the most popular one.\nOur Algorithmic Framework: We are given a dataset X along with corresponding feature vectors V \u2208 Rm\u00d7n and a positive number k \u2264 m that denotes the size of the subset or summary that needs to be generated. The dataset X is partitioned into p disjoint classes X1 \u222aX2 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aXp, each corresponding to a sensitive class. A key feature of our model is that we do not fix one notion of fairness; rather, we allow for the specification of fairness constraints with respect to these sensitive classes. Formally, we do this by taking as input p natural numbers (k1, k2, . . . , kp) such that \u2211p j=1 kj = k is the sample size. These numbers give rise to a fair family of allowed subsets defined to be B := {S \u2286 X : |S \u2229 Xj | = kj for all j = 1, 2, . . . , p}. By setting (k1, . . . , kp) appropriately, the user can ensure their desired notion of fairness. For example, if the dataset hasmi items with the i-th sensitive attribute, then we can set ki := kmi/m to obtain proportional representation. Similarly, equal representation can be implemented by setting ki = k/p for all i.\nThe fair data summarization problem is to sample from a distribution that is supported on B. However, there could be many such distributions; we pick one that is \u201cclosest\u201d to the to the k-DPP described by V . We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between distributions q and q\u0303 defined as DKL(q||q\u0303) := \u2211 S qS log qS q\u0303S .1 The following lemma characterizes the distribution supported on B that has the least KL-divergence to a given distribution (see Appendix B.1 in the Supplementary File for the proof).\nLemma 1. Given a distribution q\u0303 with support set C, let B \u2286 C and q be any distribution on B. Then the optimal value of minqDKL(q||q\u0303) is achieved by the distribution q?, such that q?S \u221d q\u0303S , for S \u2208 B and 0 otherwise. Thus, the distribution above can be thought of as the most diverse while being fair; we call it partition DPP, or P -DPP.\nDefinition 3. (P -DPP) Given a dataset X , the corresponding feature vectors V \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, a partition X = X1 \u222a X2 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Xp into p parts, and natural numbers k1, . . . , kp, P -DPP defines a distribution q? over subsets S \u2286 X of size k = \u2211p i=1 ki such that for all S \u2208 B we\n1Note that when there are only two parts, one can recover the percentages of elements from each part from the KL-distance.

Correspondingly, the flexibility that our framework provides in specifying the fairness constraints comes at a computational cost. In this paper, we give a fast, approximate sampling algorithm for P -DPPs."}, {"heading": "3. Our Algorithm", "text": "Notions of Volume and Projection. Let us recall the interpretation of determinants in terms of volumes. For S \u2286 X , VS is the set of vectors {vx}x\u2208S . If the vectors in S are pairwise orthogonal, then the matrix VSV >S is diagonal with entries {\u2016vx\u20162}x\u2208S on the diagonal and, hence, det(VSV > S ) = \u220f x\u2208S \u2016vx\u2016\n2. In the general case, the determinant is not simply the (squared) product of the norms of vectors, however a similar formula still holds. Let H \u2286 Rn be any linear subspace and H\u22a5 be its orthogonal complement, i.e., H\u22a5 := {y \u2208 Rn | \u3008x, y\u3009 = 0 for all x \u2208 H}. Let \u03a0H : Rn \u2192 Rn be the orthogonal projection operator on the subspace H\u22a5, i.e., whenever w \u2208 Rn decomposes as w1+w2 forw1 \u2208 H andw2 \u2208 H\u22a5, then \u03a0H(w) = w2. By a slight abuse of notation, we also denote by \u03a0v the operator that projects a vector to another that is orthogonal to a given vector v \u2208 Rn, i.e., \u03a0v(w) := w \u2212 \u3008w, v\u3009 / \u2016v\u20162 .\nThe following lemma is a simple generalization of the formula derived above for orthogonal families of vectors and inspires our algorithm for P -DPPs. The proof of this lemma is presented in Section B.3 in the Supplementary File. Lemma 2 (Determinant Volume Lemma). Let w1, . . . , wk \u2208 Rn be the rows of a matrix W \u2208 Rk\u00d7n, then det(WW>) = \u220fk i=1 \u2016\u03a0Hiwi\u2016 2 , whereHi is the subspace spanned by {w1, . . . , wi\u22121} for all i = 1, 2, . . . , k."}, {"heading": "3.1. Our Sample and Project Algorithm", "text": "Before we describe our algorithms for sampling from P - DPPs, it is instructive to consider the special case of k-DPPs itself and the simple \u201corthogonal\u201d scenario \u2013 where all the vectors vx, for x \u2208 X , are pairwise orthogonal. In such a case, there is a simple iterative algorithm: sample x \u2208 X with probability \u221d \u2016vx\u20162, then add x to S and remove x from X; repeat until |S| = k. It is intuitively clear, and not hard to prove, that the final probability of obtaining a given set S as a sample is proportional to \u220f x\u2208S \u2016vx\u2016 2 = det(VSV > S ) and, hence, recovers the k-DPP exactly.\nIn case of P -DPPs where all the vectors are pairwise orthogonal, and we need to sample ki vectors from partition Xi, we can sample the required number of elements from each partition independently using the procedure in the previous paragraph. The orthogonality of the vectors and the disjointness of the parts implies that this sampling procedure gives the right probability distribution.\nAlgorithm 1 Sample-And-Project 1: Input: V, (X1, .., Xp), (k1, .., kp) 2: S \u2190 \u2205 3: k \u2190 k1 + k2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ kp 4: Let wx := vx for all x \u2208 X 5: while |S| < k do 6: Pick any2 i \u2208 {1, . . . , p} such that |S \u2229Xi| < ki 7: Define q \u2208 RXi by qx := \u2016wx\u20162 for x \u2208 Xi 8: Sample x\u0303 \u2208 Xi from distribution { qx\u2211\ny\u2208Xi qy } x\u2208Xi\n9: S \u2190 S \u222a {x\u0303} 10: Let v := wx\u0303 11: For all x \u2208 X , set wx := \u03a0v(wx) 12: end while However, when the vectors vx are no longer pairwise orthogonal, the above heuristic can fail miserably. This is where we invoke Lemma 2. It suggests the following strategy: once we select a vector, then we should orthogonalize all the remaining vectors with respect to it before repeating the sampling procedure. For the case of k-DPPs, it can be shown that this heuristic outputs a set S with probability no more than k! times its desired probability (Deshpande & Vempala, 2006). The k! term is primarily because the k vectors can be chosen in any of the k! orders. Taking this simple heuristic as a starting point and incorporating an additional idea to deal with partition constraints, we arrive at our Sample and Project algorithm \u2013 see Algorithm 1.\nGiven that we have made several simplifications and informal \u201cjumps\u201d when deriving the algorithm one cannot expect that the distribution over sets S produced by Algorithm 1 to be exactly the same as P -DPP. Later in this section we give evidence that in fact the distribution output by the \u201cSample and Project\u201d heuristic can be formally related to the P -DPP distribution, and hence the constructed algorithm is provably an approximation to a P -DPP. However, we first note an attractive feature of this algorithm \u2013 it is fast and practical. For a V \u2208 Rm\u00d7n matrix and k = \u2211p i=1 ki, Algorithm 1 can be implemented in O(mnk) time.\nNote that the size of the data for this problem is already \u0398(mn), hence, the algorithm does only linear work per sampled point. For P -DPPs there is only one known exact algorithm which samples in time mO(p), which is polynomial only when p = O(1) (Celis et al., 2017).\nAnother possible approach for sampling from DPPs is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It was proved in (Anari et al., 2016) that Markov Chains can be used to sample from k-DPPs in time roughly O\u0303(mk4 + mn2) given a \u201cwarm start\u201d, i.e., a set S0 of significant probability. This approach does not extend to P -DPPs \u2013 indeed in (Anari et al., 2016) the underlying probability distribution is required to be Strongly Rayleigh, a property which holds for k-DPPs, but fails for P -DPPs whenever the number of parts is at least\ntwo. One can still formulate an analogous MCMC algorithm for the case of P -DPPs \u2013 it fails on specially crafted \u201cbad instances\u201d but seems to perform well on real world data. However, even ignoring the lack of provable guarantees for this algorithm, it does not seem possible to reduce its running time below O(mk4 +mn2), which significantly limits its practical applicability."}, {"heading": "3.2. Provable Guarantees for Our Algorithm", "text": "We now present a theorem which connects the output distribution of Algorithm 1 to the corresponding P -DPP. To establish such a guarantee we require the following assumption on the singular values of the matrices VXi .\nDefinition 4 (\u03b2-balance).

A more concrete geometric way to think about this condition is as follows: if one thinks of the positive semidefinite matrix V >V \u2208 Rn\u00d7n as representing an ellipsoid in Rn whose axes are the singular values, then the \u03b2-balance condition essentially says that the ellipsoids corresponding to each of the partitions are a \u03b2-approximation to that of V (see Figure 4 in the Supplementary File).\nImportantly, Algorithm 1 never outputs a set S /\u2208 B, hence the only way its output distribution could significantly differ from the P -DPP would be if certain sets S \u2208 B appeared in the output with larger probabilities than specified by the P -DPP. Our main theoretical result for Sample and Project is that for \u03b2-balanced instances we can control the scale at which such a violation can happen.\nTheorem 1 (Approximation Guarantee).

Lemma 4. Given a \u03b2-balanced partition, Algorithm 1 returns a set S such that det(VSV >S ) is non-zero with probability one.\nProof of Theorem 1. Let \u03c0 be the random variable representing the ordered output of the algorithm. Suppose that the algorithm outputs the set S = {x1, . . . , xk}. Since the partition X1, . . . , Xp is \u03b2-balanced with respect to V , by Lemma 4 the algorithm will always output a set which has non-zero determinant value, i.e, det(VSV >S ) 6= 0. Consider any ordering of the set S, say, \u03c4 := (x1, . . . , xk). Let Hj \u2286 Rn denote the linear subspace spanned by the vectors corresponding to the first j \u2212 1 elements, i.e., {vx1 , . . . , vxj\u22121}. We also define a mapping f : X \u2192 {1, . . . , p} such that f(x) = i if x \u2208 Xi. In the first iteration say we choose partition X1. Then the algorithm will sample an element from X1 with probability proportional to the squared norm of the vector. After (j \u2212 1) iterations wx will be the orthogonal projection of vx onto the subspace orthogonal to span{vx1 , vx2 , . . . , vxj\u22121}. This is a consequence of the fact that (\u03a0vx1 \u03a0vx1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03a0vxj\u22121 ) = \u03a0Hj .\nHence in the (j \u2212 1)-th iteration, wx = \u03a0Hj (vx) for all x \u2208 X . Therefore, the probability that the sequence \u03c4 is the output of the algorithm is\nP(\u03c0 = \u03c4) = k\u220f j=1 \u2225\u2225\u03a0Hj (vxj )\u2225\u22252\u2211 x\u2208Xf(xj)\n\u2225\u2225\u03a0Hj (vx)\u2225\u22252 .

Price of Fairness", "text": "In this section we present conditions under which the k-DPP and P -DPP distributions are close to each other. Note that the support of a P -DPP is a subset of the support of the corresponding k-DPP. Thus, a natural definition of the price of fairness is the KL-divergence between them. Definition 5 (Price of Fairness). Given a matrix V \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, partitions X1, . . . , Xp and integers k1, . . . , kp, let k = k1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + kp.

Such a notion of low effective rank appears frequently in the machine learning literature (Roy & Vetterli, 2007; Drineas et al., 1999). We prove the following theorem that asserts that if the \u03b4drop condition is satisfied, then we can be sure that most of the probability mass is concentrated on subsets which satisfy partition constraints. In such a case, sampling a k sized subset using any k-DPP algorithm will output a subset which satisfies partition constraints with high probability.

We gathered a collection of images curated using Google image search as follows: Four search terms were used: (a) \u201cScientist Male\u201d, (b) \u201cScientist Female\u201d, (c) \u201cPainter Male\u201d, and (d) \u201cPainter Female\u201d (Imagedataset).\nFollowing (Kulesza & Taskar, 2011), each image was processed with the vlfeat toolbox to obtain sets of 128- dimensional SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999; Vedaldi & Fulkerson, 2008). All such descriptors are collected in a single set and subsampled to roughly 10% of its total size. The resulting set of \u2248 104 descriptors was clustered using the k-means algorithm where k = 128 is the number of means. The feature vector for an image is the normalized histogram of the nearest clusters to the descriptors in the image.\nEmpirical Results on the Biased Datasets. Our goal is to understand how the bias in the underlying dataset can affect the performance of the different sampling distributions with\nrespect to fairness and geometric diversity. We include all female (b and d) images, but vary how many of the male images (a and c) appear in the dataset in order to create biased sets that have between 10% to 50% male images. The male images are selected uniformly at random from the set of all male scientists and male artists for each repetition of the simulation. We sample 40 images from each biased dataset; roughly the number that fits on the first page of an image search result. We conduct 200 repetitions. We place fairness constraints so that P -DPP and ki-DPP select exactly 50% of their samples from the male (a and c) images and female (b and d) images, regardless of the bias in the underlying dataset. Note that we do not enforce constraints across scientist (a and b) images and artist (c and d) images, but measure the unfariness Dun(\u00b7) with respect to all four attributes.\nResults. With respect to Dun(\u00b7), P -DPP significantly outperforms k-DPP, and UNIF (paired one-sided t-tests, p < 0.05), see Figure 1. As expected, the bias in the underlying dataset can dramatically affect the fairness of UNIF and k-DPP as neither approach is designed to correct for such biases. However, P -DPP and ki-DPP both enforce fairness constraints; note that this is despite the fact that the sampling was only equal with respect to gender and not profession. The latter does not appear to affect the outcome here.\nWith respect to the diversity G(\u00b7), P -DPP has significantly higher G(\u00b7) than UNIF and ki-DPP (paired one-sided ttests, p < 0.05). Moreover, P -DPP performs comparatively to k-DPP; the mean diversity of k-DPP is higher, but not significantly so. Thus, we observe that, when the underlying data is biased, there is a tradeoff between Dun(\u00b7) (for which P -DPP performs best) and G(\u00b7) (for which k-DPP performs best); however the differences in geometric diversity are negligible while differences in unfairness can be very large."}, {"heading": "5.3. Empirical Results on Real-World Dataset", "text": "The Adult Dataset. The Adult income dataset (Blake & Merz, 1998) consists of roughly 45000 records of subjects each with 14 features such as age, ethnicity, education and a binary label indicating whether a subject\u2019s incomes is above or below 50K USD.3 This dataset has been widely studied in the context of fairness (see, (Yang & Stoyanovich, 2017; Zafar et al., 2017; Zemel et al., 2013; Zadrozny, 2004)).\nIn preprocessing the data we filter out incomplete entries, and from the remaining ones we pick a random subset of 5000 records for our simulations. We vectorize the data as follows: Categorical fields (with a small number of possible values) we turn into sets of binary fields. As the dimension n of such feature vectors is quite small \u2013 50 \u2013 the DPP framework allows sampling sets of cardinality at most k \u2264 50. For this reason we enrich the feature vectors in a standard way \u2013 by adding pairwise products of all existing features as separate ones \u2013 this, after removing redundant columns, yields feature vectors of dimension 992.\nEmpirical Results on Equal and Proportional Representation. We conduct our simulations across either gender or ethnicity as the sensitive attribute. For the former, we use the gender categories provided in the dataset; all entries were labeled either male (68.3%) or female (31.7%). For the latter, we use the ethnicity categories provided in the dataset; we consider the partition Caucasian (85.7%) and non-Caucasian (14.3%).\nIn addition to the algorithms mentioned above, we report the performance of an additional benchmark ki-UNIF, which selects a uniformly random subset of size ki fromXi. In our subsampling, we consider both equal representation, where\n3Data downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci. edu/ml/datasets/adult.\neach attribute makes up of 50% of the selected points, and proportional representation, where each attribute is represented with the same ratio as in the original population.\nResults. We observe that P -DPP has the highest diversity out of all constrained sampling methods regardless of the proportion of representation or sensitive attribute; see Table 1. Surprisingly, the diversity of P -DPP matches that of the unconstrained k-DPP for Gender under proportional representation and for Ethnicity under equal representation. In the other two settings \u2013 Gender under equal representation and Ethnicity under proportional representation \u2013 the P - DPP score is lower than that of k-DPP, but minimally so, and outperforms ki-DPP by several standard deviations. We note that ki-UNIF, although it has very poor geometric diversity as a whole, performs better under equal representation than it does under proportional representation. This fact suggests that there could be value in selecting sensitive attributes equally beyond the consideration of fairness. The fact that P -DPP performs so well, especially when significantly changing the distribution of sensitive attributes (e.g., for ethnicity, from 14.3% non-Caucasian to 50% nonCaucasian), is quite surprising. Overall, it appears that one can support very dramatic changes to the underlying distributions of attributes with minimal or even zero loss to geometric diversity by using our P -DPP algorithm."}, {"heading": "5.4. Empirical Results on the Price of Fairness", "text": "We look at the effect of the scaling of singular values, suggested by Theorem 3, on the sampled subsets of our Algorithm. In this simulation we take an instance of random vectors and use different sampling methods to sample a subset from the dataset, and report the Dun(\u00b7) and logG(\u00b7) value of the sampled subset. Following this, we scale the tail singular values of the partition matrices by \u03b4 = O(1/n) and again report the Dun(\u00b7) and logG(\u00b7) values.\nWe also present a heuristic approach, Scale-And-Sample, for constrained sampling which will use any k-DPP algorithm as a sub-routine. The algorithm is simple. For each VXi , scale the smallest (n \u2212 ki) singular values by 1/n. Then sample a \u2211p i=1 ki sized subset using any k-DPP algorithm.\nResults. The results are presented in Table 2. It can be seen that after scaling the tail singular values of the partition matrices, the mean Dun(\u00b7) value for k-DPP is very low, and resembles closely the constrained sampling case. We also note that the Scale-And-Sample approach to constrained sampling suggested earlier performs very well. The mean relative unfairness measure Dun(\u00b7) is almost zero. Furthermore, the value of the geometric diversity parameter logG(\u00b7) is also similar to unscaled P -DPP."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper we initiated the study of fair and diverse DPPbased sampling for data summarization. We provide a novel and fast algorithm that can sample from a DPP that satisfy fairness constraints based on the desired proportion of samples with a given attribute. Our algorithm gives provably good guarantees when the data matrix satisfies a natural \u03b2-balance property. We prove that a large class of datasets satisfy the \u03b2-balance condition. We define a notion of price of fairness, the KL-divergence between the fairness constrained distribution and the unconstrained distribution and theoretically show that, when the data satisfies reasonable properties, this price would be low. We further show in silico that adding fairness constraints results in minimal loss to diversity, even when the underlying dataset is very biased, or when the proportion of attributes is changed significantly.\nSeveral challenging problems remain from a technical standpoint; naturally, a first question would be whether the theorems can be improved either by attaining better approximation guarantees, or by weakening the necessary conditions. Extending these results to arbitrary group structures (as opposed to partitions) would be very relevant, but appears to be significantly more challenging.\nFrom a practical point of view, it remains to be seen what effect de-biasing a sampler has on the end result of an ML algorithm (e.g., classification), both on its accuracy and on the output bias. Indeed, this P -DPP model can be used to pre-process the training data by taking a fair subsample; evaluating the performance of ML algorithms in this regard would be an interesting direction for future research."}], "year": 2018, "references": [{"title": "Monte carlo markov chain algorithms for sampling strongly rayleigh distributions and determinantal point processes", "authors": ["N.
