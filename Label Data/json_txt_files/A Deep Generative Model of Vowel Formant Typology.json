The field of linguistic typology seeks to investigate, describe and quantify the axes along which languages vary. One facet of language that has been the subject of heavy investigation is the nature of vowel inventories, i.e., which vowels a language contains. It is a cross-linguistic universal that all spoken languages have vowels (Gordon, 2016), and the underlying principles guiding vowel selection are understood: vowels must be both easily recognizable and well-dispersed (Schwartz et al., 2005). In this work, we offer a more formal treatment of the subject, deriving a generative probability model of vowel inventory typology. Our work builds on (Cotterell and Eisner, 2017) by investigating not just discrete IPA inventories but the cross-linguistic variation in acoustic formants.\nThe philosophy behind our approach is that linguistic typology should be treated probabilistically\nand its goal should be the construction of a universal prior over potential languages. A probabilistic approach does not rule out linguistic systems completely (as long as one\u2019s theoretical formalism can describe them at all), but it can position phenomena on a scale from very common to very improbable. Probabilistic modeling also provides a discipline for drawing conclusions from sparse data. While we know of over 7000 human languages, we have some sort of linguistic analysis for only 2300 of them (Comrie et al., 2013), and the dataset used in this paper (Becker-Kristal, 2010) provides simple vowel data for fewer than 250 languages.\nFormants are the resonant frequencies of the human vocal tract during the production of speech sounds. We propose a Bayesian generative model of vowel inventories, where each language\u2019s inventory is a finite subset of acoustic vowels represented as points (F1, F2) \u2208 R2. We deploy tools from the neural-network and point-process literatures and experiment on a dataset with 233 distinct languages. We show that our most complicated model outperforms simpler models."}, {"heading": "2 Acoustic Phonetics and Formants", "text": "Much of human communication takes place through speech: one conversant emits a sound wave to be comprehended by a second. In this work, we consider the nature of the portions of such sound waves that correspond to vowels. We briefly review the relevant bits of acoustic phonetics so as to give an overview of the data we are actually modeling and develop our notation.\nThe anatomy of a sound wave. The sound wave that carries spoken language is a function from time to amplitude, describing sound pressure variation in the air. To distinguish vowels, it is helpful to transform this function into a spectrogram (Fig. 1) by using a short-time Fourier transform\n37\n0 Hz\n1000 Hz\n2000 Hz\n3000 Hz\n4000 Hz\n5000 Hz /i/ /u/ /\u0251/\nFigure 1: Example spectrogram of the three English vowels: /i/, /u/ and /A/. The x-axis is time and y-axis is frequency. The first two formants F1 and F2 are marked in with arrows for each vowel. The figure was made with Praat (Boersma et al., 2002).\n(Deng and O\u2019Shaughnessy, 2003, Chapter 1) to decompose each short interval of the wave function into a weighted sum of sinusoidal waves of different frequencies (measured in Hz). At each interval, the variable darkness of the spectrogram indicates the weights of the different frequencies. In phonetic analysis, a common quantity to consider is a formant\u2014a local maximum of the (smoothed) frequency spectrum. The fundamental frequency F0 determines the pitch of the sound. The formants F1 and F2 determine the quality of the vowel.\nTwo is all you need (and what we left out). In terms of vowel recognition, it is widely speculated that humans rely almost exclusively on the first two formants of the sound wave (Ladefoged, 2001, Chapter 5). The two-formant assumption breaks down in edge cases: e.g., the third formant F3 helps to distinguish the roundness of the vowel (Ladefoged, 2001, Chapter 5). Other non-formant features may also play a role. For example, in tonal languages, the same vowel may be realized with different tones (which are signaled using F0): Mandarin Chinese makes a distinction between ma\u030c (horse) and ma\u0301 (hemp) without modifying the quality of the vowel /a/. Other features, such as creaky voice, can play a role in distinguishing phonemes. We do not explicitly model any of these aspects of vowel space, limiting ourselves to (F1, F2) as in previous work (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972). However, it would be easy to extend all the models we will propose here to incorporate such information, given appropriate datasets."}, {"heading": "3 The Phonology of Vowel Systems", "text": "The vowel inventories of the world\u2019s languages display clear structure and appear to obey several underlying principles. The most prevalent of these\nprinciples are focalization and dispersion.\nFocalization. The notion of focalization grew out of quantal vowel theory (Stevens, 1989). Quantal vowels are those that are phonetically \u201cbetter\u201d than others. They tend to display certain properties, e.g., the formants tend to be closer together (Stevens, 1987). Cross-linguistically, quantal vowels are the most frequently attested vowels, e.g., the cross-linguistically common vowel /i/ is considered quantal, but less common /y/ is not.\nDispersion. The second core principle of vowel system organization is known as dispersion. As the name would imply, the principle states that the vowels in \u201cgood\u201d vowel systems tend to be spread out. The motivation for such a principle is clear\u2014a well-dispersed set of vowels reduces a listener\u2019s potential confusion over which vowel is being pronounced. See Schwartz et al. (1997) for a review of dispersion in vowel system typology and its interaction with focalization, which has led to the joint dispersion-focalization theory.\nNotation. We will denote the universal set of international phonetic alphabet (IPA) symbols as V . The observed vowel inventory for language ` has size n` and is denoted V ` = {(v`1,v`1), . . . , (v`n` ,v`n`)} \u2286 V \u00d7 Rd, where for each k \u2208 [1, n`], v`k \u2208 V is an IPA symbol assigned by a linguist and v`k \u2208 Rd is a vector of d measurable phonetic quantities. In short, the IPA symbol v`k was assigned as a label for a phoneme with pronunciation v`k. The ordering of the elements within V ` is arbitrary.\nGoals. This framework recognizes that the same IPA symbol v (such as /u/) may represent a slightly different sound v in one language than in another, although they are transcribed identically. We are specifically interested in how the vowels in a language influence one another\u2019s fine-grained pronunciation in Rd. In general, there is no reason to suspect that speakers of two languages, whose phonological systems contain the same IPA symbol, should produce that vowel with identical formants.\nData. For the remainder of the paper, we will take d = 2 so that each v = (F1, F2) \u2208 R2, the vector consisting of the first two formant values, as compiled from the field literature by BeckerKristal (2006). This dataset provides inventories V ` in the form above. Thus, we do not consider further variation of the vowel pronunciation that\nmay occur within the language (between speakers, between tokens of the vowel, or between earlier and later intervals within a token)."}, {"heading": "4 Phonemes versus Phones", "text": "Previous work (Cotterell and Eisner, 2017) has placed a distribution over discrete phonemes, ignoring the variation across languages in the pronunciation of each phoneme. In this paper, we crack open the phoneme abstraction, moving to a learned set of finer-grained phones.\nCotterell and Eisner (2017) proposed (among other options) using a determinantal point process (DPP) over a universal inventory V of 53 symbolic (IPA) vowels. A draw from such a DPP is a language-specific inventory of vowel phonemes, V \u2286 V . In this paper, we say that a language instead draws its inventory from a larger set V\u0304 , again using a DPP. In both cases, the reason to use a DPP is that it prefers relatively diverse inventories whose individual elements are relatively quantal.\nWhile we could in principle identify V\u0304 with Rd, for convenience we still take it to be a (large) discrete finite set V\u0304 = {v\u03041, . . . , v\u0304N}, whose elements we call phones. V\u0304 is a learned cross-linguistic parameter of our model; thus, its elements\u2014the \u201cuniversal phones\u201d\u2014may or may not correspond to phonetic categories traditionally used by linguists.\nWe presume that language ` draws from the DPP a subset V\u0304 ` \u2286 V\u0304 , whose size we call n`. For each universal phone v\u0304i that appears in this inventory V\u0304 `, the language then draws an observable languagespecific pronunciation v`i \u223c N ( \u00b5i, \u03c3 2I )\nfrom a distribution associated cross-linguistically with the universal phone v\u0304i. We now have an inventory of pronunciations.\nAs a final step in generating the vowel inventory, we could model IPA labels. For each v\u0304i \u2208 V\u0304 `, a field linguist presumably draws the IPA label v`i conditioned on all the pronunciations {v`i \u2208 Rd : v\u0304i \u2208 V\u0304 `} in the inventory (and perhaps also on their underlying phones v\u0304i \u2208 V\u0304 `). This labeling process may be complex. While each pronunciation in Rd (or each underlying phone in V\u0304) may have a preference for certain IPA labels in V , the n` labels must be drawn jointly because the linguist will take care not to use the same label for two phones, and also because the linguist may like to describe the inventory using a small number of distinct IPA features, which will tend to favor factorial grids of symbols. The linguist\u2019s use of IPA\nfeatures may also be informed by phonological and phonetic processes in the language. We leave modeling of this step to future work; so our current likelihood term ignores the evidence contributed by the IPA labels in the dataset, considering only the pronunciations in Rd.\nThe overall idea is that human languages ` draw their inventories from some universal prior, which we are attempting to reconstruct. A caveat is that we will train our method by maximum-likelihood, which does not quantify our uncertainty about the reconstructed parameters. An additional caveat is that some languages in our dataset are related to one another, which belies the idea that they were drawn independently. Ideally, one ought to capture these relationships using hierarchical or evolutionary modeling techniques."}, {"heading": "5 Determinantal Point Processes", "text": "Before delving into our generative model, we briefly review technical background used by Cotterell and Eisner (2017). A DPP is a probability distribution over the subsets of a fixed ground set of size N\u2014in our case, the set of phones V\u0304 . The DPP is usually given as an L-ensemble (Borodin and Rains, 2005), meaning that it is parameterized by a positive semi-definite matrix L \u2208 RN\u00d7N . Given a discrete base set V\u0304 of phones, the probability of a subset V\u0304 \u2286 V\u0304 is given by\np(V\u0304 ) \u221d det (LV\u0304 ) , (1)\nwhere LV\u0304 is the submatrix of L corresponding to the rows and columns associated with the subset V\u0304 \u2286 V\u0304 . The entry Lij , where i 6= j, has the effect of describing the similarity between the elements v\u0304i and v\u0304j (both in V\u0304)\u2014an ingredient needed to model dispersion. And, the entry Lii describes the quality\u2014focalization\u2014of the vowel v\u0304i, i.e., how much the model wants to have v\u0304i in a sampled set independent of the other members."}, {"heading": "5.1 Probability Kernel", "text": "In this work, each phone v\u0304i \u2208 V\u0304 is associated with a probability density over the space of possible pronunciations R2. Our measure of phone similarity will consider the \u201coverlap\u201d between the densities associated with two phones. This works as follows: Given two densities f(x, y) and f \u2032(x, y) over R2, we define the kernel (Jebara et al., 2004) as\nK(f, f \u2032; \u03c1) = \u222b\nx\n\u222b\ny f(x, y)\u03c1f \u2032(x, y)\u03c1dx dy, (3)\nwith inverse temperature parameter \u03c1.

Each vector takes two steps. For each i \u2208 V\u0304 `, we generate an underlying v\u0303i \u2208 R2 from the corresponding Gaussian phone. Then, we run\nthis vector through a feed-forward neural network \u03bd\u03b8 with parameters \u03b8.

We briefly draw connections between our theory and the linguistics literature.\nWhy underlying phones? A technical assumption of our model is the existence of a universal set of underlying phones. Each phone is equipped with a probability distribution over reported acoustic measurements (pronunciations), to allow for a single phone to account for multiple slightly different pronunciations in different languages (though never in the same language). This distribution can capture both actual interlingual variation and also random noise in the measurement process.\nWhile our universal phones may seem to resemble the universal IPA symbols used in phonological transcription, they lack the rich featural specifications of such phonemes. A phone in our model has no features other than its mean position, which wholly determines its behavior. Our universal phones are not a substantive linguistic hypothesis, but are essentially just a way of partitioning R2 into finitely many small regions whose similarity and focalization can be precomputed. This technical trick allows us to use a discrete rather than a continuous DPP over the R2 space.1\nWhy a neural network? Our phones are Gaussians of spherical variance \u03c32, presumed to be scattered with variance 1 about a two-dimensional latent vowel space. Distances in this latent space are used to compute the dissimilarity of phones for modeling dispersion, and also to describe the phone\u2019s ability to vary across languages. That is, two phones that are distant in the latent space can appear in the same inventory\u2014presumably they are easy to discriminate in both perception and articulation\u2014and it is easy to choose which one better explains an acoustic measurement, thereby affecting the other measurements that may appear in the inventory.\nWe relate this latent space to measurable acoustic space by a learned diffeomorphism \u03bd\u03b8 (Cotterell and Eisner, 2017). \u03bd\u22121\u03b8 can be regarded as warping the acoustic distances into perceptual/articulatory distances. In some \u201chigh-resolution\u201d regions of acoustic space, phones with fairly similar (F1, F2) values might yet be far apart in the latent space. Conversely, in other regions, relatively large acous-\n1Indeed, we could have simply taken our universal phone set to be a huge set of tiny, regularly spaced overlapping Gaussians that \u201ccovered\u201d (say) the unit circle. As a computational matter, we instead opted to use a smaller set of Gaussians, giving the learner the freedom to infer their positions and tune their variance \u03c32. Because of this freedom, this set should not be too large, or a MAP learner may overfit the training data with zero-variance Gaussians and be unable to explain the test languages\u2014similar to overfitting a Gaussian mixture model.\ntic changes in some direction might not prevent two phones from acting as similar or two pronunciations from being attributed to the same phone. In general, a unit circle of radius \u03c3 in latent space may be mapped by \u03bd\u03b8 to an oddly shaped connected region in acoustic space, and a Gaussian in latent space may be mapped to a multimodal distribution."}, {"heading": "8 Inference and Learning", "text": "We fit our model via MAP-EM (Dempster et al., 1977).

In phonetic annotation, it is common to map each sound in a language back to this universal discrete alphabet. Under such an annotation scheme, it is easy to discern, cross-linguistically, which vowels originate from the same phoneme: an /I/ in German may be roughly equated with an /I/ in English. However, it is not clear how consistent this annotation truly is. There are several reasons to expect high-variance in the cross-linguistic acoustic signal. First, IPA symbols are primarily useful for interlinked phonological distinctions, i.e., one applies the symbol /I/ to distinguish it from /i/ in the given language, rather than to associate it with the sound bearing the same symbol in a second language. Second, field linguists often resort to the closest common IPA symbol, rather than an exact match: if a language makes no distinction between /i/ and /I/, it is more common to denote the sound with a /i/. Thus, IPA may not be as universal as hoped. Our dataset contains 50 IPA symbols so this baseline is only reported for N = 50."}, {"heading": "9.3 Evaluation", "text": "Evaluation in our setting is tricky. The scientific goal of our work is to place a bit of linguistic theory on a firm probabilistic footing, rather than a downstream engineering-task, whose performance we could measure. We consider three metrics.\nCross-Entropy. Our first evaluation metric is cross-entropy: the average negative log-probability of the vowel systems in held-out test data, given the universal inventory ofN phones that we trained through EM. We find this to be the cleanest method for scientific evaluation\u2014it is the metric of optimization and has a clear interpretation: how surprised was the model to see the vowel systems of held-out, but attested, languages? The cross-entropy is the negative log of the\u220f[ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] expression in eq. (2), with ` now rang-\ning over held-out languages.3 Wallach et al. (2009) give several methods for estimating the intractable sum in language `. We use the simple harmonic mean estimator, based on 50 samples of a` drawn with our Gibbs sampler (warm-started from the final E-step of training).\nCloze Evaluation. In addition, following Cotterell and Eisner (2017), we evaluate our trained model\u2019s ability to perform a cloze task (Taylor, 1953). Given n`\u22121 or n`\u22122 of the vowels in heldout language `, can we predict the pronunciations vk of the remaining 1 or 2? We predict vk to be \u03bd\u03b8(\u00b5i) where i = a ` k is the phone inferred by the sampler. Note that the sampler\u2019s inference here is based only on the observed vowels (the likelihood) and the focalization-dispersion preferences of the DPP (the prior). We report the expected error of such a prediction\u2014where error is quantified by Euclidean distance in (F1, F2) formant space\u2014over the same 50 samples of a`.\nFor instance, consider a previously unseen vowel system with formant values {(499, 2199), (861, 1420), (571, 1079)}. A \u201ccloze1\u201d evaluation would aim to predict {(499, 2199)} as the missing\n3Since that expression is the product of both probability distributions and probability densities, our \u201ccross-entropy\u201d metric is actually the sum of both entropy terms and (potentially negative) differential entropy terms. Thus, a value of 0 has no special significance.\nvowel, given {(861, 1420), (571, 1079)}, and the fact that n` = 3. A \u201ccloze12\u201d evaluation would aim to predict two missing vowels."}, {"heading": "9.4 Experimental Details", "text": "Here, we report experimental details and the hyperparameters that we use to achieve the results reported. We consider a neural network \u03bd\u03b8 with k \u2208 [1, 4] layers and find k = 1 the best performer on development data. Recall that our diffeomorphism constraint requires that each layer have exactly two hidden units, the same as the number of observed formants. We consider N \u2208 {15, 25, 50, 100} phones as well as letting N fluctuate with reversible-jump MCMC (see footnote 1). We train for 100 iterations of EM, taking S = 5 samples at each E-step. At each M-step, we run 50 iterations of SGD for the focalization NN and also for the diffeomorphism NN. For each N , we selected (\u03c32, \u03c1) by minimizing cross-entropy on a held-out development set. We considered (\u03c32, \u03c1) \u2208 {10k}5k=1 \u00d7 {\u03c1k}5k=1."}, {"heading": "9.5 Results and Error Analysis", "text": "We report results in Tab. 1. We find that our DPP model improves over the baselines. The results support two claims: (i) dispersion plays an important role in the structure of vowel systems and (ii) learning a non-linear transformation of a Gaussian improves our ability to model sets of formant-pairs. Also, we observe that as we increase the number of phones, the role of the DPP becomes more important. We visualize a sample of the trained alignment in Fig. 3.\nFrequency Encodes Dispersion. Why does dispersion not always help? The models with fewer phones do not reap the benefits that the models with more phones do. The reason lies in the fact that the most common vowel formants are already dispersed. This indicates that we still have not quite modeled the mechanisms that select for good vowel formants, despite our work at the phonetic level; further research is needed. We would prefer a model that explains the evolutionary motivation of sound systems as communication systems.\nNumber of Induced Phones. What is most salient in the number of induced phones is that it is close to the number of IPA phonemes in the data. However, the performance of the phonemesupervised system is much worse, indicating that, perhaps, while the linguists have the right idea about the number of universal symbols, they did not specify the correct IPA symbol in all cases. Our data analysis indicates that this is often due to pragmatic concerns in linguistic field analysis. For example, even if /I/ is the proper IPA symbol for the sound, if there is no other sound in the vicinity the annotator may prefer to use more common /i/."}, {"heading": "10 Related Work", "text": "Most closely related to our work is the classic study of Liljencrants and Lindblom (1972), who provide a simulation-based account of vowel systems. They argued that minima of a certain objective that encodes dispersion should correspond to canonical vowel systems of a given size n. Our tack is different in that we construct a generative probability model, whose parameters we learn from data. However, the essence of modeling is the same in that we explain formant values, rather than discrete IPA symbols. By extension, our work is also closely related to extensions of this theory (Schwartz et al., 1997; Roark, 2001) that focused on incorporating the notion of focalization into the experiments.\nOur present paper can also be regarded as a continuation of Cotterell and Eisner (2017), in which we used DPPs to model vowel inventories as sets of discrete IPA symbols. That paper pretended that each IPA symbol had a single cross-linguistic (F1, F2) pair, an idealization that we remove in this paper by discarding the IPA symbols and modeling formant values directly."}, {"heading": "11 Conclusion", "text": "Our model combines existing techniques of probabilistic modeling and inference to attempt to fit the actual distribution of the world\u2019s vowel systems. We presented a generative probability model of sets of measured (F1, F2) pairs. We view this as a necessary step in the development of generative probability models that can explain the distribution of the world\u2019s languages. Previous work on generating vowel inventories has focused on how those inventories were transcribed into IPA by field linguists, whereas we focus on the field linguists\u2019 acoustic measurements of how the vowels are actually pronounced."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to acknowledge Tim Vieira, Katharina Kann, Sebastian Mielke and Chu-Cheng Lin for reading many early drafts.
