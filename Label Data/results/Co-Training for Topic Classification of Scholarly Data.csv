"As science advances, scientists around the world continue to produce a large number of research articles, which provide the technological basis for worldwide dissemination of scientific discoveries.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['As science advances, scientists around the world continue to produce a large number of research articles, which provide the technological basis for worldwide dissemination of scientific discoveries.']"

These libraries require effective and efficient methods for topic classification of research articles in order to facilitate the retrieval of content that is tailored to the interests of specific individuals or groups.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Supervised approaches for topic classification of research articles have been developed, which generally use either the content of the articles (Caragea et al., 2011), or take into account the citation relation between research articles (Lu and Getoor, 2003).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To be successful, these supervised approaches assume the availability of large amounts of labeled
data, which require intensive human labeling effort.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we explore a semi-supervised approach that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with small amounts of labeled data for accurate topic classification of research articles, while minimizing the human effort required for data labeling.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['In this paper, we explore a semi-supervised approach that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with small amounts of labeled data for accurate topic classification of research articles, while minimizing the human effort required for data labeling.']"
"In the scholarly domain, research articles (or papers) are highly interconnected in giant citation networks, in which papers cite or are cited by other papers.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['In the scholarly domain, research articles (or papers) are highly interconnected in giant citation networks, in which papers cite or are cited by other papers.']"
"We posit that, in addition to a document’s textual content and its local neighborhood in the citation network, other information exists that has the potential to improve topic classification.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, in a citation network, information flows from one paper to another via the citation relation (Shi et al., 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This information flow and the topical influence of one paper on another are specifically captured by means of citation contexts, i.e., short text segments surrounding a citation’s mention.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These contexts are not arbitrary, but they often serve as brief summaries of a cited paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We therefore hypothesize that these micro-summaries can be successfully used as an independent view of a research article in a co-training framework to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for the task of topic classification.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The idea of using terms from citation contexts stems from the analysis of hyperlinks and the graph structure of the Web, which are instrumental in Web search (Manning et al., 2008).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Many search engines follow the intuition that the anchor text pointing to a page is a good descriptor of its content, and thus anchor text terms are used as additional index terms for a target webpage.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The use of links and anchor text was thoroughly researched for information retrieval (Koolen and Kamps, 2010), broadening a user’s search (Chakrabarti et al., 1998), query refinement (Kraft and Zien, 2004), and enriching document representations (Metzler et al., 2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

Contributions and Organization.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present a co-training approach to topic classification of research papers that effectively incorporates information from a citation network, in addition to the information contained in each paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The result of this classification task will aid indexing of documents in digital libraries, and hence, will lead to improved organization, search, retrieval, and recommendation of scientific documents.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our contributions are as follows:
• We propose the use of citation contexts as an additional view in a co-training approach, which results in high accuracy classifiers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To our knowledge, this has not been addressed in the literature.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We show experimentally that our co-training
classifiers significantly outperform: (1) supervised classifiers trained using either content or citation contexts independently, for the same fraction of labeled data; and (2) several other semi-supervised classifiers, trained on the same fractions of labeled and unlabeled data as co-training.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We also show that using the citation context
information available in citation networks, the human effort involved in data labeling for training accurate classifiers can be largely reduced.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our co-training classifiers trained on a very small sample of labeled data and a large sample of unlabeled data yield accurate topic classification of research articles.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 2, we discuss related work.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Section 3 describes our data and its characteristics, followed by the presentation of our proposed co-training approach in Section 4.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present experiments and results in Section 5, and conclude the paper and present future directions of our work in Section 6.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We discuss here the most relevant works to our study.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
A large variety of methods have been proposed in the literature with regard to automatic text classification and topic prediction.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Different classifiers have been applied on the Vector Space Model (VSM), in which a document is represented as a vector of words or phrases asso-
ciated with their TF-IDF score, i.e. term frequency - inverse document frequency (Zhang et al., 2011; Kansheng et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"VSM is the most used method due to its simple, efficient and easy to understand implementation.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Another widely used model is the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) where co-occurrences are analyzed to find semantic relationships between words or phrases (Zhang et al., 2011; Ganiz et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, a great range of classifiers were used for this task, including: Naı̈ve Bayes (Lewis and Ringuette, 1994), Knearest neighbors (Yang, 1999) and Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These techniques, however, all require a large number of labeled documents in order to build accurate classifiers.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, we propose a co-training algorithm that only requires a small amount of labeled data in order to make accurate topic classification.
Semi-supervised methods essentially involve different means of transferring labels from labeled to unlabeled samples in the process of learning a classifier that can generalize well on new unseen data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Co-training was originally introduced in (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) where it was used to classify web pages into academic course home page or not.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This approach has two views of the data as follows: the content of a web page, and the words found in the anchor text of the hyperlinks that point to the web page.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wan (2009) used co-training for cross-lingual sentiment classification of product reviews, where English and Chinese features were considered as two independent views of the data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, Gollapalli et al. (2013) used co-training to identify authors’ homepages from the current-day university websites.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The paper presents novel features, extracted from the URL of a page, that were used in conjunction with content features, forming two complementary views of the data.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Citation networks have been used before in other problems.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Caragea et al. (2014) used citation contexts to extract informative features for keyphrase extraction.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Lu and Getoor (2003) proposed an approach for document classification that used only citation links, without any textual data from the citation contexts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Ritchie et al. (2006) used a combination of terms from citation contexts and existing index terms of a paper to improve indexing of cited papers.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Citation contexts were also used to improve the performance of citation recommendation systems (Kataria et al., 2010) and to study author influence in document networks
(Kataria et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, citation contexts were used for scientific paper summarization (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011; Qazvinian et al., 2010; Qazvinian and Radev, 2008; Mei and Zhai, 2008; Lehnert et al., 1990)",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, in Qazvinian et al. (2010), a set of important keyphrases is extracted first from the citation contexts in which the paper to be summarized is cited by other papers and then the “best” subset of sentences that contain such keyphrases is returned as the summary.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Mei and Zhai (2008) used information from citation contexts to determine what sentences of a paper are of high impact (as measured by the influence of a target paper on further studies of similar or related topics).,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These sentences constitute the impact-based summary of the paper.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Despite the use of citation contexts and anchor text in many information retrieval and natural language processing tasks, to our knowledge, we are the first to propose the incorporation of citation context information available in citation networks in a co-training framework for topic classification of research papers.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The dataset used in our experiments is a subset sampled from the CiteSeerx digital library1 and labeled by Dr. Lise Getoor’s research group at the University of Maryland.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"This subset was previously used in several studies including (Lu and Getoor, 2003) and (Kataria et al., 2010).",3 Data,[0],[0]
"The dataset consists of 3186 labeled papers, with each paper being categorized into one of six classes: Agents, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) and Databases (DB).",3 Data,[1.0],"['The dataset consists of 3186 labeled papers, with each paper being categorized into one of six classes: Agents, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) and Databases (DB).']"
"For each paper, we acquire the citation contexts directly from CiteSeerx.",3 Data,[0],[0]
A citation context is defined as a window of n words surrounding a citation mention.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"We differentiate between cited and citing contexts for a paper as follows: let d be a target paper and C be a citation network such that d ∈ C. A cited context for d is a context in which d is cited by some paper di in C. A citing context for d is a context in which d is citing some paper dj in C. If a paper is cited in multiple contexts within another paper, the contexts are aggregated into a single context.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For each paper in the dataset, we have at least one cited or one citing context.",3 Data,[1.0],"['For each paper in the dataset, we have at least one cited or one citing context.']"
"A summary of the dataset is provided in Table 1.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
"1http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/
As expected, we have a higher number of cited contexts than citing contexts.",3 Data,[0],[0]
This is due to the page restrictions often imposed to research articles that can limit the number of papers each article can cite.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, a good research paper can accumulate hundreds of citations, and hence, cited contexts over the years.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
Context lengths.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"In CiteSeerx, citation contexts have about 50 words on each side of a citation mention.",3 Data,[0],[0]
A previous study by Ritchie et al. (2008) shows that a fixed window length of about 100 words around a citation mention is generally effective for information retrieval tasks.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"For this reason, we use the contexts provided by CiteSeerx directly.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"In future, it would be interesting to study more sophisticated approaches to identifying the text that is relevant to a target citation (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2012; Teufel, 1999) and study the influence of context lengths on our task.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For all experiments, our labeled dataset is split in train, validation and test sets.",3 Data,[1.0],"['For all experiments, our labeled dataset is split in train, validation and test sets.']"
The validation and test sets have about 200 papers each.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"We sampled another set of papers from the labeled dataset in order to simulate the existence of unlabeled data, with a fixed size of around 2000 papers.",3 Data,[0],[0]
The remaining 786 papers are used as labeled training data.,3 Data,[1.0],['The remaining 786 papers are used as labeled training data.']
Each experiment was repeated 10 times with 10 different random seeds and the results were averaged.,3 Data,[0],[0]
Blum and Mitchell (1998) proposed the cotraining algorithm in the context of webpage classification.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[1.0],['Blum and Mitchell (1998) proposed the cotraining algorithm in the context of webpage classification.']
"In co-training, the idea is that two classifiers trained on two different views of the data teach one another by re-training each classifier on the data enriched with predicted examples that the other classifier is most confident about.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[1.0],"['In co-training, the idea is that two classifiers trained on two different views of the data teach one another by re-training each classifier on the data enriched with predicted examples that the other classifier is most confident about.']"
"In Blum and Mitchell (1998), webpages are represented using two different views: (1) using terms from webpages’ content and (2) using terms from the anchor text of hyperlinks pointing to these pages.

In this paper, we study the applicability and extension of the co-training algorithm to the task of topic classification of research papers, which are embedded in large citation networks.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Here, in addition to the information contained in a paper itself, citing and cited papers capture different aspects (e.g., topicality, domain of study,",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"algorithms used) about the target paper (Teufel et al., 2006), with citation contexts playing an instrumental role.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"We conjecture that citation contexts, which act as brief summaries about a cited paper, provide important clues in predicting the topicality of a target paper.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[1.0],"['We conjecture that citation contexts, which act as brief summaries about a cited paper, provide important clues in predicting the topicality of a target paper.']"
These clues give rise to the design of our co-training based model for topic classification of research papers.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In our model, we use the content of a paper as one view and the citation contexts as another view of our data.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[1.0],"['In our model, we use the content of a paper as one view and the citation contexts as another view of our data.']"
"In particular, for the content of a paper, we use its title and abstract as it is commonly used in the literature (Lu and Getoor, 2003); for the citation contexts, we use both the cited and citing contexts, as described in the previous section.
",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
Our co-training procedure is described in Algorithm 1.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
L and U represent the labeled and unlabeled datasets and contain instances from both views.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
The fractions of the training set are obtained from the 786 papers by selecting k% random examples from each class.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[1.0],['The fractions of the training set are obtained from the 786 papers by selecting k% random examples from each class.']
"For a round of co-training, we train classifiers C1 and C2 on the two views.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Next, s examples are sampled from the unlabeled data into S, and C1, C2 are used to obtain predictions for these s examples.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"The GetMostConfidentExamples method is a generic placeholder that stands for a function that deter-
mines what examples from S are chosen to be added into training.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Finally, at the end of an iteration, the examples left into S are moved back to U , and the algorithm iterates until there are no more unlabeled examples in U .",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
The final classifier C is obtained by combining C1 and C2 using the product of their class probability distributions.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"The class with the highest posterior probability (of the product of the two distributions) is chosen as the predicted class.
",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike the original co-training algorithm described by Blum and Mitchell (1998), which tackled a binary classification task (course vs. noncourse page classification), we address a multiclass classification problem, where each example (i.e., research paper) is classified into one of six different classes.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Moreover, in Blum and Mitchell (1998), the co-training algorithm moves p highest confidence positive examples and n highest confidence negative examples from S to L, where p : n represents the class distribution in the original labeled training set (i.e., if there are 10 positive examples and 90 negative examples in the labeled set L, then p = 1 positive and n = 9 negative examples are moved to the labeled set at each iteration of co-training).",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike, this approach that preserves the class distribution of the original labeled training set, we move into L all examples that are classified with a confidence above a certain threshold.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"First, the proposed method is evaluated on the validation set.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We first compare it against various supervised and semi-supervised baselines.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Next, we report the performance of our co-training algorithm under different scenarios, where either cited or citing contexts are used.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We also show the most informative words for each classifier.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Finally, with the best parameters obtained on the validation set, we report the precision, recall and F1-score, obtained by each method, on the test set.
",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In experiments, the sample size ‘s’ from Algorithm 1 is set to 300, i.e. the number of documents sampled from the unlabeled pool at each iteration; the confidence threshold is set to 0.95, i.e. if both classifiers agree on the class label and have a confidence ≥ 0.95, the instance is labeled and moved into the labeled training set.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"These parameters are estimated on the validation set, but the results are not shown due to space limitation.
",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
Evaluation Measures.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We report results averaged over ten different runs with random splits.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"For each random split, we return the weighted average precision, recall and F1-score.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In all the experiments, we use the Naı̈ve Bayes Multinomial classifier and its Weka implementation2, with term-frequencies as feature values.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"We experimented with both TF and TF-IDF scores, using different classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Naı̈ve Bayes Multinomial, and simple Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers), but Naive Bayes Multinomial with TF performed best.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
How does co-training compare with supervised learning techniques?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we compare our co-training method with two supervised baselines: (1) when only document content is used and (2) when only citation contexts are used.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 1 shows the F1-scores achieved using different initial training sizes.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"We can see that overall, the citation contexts are better at predicting the topic of a document compared with the content, outperforming them in 9 out of 10 experimental settings.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The only exception to this trend is when a small number (5%) of training instances is available, in which case the supervised content view performs better, reaching an F1-score of 0.534.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Regardless, the co-training method shows significant improvement over both baselines, in all experiments.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Starting with an F1-score of 0.572, it continues to improve its performance as the training percentage is increasing.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The maximum F1score, i.e. 0.742, is reached when 30% of the labeled training set is used.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Note that the difference in performance between co-training and the two supervised baselines is statistically significant for

a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
A fully supervised baseline that uses 100% of the training set achieves an F1-score of 0.720 (using content) and 0.738 (using citation contexts).,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In contrast, co-training requires only 15% of the labeled training set to outperform the fully supervised content baseline and 30% of the training set to outperform the fully supervised citation contexts baseline.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Consequently, using a co-training approach that includes citation contexts as well as the document content can not only increase the performance, but will also significantly reduce the need of expensive labeled instances.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 illustrates the confusion matrices of three experiments: (a) supervised content view, i.e. the title and abstract, (b) supervised citation contexts view, and (c) co-training that uses both views.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
These experiments use 10% of the training set.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Each of the matrices are represented by a heat map, i.e. the redder the color, the higher the value assigned to that position.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
An accuracy of 1 will be represented by a matrix with red blocks on the main diagonal and white blocks everywhere else.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"This experiment was performed 10 times with 10 different seeds and the results have been averaged.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, the matrix that uses only titles and abstracts, i.e. left side, is showing the highest percentage of misclassified documents, classifying correctly about 58.8% instances, on average.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Using only citation contexts in a supervised framework, i.e. center matrix, we reach a higher accuracy of 60.7%.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The co-training method, which uses the content of the paper and citations as two independent views, significantly increases the average accuracy to 67.3%.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
This experiment shows that citation contexts are better than titles and abstracts at predicting the topic of a document.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, our proposed approach, which uses the content of the paper as well as citation contexts, achieves higher results than each view used separately.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The difference in accuracy is statistically significant across all three experiments for a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Overall, the Agents class seem to be the easiest to classify, reaching an accuracy value of 91.6% when using co-training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the AI class is the hardest to classify.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
One reason for this is that the AI class contains the lowest number of instances in the dataset.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Another can be that the AI class is the most general among all classes and therefore, classifying documents with this la-

"Right: using co-training.
bel can be a difficult task even for a human.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Other common misclassifications occur between classes like HCI and Agents, ML and IR or AI and ML, due to their similarity.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
How does our co-training method compare with other supervised approaches?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we compare the performance of co-training against two other methods: early and late fusion.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In early fusion, the feature vectors of the two views are concatenated, creating a single representation of the data.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[1.0],"['In early fusion, the feature vectors of the two views are concatenated, creating a single representation of the data.']"
"In contrast, late fusion trains two separate classifiers and then combines them by taking the label with the highest confidence.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0.9999999614533072],"['In contrast, late fusion trains two separate classifiers and then combines them by taking the label with the highest confidence.']"
Figure 3 shows this comparison over different training sizes.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[1.0],['Figure 3 shows this comparison over different training sizes.']
"The results show that the cotraining method is more accurate than all others, performing best in all 10 experimental settings.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Late fusion has an overall lower performance compared with co-training, but is in a tight correlation with it.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, early fusion achieves the lowest F1-score across the experiments.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The reported results are statistically significant at p value of 0.05, when the training percentage is between 5 and 35.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[1.0],"['The reported results are statistically significant at p value of 0.05, when the training percentage is between 5 and 35.']"
"Therefore, we can say that train-
ing two separate classifiers, one of each view, yields higher performance compared with training a single classifier that incorporates both views.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Moreover, using a co-training approach that incorporates information from unlabeled data into the model, will help the two classifiers increase their confidences and minimize the error rate.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
How does co-training compare with semisupervised methods?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Here, we present results comparing co-training with two other wellknown semi-supervised techniques: self-training and Naı̈ve Bayes with Expectation Maximization.
Self-Training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"First, we show results of the comparison of co-training with two variations of selftraining: (1) self-training using only document content, and (2) self-training using only citation contexts.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 4 shows the results of this experiment.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Self-training is similar to co-training, except that it uses only one view of the data (Zhu, 2005).",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Self-training parameters, e.g., sample size ‘s’ or number of iterations, are estimated as in cotraining.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Although the document content version of selftraining outperforms co-training when using 5%
of the training instances, we can see that overall, there is a significant difference in terms of F1score values in the favor of co-training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In 9 out of 10 experiments, our co-training approach is superior to both self-training methods.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The results are statistically significant across all experimental setups for a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Expectation Maximization.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Figure 5 shows the F1-score values obtained after running NBM with EM with the same training, unlabeled and test sets.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The EM algorithm uses the same classifier, i.e. NBM, and the weight for each unlabeled instance is set to 1, as this setting achieved the highest results.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Two different experiments were performed using EM: (1) using only document content, and (2) using only citation contexts.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in the figure, overall, the co-training approach significantly outperforms both variations of EM.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"However, the co-training method falls short when using 5% of the training instances, where EM Content and EM Citations methods are achieving higher F1-score values.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[1.0],"['However, the co-training method falls short when using 5% of the training instances, where EM Content and EM Citations methods are achieving higher F1-score values.']"
"Nonetheless, both EM variations tend to achieve an F1-score value below or equal to 0.710, whereas co-training reaches performance values of 0.74 or higher.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Again, the comparison results between co-training and both variations of EM are statistically significant for training sizes between 10% and 50%, for a p value of 0.05.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Which of the two types of citation contexts (cited or citing) help the task of topic classification more and how does co-training perform in the absence of either one?,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
The answer to this question is important as there are cases in which citation contexts are not readily available.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"One frequently encountered example includes newly published research papers that have no cited contexts.
