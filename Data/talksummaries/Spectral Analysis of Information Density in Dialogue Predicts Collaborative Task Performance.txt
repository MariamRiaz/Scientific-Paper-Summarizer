2	20	Can we use them to measure communicative effectiveness?
3	27	Grounding theory (Clark and Brennan, 1991) models a successful communication as a process during which “common ground” (i.e., mutual knowledge, beliefs etc.)
4	17	is jointly built among interlocutors.
5	49	The interactive alignment model (IAM) (Pickering and Garrod, 2004) proposes that the ultimate goal of dialogue is the alignment of interlocutors’ situational model, which is helped by alignment at all other lower representation levels (e.g., lexical, syntactic etc.
7	23	Recently, empirical studies have verified the explanatory powers of the above-mentioned theories, especially the IAM, utilizing dialogues recorded and transcribed from various collaborative tasks conducted in laboratory settings (Reitter and Moore, 2007; Reitter and Moore, 2014; Fusaroli et al., 2012; Fusaroli and Tylén, 2016).
13	12	Recent work has already used information theory to study the dynamics of dialogue.
14	26	Xu and Reitter (2016b) observed that the amount of lexical information (measured by entropy) from interlocutors of different roles, converges within the span of topic episodes in natural spoken dialogue.
15	21	Anon (2017) interpret this converging pattern as a re- 623 flection of the dynamic process in which the information contributed by two interlocutors fluctuates in a complementary way at the early stage, and gradually reaches an equilibrium status.
16	22	Xu and Reitter (2016b) also correlated this entropy converging pattern with the topic shift phenomenon that frequently occurs in natural conversation (Ng and Bradac, 1993), and proposed that it reflects the process of interlocutors building the common ground that is necessary for the ongoing topics of conversation.
17	23	Based on Xu and Reitter’s (2016) finding that entropy converging pattern repeatedly occurs within dialogue (though not necessarily at strictly regular intervals), it is reasonable to expect that after applying some spectral analysis techniques (time space to frequency space conversion) to the entropy series of dialogue, the frequency space representations should demonstrate some patterns that are distinct from white noise, because the periodicity properties in time space are captured.
18	38	Furthermore, we expect that how the frequency representations of two interlocutors correlate provides some information about the higher level properties of dialogue, e.g., the task performance etc.
19	28	The thought is intuitive: If we imagine the entropy series from two interlocutors as two ideal sinusoidal signals s1 and s2 (supposedly of different frequencies, f1 and f2) (Figure 1), then the observed converging pattern can be thought of as a segment from the full spans of the signals.
20	29	Then the frequency space properties, such as how close f1 and f2 are, and the phase difference φ between them, will definitely affect the shape of the converging pattern (solid lines in Figure 1).
22	20	Based on the above considerations, the goal of the present study is to explore how the frequency space representations of the entropy series of dialogue are correlated with the collaborative performance of task.
70	12	The collaborative performance in the task is measured by the PATHDEV variable, which quantifies the deviation between the paths drawn by interlocutors.
101	14	The power spectrum overlap, PSOk, is calculated by computing the common area under the curves of PAk and P B k is calculated, and normalizing by the total area of the two curves (see Figure 2).
105	15	One common assumption of Fourier transforms is that the signals (time series) are stationary (Dwivedi and Subba Rao, 2011).
121	13	Linear models show that the average spectrums of the entropy data have slopes that are significantly larger than zero (For Map Task, β = 2.3× 10−2, SE = 9.4× 10−3, p < .05; for DJD, β = 314.1, SE = 19.8, p < .001), while the slopes of the white noise data are not significantly different from zero.
156	29	Second, high synchrony due to both interlocutors providing ineffective information, which indicates overlap in spectrums near the low frequency band.
157	83	Obviously this type of ineffective communication is not helpful to the collaborative task.
162	37	We get non-significant coefficients for both models: For Map Task, F (1, 113) = .004, p > .05; for DJD, F (1, 14) = .772, p > .05.
167	56	Thus we obtain RP from the local peak frequency components, and use the mean, median, and maximum values of them as predictors.
177	16	For example, after interlocutor A contributes a big piece of information, the other one, B, does not rush to make new substantial contributions, but instead keeps her utterances at low entropy until it is the proper time to take a turn to contribute.
181	20	On the contrary, if B rushes to speak a lot shortly after the A’s input, then it will probably cause information overload and be harmful to communication.
182	18	Therefore, we believe that the RP statistic captures the extent to which interlocutors manage the proper “timing” of information contribution to maintain effective communication.
183	14	Here we explore whether the frequency domain features, PSO and RP, can help with an existing framework that utilizes alignment features, such as the repetition of lexical and syntactic elements, to predict the success of dialogue in MapTask (Reitter and Moore, 2007).
192	33	The results indicate that the frequency domain features (PSO and RP) of the sentence information density can capture some hidden factors of task success that are unexplained by the alignment approach.
194	32	What we show here is that regular, repeated patterns of information-dense and information-sparse turns seem to make speakers more or less compatible with each other.
197	21	Our work adds a brick to the series of endeavors on studying the linguistic and behavioral factors of successful dialogue, and for the first time (as far as we know) demonstrates quantitatively that the dynamics of not just “what” and “how” we say, but also “how much” we say and the “timing” of distributing what we say in dialogue, are relevant to the quality of communication.
198	21	Although the way we model information in language is simply the entropy at lexical level, we believe the findings still reveal the nature of information production and processing in dialogue.
