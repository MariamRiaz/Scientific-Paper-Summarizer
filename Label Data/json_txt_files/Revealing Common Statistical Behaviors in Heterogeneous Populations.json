Copyright 2018 by the author(s).\nanalysis (Hagler et al., 2006), etc. Group analyses often rely on the assumption that all subjects in the group behave according to the same statistical model. For example, to estimate the covariance (or partial covariance) matrix of several variables, a popular approach is to average the covariance matrices estimated for each of the individual subjects in the group (Power et al., 2011). This is done using either the Euclidean mean (arithmetic average) or the intrinsic (Riemannian) mean (Fo\u0308rstner & Moonen, 2003), (Fletcher & Joshi, 2007), which respects the geometry of the manifold of positive definite matrices (Varoquaux et al., 2010a).\nReal data, however, rarely conform to this assumption. Often times, each subject in a group deviates from the common model in a different way. For example, it has been shown that estimates of connectivity patterns from fMRI scans, tend to vary significantly between subjects (Moussa et al., 2012). Subject-specific deviations may even be more dominant than the common model itself. Therefore, if ignored, these deviations may severely degrade the quality of the estimate of the common model. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 1 in the context of nonparametric density estimation of two variables (brain regions). In this example, the deviations from the common model are additive and have a different distribution for each subject. Thus, as can be seen on the right, kernel density estimation (KDE) applied to the entire group, fails to reveal the common behavior.\nApproaches for accounting for subject-specific deviations often make limiting assumptions. For example, in the context of covariance estimation, (Varoquaux et al., 2010b) assumed that the precision matrices of all subjects in the group have the same sparsity pattern, and proposed a modified graph Lasso technique (Friedman et al., 2008) for simultaneously estimating those matrices. In (Marrelec et al., 2006), the authors assumed that each subject\u2019s samples follow a Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that follows an inverse Wishart distribution around the group covariance. In the context of regression, a popular strategy is to use a linear mixed-effects model (Friston et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2013), which relies on a Gaussian distribution assumption for the subject specific factors. Similar lines of work include grouplevel independent component analysis (ICA) (Calhoun et al., 2001; Beckmann & Smith, 2005; Varoquaux et al., 2010c), dictionary learning (Varoquaux et al., 2011; Mensch et al., 2016), and causal structure estimation (Ramsey et al., 2010).\nIn this paper we present non-parametric methods for estimating a common model in the presence of subject-specific noise factors. Specifically, we present a common-covariance estimation algorithm and a common probability density function (pdf) estimation method, both of which do not assume any particular form for the underlying distributions. Our only assumption is that the subject-specific noise factors are additive and have diverse distributions (otherwise they could be considered part of the common model). In this setting, the Euclidean and Riemannian mean estimates do not approach the true covariance matrix as the number of subjects grows. In contrast, we prove that our estimate does converge to the true covariance under very mild assumptions. We verify the advantages of our approach through extensive experiments on simulated and on real data."}, {"heading": "2.

For example, in Fig. 1, u \u2208 R2 is distributed according to the \u2018ground truth\u2019 density function (top right). Let xj \u2208 Rd be a random vector, which represents the jth subject in the group (in Fig. 1, the jth scatter plot shows realizations of xj). We assume the additive model\nxj = u+ vj , (1)\nwhere {vj} are random vectors that are independent of u and represent subject-specific factors. Generally, each vj has a different distribution (had they been distributed identically, they would have been part of the common model).\nGiven realizations of xj , for j = 1 . . .m, our goal is to estimate statistical properties of the common component u.\nIn particular, we are interested in estimating either the covariance matrix \u03a3u or the full pdf pu of u.\nObviously, the performance in those estimation tasks will generally depend on both the number of subjects m and the number of samples per subject. However, here, we are interested in the common situation in which the number of samples per subject suffices to obtain reasonably accurate estimates for \u03a3xj or pxj (e.g., when the dimension d is relatively small). Our assumption is thus that the covariances (or pdfs) of the subjects xj are known and our focus is on the problem of recovering the common covariance (or pdf) from them. To apply our algorithms in practice, one has to plug in estimates of the covariances (or pdfs) of the subjects (obtained using, e.g., KDE)."}, {"heading": "3.

We would like to estimate the covariance matrix \u03a3u of the common component, given the covariance matrices {\u03a3xj} of the subjects. To avoid ambiguity, we define the common component \u03a3u to be the largest one satisfying such a decomposition. In particular, this means that the smallest eigenvalue of (at least some of) the subject-specific factors {\u03a3vj} must be arbitrarily small. Indeed, otherwise there would exist some \u03b1 > 0 such that \u03a3vj \u03b1I for every j so that \u03b1I would be common to all {\u03a3vj} and not subject-specific. In other words, the common component in this case is in fact \u03a3u + \u03b1I and the noise covariances are \u03a3vj \u2212 \u03b1I .\nLet us first informally describe the key idea underlying\nour method, and then provide a formal \u201cgroup consistency\u201d result.

Our assumption, which we formalize mathematically below, is that the subject-specific noise covariances \u03a3vj are diverse in the sense that their bottom eigenvectors tend to point in different directions. This, together with the fact their smallest eigenvalue can be arbitrarily small, implies that as the number of subjects grows, it becomes increasingly likely that for every direction q, at least one of the values {qT\u03a3vjq}mj=1 be small.

(18) Assumption (16) merely states that the noise factors are not arbitrarily large. Assumption (17) is a condition on the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue of \u03a3v and its associated eigenvector. Roughly speaking, it requires that there be a positive probability for the smallest eigenvalue to be arbitrarily small and, simultaneously, for the corresponding eigenvector to point in any direction (i.e., this eigenvector can have any distribution on the unit sphere as long as it does not vanish on a set of nonzero Lebesgue measure). Recall that the condition on the smallest eigenvalue is actually\npart of the definition of the common covariance estimation problem, and therefore not a limiting assumption.\nTo prove the theorem, let us denote \u03c8(q) , qT\u03a3uq, gj(q) , qT\u03a3vjq, and hm(q) , minj\u2208{1,...,m} gj(q). Note that \u03c8(q) is a deterministic function (as \u03a3u is deterministic) whereas {gj(q)} and {hm(q)} are sequences of random functions (as {\u03a3vj} are random). We will need the following lemmas (see proofs in the Supplementary).\nLemma 1. For every q, the sequence of random variables {hm(q)} converges to zero almost surely. Furthermore, for any sequence of vectors {qm}\u221em=1 that converges to some vector q\u2217, the sequence of random variables {hm(qm)} converges to zero almost surely.\nLemma 2. Let \u03c6(q) be a continuous bounded function on a compact set C, which achieves a strict global minimum at q\u2217 \u2208 C. Let {fn(q)}\u221en=1 be a sequence of continuous bounded nonnegative functions on C satisfying fn(q\u2217)\u2192 0, and let wn(q) = \u03c6(q) + fn(q). Then any sequence of the form qn \u2208 arg minq\u2208C wn(q) converges to q\u2217, and the sequence wn(qn) converges to \u03c6(q \u2217).\nproof of Theorem 1. For simplicity, we prove the theorem for d = 2. The extension to higher dimensions is similar.\nSince problem (11) is symmetric, we can divide the unit circle into two disjoint half circles A and B such that A is closed, and restrict the search for the minimum to A. Let us first assume that \u03bb1 6= \u03bb2. In this case, the minimum of \u03c8(q) over the unit circle is achieved at the points q1 and \u2212q1. Without loss of generality, we assume that q1 \u2208 A and \u2212q1 \u2208 B. The objective in (11) can be written as \u03c8(q) + hm(q). Since hm(q) is continuous for every m and hm(q1)\na.s.\u2192 0 (Lemma 1), the conditions of Lemma 2 hold a.s. Therefore, our estimate of the bottom eigenvector, q\u0302m1 , converges a.s. to the true eigenvector q1, namely\nq\u0302m1 a.s.\u2192 q1. (19)\nOur estimate (12) of the bottom eigenvalue, \u03bb\u0302m1 , can be written as \u03c8(q\u0302m1 ) + hm(q\u0302 m 1 ). Since q\u0302 m 1\na.s.\u2192 q1, we have from Lemma 1 that hm(q\u0302 m 1 ) a.s.\u2192 0, and therefore \u03bb\u0302m1 a.s.\u2192 \u03c8(q1) = \u03bb1 as well.\nThe top eigenvector is given by q2 = Rq1, where R is a 90\u25e6 rotation matrix, and our estimate of this eigenvector is simply q\u03022 = Rq\u03021. Therefore, (19) implies that also\nq\u0302m2 a.s.\u2192 q2. (20)\nThe convergence of \u03bb\u0302m2 to \u03bb2 follows similarly by Lemma 1.\nLet us now treat the case where \u03bb1 = \u03bb2. In this setting, the vectors q\u0302m1 , q\u0302 m 2 do not necessarily converge. However, for the matrix \u03a3\u0302 m\nu to converge to \u03a3u, it suffices that only\nthe eigenvalue estimates \u03bb\u0302m1 , \u03bb\u0302 m 2 converge to \u03bb1, \u03bb2 (in that case, the vectors q\u0302m1 , q\u0302 m 2 have no effect in (10)). To see that the eigenvalues converge, note that the solution of (12) is bounded from below by minq\u2208S1 \u03c8(q) = \u03bb1, because hm(q) \u2265 0. Additionally, we have that\n\u03bb\u0302m1 = min q\u2208S1 min j\u2208{1,...,m} qT\u03a3xjq\n= \u03bb1 + min q\u2208S1 hm(q) \u2264 \u03bb1 + hm(q\u0304) a.s.\u2192 \u03bb1, (21)\nwhere q\u0304 is an arbitrary point in S1, and the convergence is due to Lemma 1. Therefore \u03bb\u0302m1 converges to \u03bb1. Similar arguments can be invoked to show that \u03bb\u0302m2 converges to \u03bb2.\nSince the eigenvectors and eigenvalues converge, \u03a3\u0302 m\nu converges to \u03a3u, and the proof is complete."}, {"heading": "4.

This can be done by first estimating \u03a3u and then normalizing the offdiagonal entry by the square-roots of the diagonal entries. We compare our estimator (Alg. 1) with naive averaging of {\u03a3xj} using either Euclidean or Riemannian mean.\nWe generate the matrices {\u03a3vj} as\n\u03a3vj = M j\u039bjM T j , (27)\nwhereM j are random rotation matrices whose angles are distributed uniformly in [0, 2\u03c0], and \u039bj are random diagonal matrices \u039bj = diag{\u03b2j1, \u03b2 j 2} with \u03b2 j 1 \u223c U [0, b] and \u03b2j2 \u223c U [b, 2b] for some b > 0.

As can be seen, while the variance of our estimator is slightly larger than the variances of the naive estimators, its bias is significantly smaller. Therefore, overall, it attains a substantially lower mean square error. Figure 3 also indicates that our estimator is asymptotically (in the number of subjects) unbiased. The naive estimators, on the other hand, have severe biases, which do not decrease with the number of subjects. Figure 4 further illustrates that the performance of the naive\nestimators degrades rapidly as the SNR decreases, while our estimator remains relatively accurate even at low SNRs.\nIn this example, the poor performance of the naive estimators is mainly rooted in their over-estimation of the diagonal entries of \u03a3u.

As long as there exists a nonzero probability to encounter matrices away from the cluster, our algorithm is guaranteed to produce an accurate estimate as the number of subjects grows.

We removed nuisance variance (Lund, 2001; Fox et al., 2005), applied a temporal bandpass filter (0.009 Hz < f < 0.08 Hz) (Fox et al., 2005; Biswal et al., 1995; Cordes et al., 2001) and a spatial Gaussian filter (6mm FWHM), and removed linear trend from the extracted time-courses. We took the 458 control subjects from the published training set (for results on 141 subjects with ADHD, please see the Supplementary). From each subject, we extracted time-courses of 39 regions of interest (ROI) of the MSDL atlas (Varoquaux et al., 2011) and estimated their covariance using the Ledoit-Wolf estimator (Ledoit & Wolf, 2004). This gave us a 39\u00d7 39 covariance matrix per subject. We estimated the common covariance matrix using Alg. 1, using Geometric (Riemannian) mean (Varoquaux et al., 2010a), and using Euclidean mean. From the estimated covariances, we calculated correlation matrices. We used the nilearn and scikit-learn python packages\n(Abraham et al., 2014; Pedregosa et al., 2011; Buitinck et al., 2013). The running time of Alg. 1 was about 10s on an 8 core Intel i7-6700 with 16GB of RAM working at 3.40GHz. The results are depicted in Fig. 6.\nIt has been shown that estimates of connectivity patterns often vary significantly between subjects (Moussa et al., 2012). As can be seen in Fig. 6, our estimator detects activity within known networks despite the large variability between subjects. In particular, our estimator detects stronger correlations than the Euclidean and Riemannian mean estimators within the Default Mode Network, the Right Ventral Attention network, the Left Ventral Attention network, and the Cingulate Insula (connectivity between cingulate cortex and insula) (Moussa et al., 2012). Zoomed versions of those networks are shown in Fig. 7. Note that the Euclidean mean estimator shows very low correlations within some of those regions."}, {"heading": "5.4. Common density of PPG and ABP", "text": "In our last experiment, we used Alg. 2 to estimate the joint density function of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings. We used measurements from 25 subjects in critical care taken from the MIMIC 2 dataset (Kachuee et al., 2015). As a preprocessing step, we normalized the signals to have zero mean and unit variance.\nFor each subject, we then estimated the 2D pdf of ABP and PPG using Gaussian KDE with bandwidth 0.08. From the resulting 25 pdfs, we estimated the common pdf using Alg. 2. As can be seen in Fig. 8, our algorithm manages to reveal delicate structures in the common pdf, which are not seen when applying KDE on all the data from all the subjects. In the Supplementary, we show that these structures are not detected with naive KDE with any bandwidth. This illustrates again the ability of our approach to suppress subject-specific noise factors that have different distributions."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "We presented algorithms for estimating the covariance and the pdf of the common component of a group of subjects, when noise has a different distribution for each subject. Our algorithms take advantage of the diversity of the subjectspecific noise distributions in order to efficiently suppress them. In contrast to previous approaches, we did not assume any parametric model for the underlying distributions. We proved that under rather mild assumptions, our common covariance estimate tends to the covariance of the common component as the number of subjects grows. We presented experiments on simulated and on real data, which confirmed the advantages of our methods over alternative approaches."}], "year": 2018, "references": [{"title": "Machine learning for neuroimaging with scikit-learn", "authors": ["A.

Such analyses play important roles e.g., in detecting functional brain networks from fMRI scans and in identifying brain regions which show increased activity in response to certain stimuli. Group level techniques usually assume that all subjects in the group behave according to a single statistical model, or that deviations from the common model have simple parametric forms. Therefore, complex subject-specific deviations from the common model severely impair the performance of such methods. In this paper, we propose nonparametric algorithms for estimating the common covariance matrix and the common density function of several variables in a heterogeneous group of subjects. Our estimates converge to the true model as the number of subjects tends to infinity, under very mild conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methods through extensive simulations as well as on real-data from fMRI scans and from arterial blood pressure and photoplethysmogram measurements.", "title": "Revealing Common Statistical Behaviors in Heterogeneous Populations"}
