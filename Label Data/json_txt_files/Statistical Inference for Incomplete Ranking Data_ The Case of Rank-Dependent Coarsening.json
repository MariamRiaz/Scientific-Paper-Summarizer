Introduction", "text": "The analysis of rank data has a long tradition in statistics, and corresponding methods have been used in various fields of application, such as psychology and the social sciences (Marden, 1995). More recently, applications in information retrieval and machine learning have caused a renewed interest in the analysis of rankings and topics such as \u201clearningto-rank\u201d (Liu, 2011) and preference learning (Fu\u0308rnkranz & Hu\u0308llermeier, 2011).\nIn most applications, the rankings observed are incomplete or partial in the sense of including only a subset of the underlying choice alternatives (subsequently referred to as\n1Paderborn University, Germany 2University of Oviedo, Spain.

Somewhat surprisingly, most methods for learning from ranking data, including methods for rank aggregation, simply ignore the process of turning a full ranking into an incomplete one. Or, they implicitly assume that the process is unimportant from a statistical point of view, because the subset of items observed is independent of the underlying ranking.\nObviously, this assumption is often not valid, as shown by practically relevant examples such as top-k observations. Motivated by examples of this kind, we propose the concept of rank-dependent coarsening, which assumes that incomplete rankings are produced by projecting a full ranking to a random subset of ranks. The notion of \u201ccoarsening\u201d is meant to indicate that an incomplete ranking can be associated with a set of complete rankings, namely the set of its consistent extensions\u2014set-valued data of that kind is also called \u201ccoarse data\u201d in statistics (Heitjan & Rubin, 1991; Gill et al., 1997). The idea of coarsening is similar to the interpretation of partial rankings as \u201ccensored data\u201d (Lebanon & Mao, 2008). The assumption of rank-dependent coarsening can be seen as orthogonal to standard marginalization, which acts on items instead of ranks (Rajkumar & Agarwal, 2014; Sibony et al., 2015).\nIn addition to introducing a general statistical framework for analyzing incomplete ranking data (Section 3), we outline several problems and learning tasks to be addressed in this framework. Learning of the entire model will normally not be feasible, even under restrictive assumptions on the coarsening. A specifically interesting question, therefore, is to what extent and in what sense successful learning is possible for methods that are agnostic of the coarsening process. We investigate this question, both practically (Section 6) and theoretically (Section 7), for several ranking methods (Section 5) and a concrete instantiation of our framework, in which full rankings are drawn from a Plackett-Luce distribution and observations take the form of pairwise preferences (Section 4). In particular, we are interested in the property of consistency, by which we mean the ability to recover a target ranking when the sample size goes to infinity, despite a potential bias in the observations caused by the coarsening."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries and Notation", "text": "Let SK denote the collection of rankings (permutations) over a set U = {a1, . . . , aK} of K items ak, k \u2208 [K] = {1, . . . ,K}. We denote by \u03c0 : [K] \u2212\u2192 [K] a complete ranking (a generic element of SK), where \u03c0(k) denotes the position of the kth item ak in the ranking, and by \u03c0\u22121 the ordering associated with a ranking, i.e., \u03c0\u22121(j) is the index of the item on position j. We write rankings in brackets and orderings in parentheses; for example, \u03c0 = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5] and \u03c0\u22121 = (4, 1, 3, 2, 5) both denote the ranking a4 a1 a3 a2 a5.\nFor a possibly incomplete ranking, which includes only some of the items, we use the symbol \u03c4 (instead of \u03c0). If the kth item does not occur in a ranking, then \u03c4(k) = 0 by definition; otherwise, \u03c4(k) is the rank of the kth item. In the corresponding ordering, the missing items do simply not occur. For example, the ranking a4 a1 a2 would be encoded as \u03c4 = [2, 3, 0, 1] and \u03c4\u22121 = (4, 1, 2), respectively. We let I(\u03c4) = {k : \u03c4(k) > 0} \u2282 [K] and denote the set of all rankings (complete or incomplete) by SK .\nAn incomplete ranking \u03c4 can be associated with its set of linear extensions E(\u03c4) \u2282 SK , where \u03c0 \u2208 E(\u03c4) if \u03c0 is consistent with the order of items in I(\u03c4), i.e., (\u03c4(i) \u2212 \u03c4(j))(\u03c0(i) \u2212 \u03c0(j)) \u2265 0 for all i, j \u2208 I(\u03c4). An important special case is an incomplete ranking \u03c4 = \u03c4i,j = (i, j) in the form of a pairwise comparison ai aj (i.e., \u03c4(i) = 1, \u03c4(j) = 2, \u03c4(k) = 0 otherwise), which is associated with the set of extensions\nE(\u03c4) = E(ai aj) = {\u03c0 \u2208 SK : \u03c0(i) < \u03c0(j)} .\nModeling an incomplete observation \u03c4 by the set of linear extensions E(\u03c4) reflects the idea that \u03c4 has been produced from an underlying complete ranking \u03c0 by some \u201ccoarsening\u201d or \u201cimprecisiation\u201d process, which essentially consists of omitting some of the items from the ranking. E(\u03c4) then corresponds to the set of all consistent extension \u03c0 if nothing is known about the coarsening, except that it does not change the relative order of any items."}, {"heading": "3. General Setting and Problems", "text": "The type of data we assume as observations is incomplete rankings \u03c4 \u2208 SK . Statistical inference for this type of data requires a probabilistic model of the underlying data generating process, that is, a probability distribution on SK ."}, {"heading": "3.1. A Stochastic Model for Incomplete Rankings", "text": "Recalling our idea of a coarsening process, it is natural to consider the data generating process as a two step procedure, in which a full ranking \u03c0 is generated first and turned into an incomplete ranking \u03c4 afterward. We model this assumption in terms of a distribution on SK \u00d7 SK , which assigns a\ndegree of probability to each pair (\u03c4, \u03c0). More specifically, we assume a parameterized distribution of the following form: p\u03b8,\u03bb(\u03c4, \u03c0) = p\u03b8(\u03c0) \u00b7 p\u03bb(\u03c4 |\u03c0) (1) Thus, while the generation of full rankings is determined by the distribution\np\u03b8 : SK \u2212\u2192 [0, 1] , (2)\nthe coarsening process is specified by a family of conditional probability distributions{\np\u03bb(\u00b7 |\u03c0) : \u03c0 \u2208 SK , \u03bb \u2208 \u039b } , (3)\nwhere \u03bb collects all parameters of these distributions; p\u03b8,\u03bb(\u03c4, \u03c0) is the probability of producing the data (\u03c4, \u03c0) \u2208 SK \u00d7 SK . Note, however, that \u03c0 is actually not observed."}, {"heading": "3.1.1. RANK-DEPENDENT COARSENING", "text": "In its most general form, the coarsening process (3) is extremely rich, even if being restricted by the consistency assumption p\u03bb(\u03c4 |\u03c0) = 0 for \u03c0 6\u2208 E(\u03c4). In fact, since the number of probabilities to be specified is of the order 2KK!, inference about \u03bb will generally be difficult. Therefore, p\u03bb certainly needs to be restricted by further assumptions. Apart from practical reasons, such assumptions are also indispensable for successful learning. Otherwise, observations could be arbitrarily biased in favor or disfavor of items, so that an estimation of the underlying (full) preferences, as reflected by p\u03b8, becomes completely impossible. For example, the coarsening process may leave a ranking \u03c0 unchanged whenever item a1 is on the last position, and remove a1 from \u03c0 otherwise. Obviously, this item will then appear to have a very low preference.\nAs shown by this example, the estimation of preferences will generally be impossible unless the coarsening is somehow more \u201cneutral\u201d. The assumption we make here is a property we call rank-dependent coarsening. A coarsening procedure is rank-dependent if the incompletion is only acting on ranks (positions) but not on items. That is, the procedure randomly selects a subset of ranks and removes the items on these ranks, independently of the items themselves. In other words, an incomplete observation \u03c4 is obtained by projecting a complete ranking \u03c0 on a random subset of positions A \u2208 2[K], i.e., the family (3) of distributions p\u03bb(\u00b7 |\u03c0) is specified by a single measure on 2[K]. Or, stated more formally,\np ( \u03c0\u22121(A) |\u03c0\u22121 ) = p ( \u03c3\u22121(A) |\u03c3\u22121 ) for all \u03c0, \u03c3 \u2208 SK and A \u2282 [K], where \u03c0\u22121(A) denotes the projection of the ordering \u03c0\u22121 to the positions in A.\nThe assumption of rank-dependent coarsening can be seen as orthogonal to standard marginalization: while the latter projects a full ranking to a subset of items, the former\nprojects a ranking to a subset of positions. The practically relevant case of top-k observations is a special (degenerate) case of rank-dependent coarsening, in which\np(A) = { 1 if A = {1, . . . , k} 0 otherwise\nThis model could be weakened in various ways. For example, instead of fixing the length of observed rankings to a constant, k could be a random variable. Or, one could assume that positions are discarded with increasing probability, though independently of each other; thus, the probability to observe a subset of items on ranks A \u2286 {1, . . . ,K} is given by\nP (A) = \u220f i\u2208A \u03bbi \u00b7 \u220f j 6\u2208A (1\u2212 \u03bbj) .\nThe coarsening is then defined by the K parameters \u03bb1 > \u03bb2 > . . . > \u03bbK ."}, {"heading": "3.2. Learning Tasks", "text": "Suppose a sample of (training) data D = {\u03c41, . . . , \u03c4N} to be given. As for statistical inference about the process (1), several problems could be tackled.\n\u2022 The most obvious problem is to estimate the complete distribution on SK , i.e., the parameters \u03b8 and \u03bb. As already explained before, this will require specific assumptions about the coarsening.\n\u2022 A somewhat weaker goal is to estimate the \u201cprecise part\u201d, i.e., the parameter \u03b8. Indeed, in many cases, \u03b8 will be the relevant part of the model, as it specifies the preferences on items, whereas the coarsening is rather considered as a complication of the estimation. In this case, \u03bb is of interest only in so far as it helps to estimate \u03b8. Ideally, it would even be possible to estimate \u03b8 without any inference about \u03bb, i.e., by simply ignoring the coarsening process.\n\u2022 An even weaker goal is to estimate, not the parameter \u03b8 itself, but only an underlying \u201cground truth\u201d ranking \u03c0\u2217\nassociated with \u03b8. Indeed, in the context of learning to rank, the ultimate goal is typically to predict a ranking, not necessarily a complete distribution. For example, the ranking \u03c0\u2217 could be the mode of the distribution p\u03b8, or any other sort of representative statistics. This problem is especially relevant in practical applications such as rank aggregation, in which \u03c0\u2217 would play the role of a consensus ranking.\nHere, we are mainly interested in the third problem, i.e., the estimation of a ground-truth ranking \u03c0\u2217. Moreover, due to reasons of efficiency, we are aiming for an estimation technique that circumvents direct inference about \u03bb, while\nbeing robust in the sense of producing reasonably good results for a wide range of coarsening procedures."}, {"heading": "4. Specific Setting and Problems", "text": "The development and analysis of methods is only possible for concrete instantiations of the setting introduced in the previous section. An instantiation of that kind will be proposed in this section. The first part of our data generating process, p\u03b8, will be modeled by the Plackett-Luce model (Plackett, 1975; Luce, 1959). To make the second part, p\u03bb, manageable, we restrict observations to the practically relevant case of pairwise comparisons (i.e., incomplete rankings of length 2)."}, {"heading": "4.1.

Each \u03b8i can be interpreted as the weight or \u201cstrength\u201d of the option ai.

Consequently, \u03b8 can be normalized without loss of generality (and the number of degrees of freedom is only K \u2212 1 instead of K). Note that the most probable ranking, i.e., the mode of the PL distribution, is simply obtained by sorting the items in decreasing order of their weight:\n\u03c0\u2217 = arg max \u03c0\u2208SK pl\u03b8(\u03c0) = arg sort k\u2208[K] {\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8K} .

Starting from a formalization in terms of a graph whose nodes correspond to the items and whose edges are labeled with the weighted preferences, the weighted feedback arc set problem (Saab, 2001; Fomin et al., 2010) is to find the ranking that causes the lowest sum of penalties:\n\u03c0\u0302 = arg min \u03c0\u2208SK \u2211 (i,j):\u03c0(i)<\u03c0(j) cj,i\nFor the same reason as in the case of BTL, we also consider the FAS problem with edge weights given by relative winning frequencies p\u0302i,j and binary preferences I(p\u0302i,j > 1/2) instead of absolute frequencies ci,j ; we call the former approach FAS(R) and the latter FAS(B)."}, {"heading": "5.5. Pairwise Coupling", "text": "A common approach to multi-class classification is the allpairs decomposition, in which one binary classifier hi,j is trained for each pair of classes ai and aj (Fu\u0308rnkranz, 2002). At prediction time, each classifier produces a prediction, which can be interpreted as a vote, or weighted vote p\u0302i,j in case of a probabilistic classifier, in favor of item ai over aj . The problem of combining these predictions into an overall prediction for the multi-class problem is also called pairwise coupling (Hastie & Tibshirani, 1998).\nTo the best of our knowledge, pairwise coupling has not been used for rank aggregation so far. In fact, the original purpose of this technique is not to rank items but merely to identify a single winner. Nevertheless, since coupling methods are eventually based on scoring items, they can be generalized for the purpose of ranking in a straightforward way. Indeed, they have been used for that purpose in the context of label ranking (Hu\u0308llermeier et al., 2008)."}, {"heading": "5.5.1.

As a baseline, we also produced the performance of each method for the case of full pairwise information about a ranking, i.e., adding all pairwise preferences to the data (instead of only a\u03c0\u22121(i) a\u03c0\u22121(j)) that can be extracted from a ranking \u03c0.\nDue to space restrictions, the results are only shown in the supplementary material. The following observations can be made:\n\u2022 Comparing the results for learning from incomplete data with the baseline, it is obvious that coarsening comes with a loss of information and makes learning more difficult.\n\u2022 The difficulty of the learning task increases with decreasing distance |i\u2212 j| between observed ranks and is most challenging for the case of observing neighboring ranks (i, i+ 1).\n\u2022 All methods perform rather well, although FAS is visibly worse while BTL is a bit better than the others. On the one side, this could be explained by the fact that the BTL model is consistent with the PL model, as it corresponds to the marginals of p\u03b8. On the other side, like all other methods, BTL is agnostic of the coarsening p\u03bb; from this point of view, the strong performance is indeed a bit surprising. As a side remark, BTL(R) does not improve on BTL.\n\u2022 While FAS is on a par with FAS(R), FAS(B) tends to do slightly better, especially for a larger number of items. However, as already said, FAS performs generally worse than the others.\nIn another set of experiments, we examined the averaged performance of methods over all coarsening positions. The results are again shown in the supplementary material. It is noticeable that, as the number of items increases, the performance of the FAS-based approaches decreases.

MALLOWS DISTRIBUTION", "text": "In a second series of experiments, we replaced the PL distribution with another well-known distribution on rankings, namely the Mallows distribution. Thus, data is now generated with p\u03b8 in (1) given by Mallows instead of PL. This experiment serves as a kind of sensitivity analysis, especially for those methods that (explicitly or implicitly) rely on the assumption of PL.\nThe Mallows model (Mallows, 1957) is parametrized by a reference ranking \u03c0\u2217 (which is the mode) and a dispersion\nparameter \u03c6, i.e., \u03b8 = (\u03c0\u2217, \u03c6):\np\u03c0\u2217,\u03c6(\u03c0) = 1\nZ(\u03c6) exp\n( \u2212 \u03c6D(\u03c0, \u03c0\u2217) ) ,\nwhere D(\u03c0, \u03c0\u2217) is the Kendall distance and Z(\u03c6) a normalization constant.\nThe results and observations for this series of experiments are quite similar to those for the PL model. What is notable, however, is a visible drop in performance for BTL, whereas Copeland ranking now performs much better than all other algorithms. Furthermore, FAS(B) is significantly better than FAS and FAS(R). These results might be explained by the ordinal nature of the Mallows model, which is arguably better fit by methods based on binary comparisons than by score-based approaches."}, {"heading": "6.2. Real Data", "text": "To compare the methods on a real world data set, we used the Sushi data (Kamishima, 2003) that contains the preferences (full rankings) of 5000 people over 10 types of sushi.\nFor this data set, there is no obvious ground truth \u03c0\u2217. There-\nfore, we define a separate target for each data set individually, which is the ranking produced by that method on the full set of pairwise comparisons that can be extracted from the training data. The distance between this ranking and the one predicted for coarsened data can essentially be seen as a measure of the loss of information caused by coarsening. We conduct this experiment for (a) degenerate coarsening where \u03bbi,j = 1 for some (i, j) and (b) random coarsening where \u03bbi,j = 2/(K2 \u2212K) for all (i, j). Note that, while the information content is the same in both cases (one pairwise comparison per customer), random coarsening does not introduce any bias, as opposed to degenerate coarsening.\nThe results (distributions for 100 repetitions) are shown in Figure 1. Again, all methods are more or less on a par. However, as expected, random coarsening does indeed lead to better estimates, again suggesting that \u201creal\u201d coarsening indeed makes learning harder."}, {"heading": "7. Consistency", "text": "Recall the (specific) setting we introduced in Section 4, in which full rankings are generated according to a PL model with parameter \u03b8 = (\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8K), and the coarsening corresponds to a projection to a random pair of ranks; for technical reasons, we subsequently assume \u03b8i 6= \u03b8j for i 6= j. Also recall that we denote by pi,j the probability of a ranking \u03c0 in which ai precedes aj , and by qi,j the probability to observe the preference ai aj after coarsening. According to PL, we have pi,j = \u03b8i/(\u03b8i + \u03b8j), and the ground truth ranking \u03c0\u2217 is such that\n(\u03c0(i) < \u03c0(j)) \u21d4 (\u03b8i > \u03b8j) \u21d4 (pi,j > 1/2)\nFinally, we denote by p\u0302i,j the estimate of the pairwise preference (probability) pi,j . If not stated differently, we always assume estimates to be given by relative frequencies, i.e., p\u0302i,j = wi,j/(wi,j + wj,i), with wi,j the observed number of preferences ai aj .\nDefinition 1: Let \u03c0\u0302N denote the ranking produced as a prediction by a ranking method on the basis of N observed (pairwise) preferences. The method is consistent if p(\u03c0\u0302N = \u03c0\u2217)\u2192 1 for N \u2192\u221e.\nThe proofs of the following results are given in the supplementary material.\nLemma 2: Let us consider a probability measure p\u03b8 over SK . Consider qi,j = \u2211 \u03c0\u2208E(ai aj) p\u03b8(\u03c0)\u03bb\u03c0(i),\u03c0(j), \u2200 i 6= j. (The model (8) with p\u03b8(\u03c0) not necessarily PL). If p\u03b8(\u03c0) \u2265 p\u03b8(\u03c0i,j) for all \u03c0 \u2208 E(ai aj), then qi,j > qj,i.\nLemma 3: Assume the model (8), \u03b8i 6= \u03b8j for i 6= j, and \u03b8i > 0 for all i \u2208 [K]. The coarsening (7) is orderpreserving for PL in the sense that pi,j > 1/2 if and only if q\u2032i,j > 1/2, where q \u2032 i,j = qi,j/(qi,j + qj,i).\nThe last result is indeed remarkable: Although coarsening will bias the pairwise probabilities pi,j , the \u201cbinary\u201d preferences will be preserved in the sense that sign(pi,j \u2212 1/2) = sign(q\u2032i,j \u2212 1/2). Indeed, the result heavily exploits properties of the PL distribution and does not hold in general. For example, consider a distribution p on S3 such that p([1, 2, 3]) = 0.8, p([3, 1, 2]) = p([3, 2, 1]) = 0.1. Then, with a coarsening (7) such that \u03bb2,3 = 1, we have p1,2 = p1,3 = 0.8, but q\u20321,2 = q \u2032 1,3 = 0.\nLemma 4: Assume the model (8), \u03b8i 6= \u03b8j for i 6= j, and \u03b8i > 0 for all i \u2208 [K]. Let us take an arbitrarily small \u2217 > 0. There exists N0 \u2208 N such that \u03b8i > \u03b8j if and only if p\u0302i,j > 1/2 for all i, j \u2208 [K], with probability at least 1\u2212 \u2217, after having observed at least N0 preferences.\nTheorem 5: Copeland ranking is consistent.\nTheorem 6: FAS, FAS(R), and FAS(B) are consistent.\nOur experimental results so far suggest that consistency does not only hold for Copeland and FAS, but also for most other methods (including BTL), and hence that rank-dependent coarsening is indeed somehow \u201cgood-natured\u201d. Anyway, for these cases, the proofs are still pending."}, {"heading": "8. Summary and Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we addressed the problem of learning from incomplete ranking data and advocated an explicit consideration of the process of turning a full ranking into an incomplete one\u2014a step that we referred to as \u201ccoarsening\u201d. To this end, we proposed a suitable probabilistic model and introduced the property of rank-dependent coarsening, which can be seen as orthogonal to standard marginalization: while the latter projects a ranking to a subset of items, the former projects to a subset of ranks.\nFirst experimental and theoretical results suggest that agnostic learning can be successful under rank-dependent coarsening: even if ignorance of the coarsening may lead to biased parameter estimates, the ranking task itself can still be solved properly. This applies at least to the specific setting that we considered, namely rank aggregation based on pairwise preferences, with Plackett-Luce (or Mallows) as an underlying distribution.\nNeedless to say, this paper is only a first step. Many questions are still open, for example regarding the consistency of ranking methods, not only for the specific setting considered here but even more so for generalizations thereof. In addition to theoretical problems of that kind, we are also interested in practical applications such as \u201ccrowdordering\u201d (Matsui et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2013), in which coarsening could play an important role."}], "year": 2017, "references": [{"title": "\u0307The rank analysis of incomplete block designs I", "authors": ["R.A.
