1	22	These research documents constitute valuable resources from the perspective of data mining applications.
2	54	For instance, the citation links among research documents are used in computing bibliometric quantities for authors (Alonso et al., 2009) whereas topic models on research corpora are used to distinguish between influential and impactful researchers (Kataria et al., 2011) and to capture temporal topic trends (He et al., 2009).

11	10	Organization: We describe our novel venue representations and the measures used to compare them in Section 2.
17	34	k, the multinomial distribution over the topics associated with d. The venue-topic probability distribution P (ti|vy) for a given (venue, year) pair (v = l, y = m) can be computed using Dl,m, the set of documents published in venue l, in the year m. That is, Pl,m(ti) = 1 |Dl,m| ∑ d∈Dl,m P (ti|d) (1) Note that the above probabilistic representation facilitates a quantitative measure to compare two venues: the divergence between the probability distributions of the two venues.
19	12	Due to the unsymmetric nature of KLD, we use the Jensen-Shannon divergence, a symmetric and finite measure (0 ≤ JSD(P ||Q) ≤ 1) based on KLD.
28	14	The TPICP vector for a venue is defined as: [TP (1) × ICP (1), .

34	38	However, research documents are often well-structured, and contain various sections with author information, citations, and content-related sections such as abstract, related work, and experiments.
35	24	To best represent the topical content of these documents, we harness the latest work on keyphrase extraction for research documents and represent documents using keyphrases (Hasan and Ng, 2014).
36	23	We use the ExpandRank algorithm (Wan and Xiao, 2008) to extract top n-grams ∀d ∈ D. ExpandRank effectively combines PageRank values on word graphs with text similarity scores between documents to score n-grams for a document and was shown to outperform other unsupervised keyphrase extraction methods on research documents in absence of other information such as citations (Gollapalli and Caragea, 2014).
38	18	The text from the PDF documents was extracted using the PDFBox software4 after which simple rules similar to the ones used in CiteSeer (Li et al., 2006) were employed to extract the “body” of the research document5.
40	14	From these numbers, 2 Since our goal is to compare the two venues, we start from 1996 when EMNLP branched off into a full conference from a workshop on Very Large Corpora although ACL proceedings are available from 1979.
43	9	We construct the keyphrase-document matrix using top-100 keyphrases of each document extracted with ExpandRank.
44	8	The LDA implementation provided in Mallet (McCallum, 2002) was used to extract topics from this matrix.
48	15	The top phrases that reflect the “theme” captured by a topic are shown in Table 1.
49	18	As indicated in this table, we are able to extract coherent topics from the corpus using LDA on a documentkeyphrase matrix (AlSumait et al., 2009; Newman et al., 2010).
51	28	We rank the topics in each conference by their TP-ICP values and list the top 3 topics in the right table of Figure 1.
52	27	“Semantic relation extraction”, “sentiment analysis”, and “topic models” are the top research topics in NLP last year (2014) whereas in the year 1996, the topics “noun phrase extraction”, “summarization”, “corpus modeling”, and “speech recognition” dominated the NLP research arena.
53	153	From the table, it can be seen that “information retrieval” (topicID: 18) ranks among the top topics in EMNLP for all three timepoints during 2000-2010 whereas “natural language generation” (topicID: 9) was consistently addressed during 1996-2005 in ACL.
55	56	The plot shows decreasing divergence between the topical distributions over the years and increasing cosine similarity between the TP-ICP vectors for the venues.
56	15	These trends indicate that over the two decades the two venues ACL and EMNLP seem to have “become like each other” although their topical focus was different during the initial years.
57	92	Increasingly, both venues seem to publish papers on similar top- ics.
58	62	This behavior could be interpreted to mean that the NLP research field is more stable now with two of its leading conferences addressing problems on similar topics.
59	9	Changing topical focus over the years: In the first plot of Figure 2, we show the JensenShannon divergence between the topic distributions of a particular venue for a given year y and (y − 1), the year preceding it.
61	55	We split the time period 1996-2014 into five roughly-equal parts to form the set {1996, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014}.
63	13	For example, the first cluster in the middle plot, shows the JSD values between the distributions for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014 with the starting year 1996 for ACL.
64	112	For both venues, the divergences of a given year are higher with the early starting years 1996 and 2000 than with the later starting years 2005 and 2010, indicating that the topics being addressed currently in NLP research are significantly different from those addressed a decade back.
73	25	We extracted coherent topics from this corpus by applying topic modeling on the corresponding keyphrase-document matrix.
