"Networks are ubiquitous, with prominent examples including social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) or citation networks of research papers (e.g., arXiv).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"When analyzing data from these real-world networks, traditional methods often represent vertices (nodes) as one-hot representations (containing the connectivity information of each vertex with respect to all other vertices), usually suffering from issues related to the inherent sparsity of large-scale networks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This results in models that are not able to fully capture the relationships between vertices of the network (Perozzi et al., 2014; Tu et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, network embedding (i.e., network representation learning) has been considered, representing each vertex of a network with a low-dimensional vector that preserves information on its similarity rel-
ative to other vertices.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This approach has attracted considerable attention in recent years (Tang and Liu, 2009; Perozzi et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015; Grover and Leskovec, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2018).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Traditional network embedding approaches focus primarily on learning representations of vertices that preserve local structure, as well as internal structural properties of the network.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), LINE (Tang et al., 2015), and Grarep (Cao et al., 2015) were proposed to preserve first-, second-, and higher-order proximity between nodes, respectively.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), which learns vertex representations from random-walk sequences, similarly, only takes into account structural information of the network.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, in realworld networks, vertices usually contain rich textual information (e.g., user profiles in Facebook, paper abstracts in arXiv, user-generated content on Twitter, etc.), which may be leveraged effectively for learning more informative embeddings.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To address this opportunity, Yang et al. (2015) proposed text-associated DeepWalk, to incorporate textual information into the vectorial representations of vertices (embeddings).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Sun et al. (2016) employed deep recurrent neural networks to integrate the information from vertex-
associated text into network representations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Further, Tu et al. (2017) proposed to more effectively model the semantic relationships between vertices using a mutual attention mechanism.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although these methods have demonstrated performance gains over structure-only network embeddings, the relationship between text sequences for a pair of vertices is accounted for solely by comparing their sentence embeddings.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, as shown in Figure 1, to assess the similarity between two research papers, a more effective strategy would compare and align (via localweighting) individual important words (keywords) within a pair of abstracts, while information from other words (e.g., stop words) that tend to be less relevant can be effectively ignored (downweighted).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This alignment mechanism is difficult to accomplish in models where text sequences are first embedded into a common space and then compared in pairs (He and Lin, 2016; Parikh et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2017; Wang et al., 2017b; Shen et al., 2018a).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We propose to learn a semantic-aware Network Embedding (NE) that incorporates wordlevel alignment features abstracted from text sequences associated with vertex pairs.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given a pair of sentences, our model first aligns each word within one sentence with keywords from the other sentence (adaptively up-weighted via an attention mechanism), producing a set of fine-grained matching vectors.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These features are then accumulated via a simple but efficient aggregation function, obtaining the final representation for the sentence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, the word-by-word alignment features (as illustrated in Figure 1) are explicitly and effectively captured by our model.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Further, the learned network embeddings under our framework are adaptive to the specific (local) vertices that are considered, and thus are context-aware and especially suitable for downstream tasks, such as link prediction.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, since the word-by-word matching procedure introduced here is highly parallelizable and does not require any complex encoding networks, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our framework requires significantly less time for training, which is attractive for large-scale network applications.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets spanning distinct network-embeddingbased applications: link prediction, vertex classi-
fication and visualization.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that the proposed word-by-word alignment mechanism efficiently incorporates textual information into the network embedding, and consistently exhibits superior performance relative to several competitive baselines.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Analyses considering the extracted word-by-word pairs further validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A network (graph) is defined as G = {V ,E}, where V and E denote the set of N vertices (nodes) and edges, respectively, where elements of E are two-element subsets of V .",2.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Here we only consider undirected networks, however, our approach (introduced below) can be readily extended to the directed case.",2.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"We also define W , the symmetric RN×N matrix whose elements,wij , denote the weights associated with edges in V , and T , the set of text sequences assigned to each vertex.",2.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Edges and weights contain the structural information of the network, while the text can be used to characterize the semantic properties of each vertex.",2.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Given network G, with the network embedding we seek to encode each vertex into a low-dimensional vector h (with dimension much smaller than N ), while preserving structural and semantic features of G.",2.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"To incorporate both structural and semantic information into the network embeddings, we specify two types of (latent) embeddings: (i) hs, the structural embedding; and (ii) ht, the textual embedding.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"Specifically, each vertex in G is encoded into a low-dimensional embedding h =",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
[hs;ht].,2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"To learn these embeddings, we specify an objective that leverages the information from both W and T , denoted as
L = ∑ e∈E Lstruct(e) + Ltext(e) + Ljoint(e) , (1)
where Lstruct, Ltext and Ljoint denote structure, text, and joint structure-text training losses, respectively.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"For a vertex pair {vi, vj} weighted by wij , Lstruct(vi, vj) in (1) is defined as (Tang et al., 2015)
Lstruct(vi, vj) = wij log p(his|hjs) , (2)
where p(his|hjs) denotes the conditional probability between structural embeddings for vertices {vi, vj}.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"To leverage the textual information in T , similar text-specific and joint structure-text training objectives are also defined
Ltext(vi, vj) = wijα1 log p(hit|h j t ) , (3)
Ljoint(vi, vj) =",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
wijα2 log p(hit|hjs) (4) + wijα3 log p(h,2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"i s|h j t ) , (5)
where p(hit|h j t ) and p(h i t|hjs) (or p(his|h j t ))",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"denote the conditional probability for a pair of text embeddings and text embedding given structure embedding (or vice versa), respectively, for vertices {vi, vj}.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"Further, α1, α2 and α3 are hyperparameters that balance the impact of the different training-loss components.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"Note that structural embeddings, hs, are treated directly as parameters, while the text embeddings ht are learned based on the text sequences associated with vertices.
",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"For all conditional probability terms, we follow Tang et al. (2015) and consider the second-order proximity between vertex pairs.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"Thus, for vertices {vi, vj}, the probability of generating hi conditioned on hj may be written as
p(hi|hj) = exp
( hj T hi )
∑N k=1 exp ( hj T hk ) .",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"(6)
Note that (6) can be applied to both structural and text embeddings in (2) and (3).
",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"Inspired by Tu et al. (2017), we further assume that vertices in the network play different roles depending on the vertex with which they interact.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"Thus, for a given vertex, the text embedding, ht, is adaptive (specific) to the vertex it is being conditioned on.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"This type of contextaware textual embedding has demonstrated superior performance relative to context-free embeddings (Tu et al., 2017).",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"In the following two sections, we describe our strategy for encoding the text sequence associated with an edge into its adaptive textual embedding, via word-by-context and word-by-word alignments.",2.2 Framework Overview,[0],[0]
"We first introduce our base model, which reweights the importance of individual words within a text sequence in the context of the edge being considered.",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"Consider text sequences associated with two vertices connected by an edge, de-
noted ta and tb and contained in T .",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"Text sequences ta and tb are of lengths Ma and Mb, respectively, and are represented by Xa ∈ Rd×Ma",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"and Xb ∈ Rd×Mb , respectively, where d is the dimension of the word embedding.",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"Further, x(i)a denotes the embedding of the i-th word in sequence ta.
",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
Our goal is to encode text sequences ta and tb into counterpart-aware vectorial representations ha and hb.,2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"Thus, while inferring the adaptive textual embedding for sentence ta, we propose reweighting the importance of each word in ta to explicitly account for its alignment with sentence tb.",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"The weight αi, corresponding to the i-th word in ta, is generated as:
αi = exp(tanh(W1cb",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
+W2x (i) a )),2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"∑Ma
j=1 exp(tanh(W1cb",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
+,2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"W2x (j) a ))
, (7)
where W1 and W2 are model parameters and cb = ∑Mb i=1",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"x b i is the context vector of sequence tb, obtained by simply averaging over all the word embeddings in the sequence, similar to fastText (Joulin et al., 2016).",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"Further, the word-by-context embedding for sequence ta is obtained by taking the weighted average over all word embeddings
ha = ∑Ma i=1αix (i) a .",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"(8)
Intuitively, αi may be understood as the relevance score between the ith word in ta and sequence tb.",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"Specifically, keywords within ta, in the context of tb, should be assigned larger weights, while less important words will be correspondingly downweighted.",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"Similarly, hb is encoded as a weighted embedding using (7) and (8).",2.3 Word-by-Context Alignment,[0],[0]
"With the alignment in the previous section, wordby-context matching features αi are modeled; however, the word-by-word alignment information (fine-grained), which is key to characterize the relationship between two vertices (as discussed in the above), is not explicitly captured.",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"So motivated, we further propose an architecture to explicitly abstract word-by-word alignment information from ta and tb, to learn the relationship between the two vertices.",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"This is inspired by the recent success of Relation Networks (RNs) for relational reasoning (Santoro et al., 2017).
",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"As illustrated in Figure 2, given two input embedding matrices Xa and Xb, we first compute the affinity matrix A ∈ RMb×Ma , whose elements represent the affinity scores corresponding to all word pairs between sequences ta and tb
A = XTb Xa .",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"(9)
Subsequently, we compute the context-aware matrix for sequence tb as
Ab = softmax(A) , X̃b = XbAb , (10)
where the softmax(·) function is applied columnwise to A, and thus Ab contains the attention weights (importance scores) across sequence tb (columns), which account for each word in sequence ta (rows).",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Thus, matrix X̃b ∈ Rd×Ma in (10) constitutes an attention-weighted embedding for Xb.",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Specifically, the i-th column of X̃b, denoted as x̃(i)b , can be understood as a weighted average over all the words in tb, where higher attention weights indicate better alignment (match) with the i-th word in ta.
",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"To abstract the word-by-word alignments, we compare x(i)a with x̃ (i) b , for i = 1, 2, ...,Ma, to obtain the corresponding matching vector
m(i)a = falign ( x(i)a , x̃ (i) b ) , (11)
where falign(·) represents the alignment function.",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Inspired by the observation in Wang and Jiang (2017) that simple comparison/alignment functions based on element-wise operations exhibit excellent performance in matching text sequences, here we use a combination of element-wise subtraction and multiplication as
falign(x (i) a , x̃ (i) a ) =",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"[x (i) a − x̃ (i) a ;x (i) a x̃ (i) a ] ,
where denotes the element-wise Hadamard product, then these two operations are concatenated to produce the matching vector m(i)a .",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Note these operators may be used individually or combined as we will investigate in our experiments.
",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Subsequently, matching vectors from (11) are aggregated to produce the final textual embedding hat for sequence ta as
hat = faggregate ( m(1)a ,m (2) a , ...,m (Ma) a ) , (12)
where faggregate denotes the aggregation function, which we specify as the max-pooling pooling operation.",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Notably, other commutative operators, such as summation or average pooling, can be otherwise employed.",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Although these aggregation functions are simple and invariant to the order of words in input sentences, they have been demonstrated to be highly effective in relational reasoning (Parikh et al., 2016; Santoro et al., 2017).",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"To further explore this, in Section 5.3, we conduct an ablation study comparing different choices of alignment and aggregation functions.
",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"The representation hb can be obtained in a similar manner through (9), (10), (11) and (12), but replacing (9) with A = XTaXb (its transpose).",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"Note that this word-by-word alignment is more computationally involved than word-by-context; however, the former has substantially fewer parameters to learn, provided we no longer have to estimate the parameters in (7).",2.4 Fine-Grained Word-by-Word Alignment,[0],[0]
"For large-scale networks, computing and optimizing the conditional probabilities in (1) using (6) is computationally prohibitive, since it requires the summation over all vertices V in G. To address this limitation, we leverage the negative sampling strategy introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013), i.e., we perform computations by sampling a subset of negative edges.",2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
"As a result, the conditional in (6) can be rewritten as:
p(hi|hj) = log σ",2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
"( hj T hi )
+ K∑ i=1",2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
Ehi∼P,2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
"(v) [ log σ ( −hjThi )] ,
where σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)) is the sigmoid function.",2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
"Following Mikolov et al. (2013), we set the noise distribution P (v) ∝",2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
"d3/4v , where dv is the out-degree of vertex v ∈ V .",2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
The number of negative samples K is treated as a hyperparameter.,2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
"We
use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) to update the model parameters while minimizing the objective in (1).",2.5 Training and Inference,[0],[0]
"Network embedding methods can be divided into two categories: (i) methods that solely rely on the structure, e.g., vertex information; and (ii) methods that leverage both the structure the network and the information associated with its vertices.
",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For the first type of models, DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) has been proposed to learn node representations by generating node contexts via truncated random walks; it is similar to the concept of Skip-Gram (Mikolov et al., 2013), originally introduced for learning word embeddings.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"LINE (Tang et al., 2015) proposed a principled objective to explicitly capture first-order and second-order proximity information from the vertices of a network.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Further, Grover and Leskovec (2016) introduced a biased random walk procedure to generate the neighborhood for a vertex, which infers the node representations by maximizing the likelihood of preserving the local context information of vertices.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, these algorithms generally ignore rich heterogeneous information associated with vertices.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Here, we focus on incorporating textual information into network embeddings.
",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To learn semantic-aware network embeddings, Text-Associated DeepWalk (TADW) (Yang et al., 2015) proposed to integrate textual features into network representations with matrix factorization, by leveraging the equivalence between DeepWalk and matrix factorization.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"CENE (ContentEnhanced Network Embedding) (Sun et al., 2016) used bidirectional recurrent neural networks to abstract the semantic information associated with vertices, which further demonstrated the advantages of employing textual information.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To capture the interaction between sentences of vertex pairs, Tu et al. (2017) further proposed ContextAware Network Embedding (CANE), that employs a mutual attention mechanism to adaptively account for the textual information from neighboring vertices.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Despite showing improvement over structure-only models, these semantic-aware methods cannot capture word-level alignment information, which is important for inferring the relationship between node pairs, as previously discussed.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this work, we introduce a WordAlignment-based Network Embedding (WANE)
framework, which aligns and aggregates word-byword matching features in an explicit manner, to obtain more informative network representations.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Datasets We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed WANE model on two standard networkembedding-based tasks, i.e., link prediction and multi-label vertex classification.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The following three real-world datasets are employed for quantitative evaluation: (i) Cora, a standard paper citation network that contains 2,277 machine learning papers (vertices) grouped into 7 categories and connected by 5,214 citations (edges) (ii) HepTh, another citation network of 1,038 papers with abstract information and 1,990 citations; (iii) Zhihu, a network of 10,000 active users from Zhihu, the largest Q&A website in China, where 43,894 vertices and descriptions of the Q&A topics are available.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The average lengths of the text in the three datasets are 90, 54, and 190, respectively.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"To make direct comparison with existing work, we employed the same preprocessing procedure1 of Tu et al. (2017).
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Training Details For fair comparison with CANE (Tu et al., 2017), we set the dimension of network embedding for our model to 200.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The number of negative samples K is selected from {1, 3, 5} according to performance on the validation set.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We set the batch size as 128, and the model is trained using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with a learning rate of 1× 10−3 for all parameters.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Dropout regularization is employed on the word embedding layer, with rate selected from {0.5, 0.7, 0.9}, also on the validation set.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Our code will be released to encourage future research.
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Baselines To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we consider several strong baseline methods for comparisons, which can be categorized into two types: (i) models that only exploit structural information: MMB (Airoldi et al., 2008), DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), LINE (Tang et al., 2015), and node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016).",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"(ii) Models that take both structural and textual information into account: Naive combination (which simply concatenates the structure-based embedding with CNN-based text embeddings, as explored in (Tu et al., 2017), TADW (Yang et al., 2015), CENE (Sun et al.,
1https://github.com/thunlp/CANE
2016), and CANE (Tu et al., 2017).",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"It is worth noting that unlike all these baselines, WANE explicitly captures word-by-word interactions between text sequence pairs.
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Evaluation Metrics,4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We employ AUC (Hanley and McNeil, 1982) as the evaluation metric for link prediction, which measures the probability that vertices within an existing edge, randomly sampled from the test set, are more similar than those from a random pair of non-existing vertices, in terms of the inner product between their corresponding embeddings.
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"For multi-label vertex classification and to ensure fair comparison, we follow Yang et al. (2015) and employ a linear SVM on top of the learned network representations, and evaluate classification accuracy with different training ratios (varying from 10% to 50%).",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The experiments for each setting are repeated 10 times and the average test accuracy is reported.,4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We experiment with three variants for our WANE model: (i) WANE: where the word embeddings of each text sequence are simply average to obtain the sentence representations, similar to (Joulin et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2018c).",5 Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"(ii) WANE-
wc: where the textual embeddings are inferred with word-by-context alignment.",5 Experimental Results,[0],[0]
(iii) WANE-ww: where the word-by-word alignment mechanism is leveraged to capture word-by-word matching features between available sequence pairs.,5 Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"Table 1 presents link prediction results for all models on Cora dataset, where different ratios of edges are used for training.",5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
"It can be observed that when only a small number of edges are available, e.g., 15%, the performances of structure-only methods is much worse than semantic-aware models that have taken textual information into consideration The perfromance gap tends to be smaller when a larger proportion of edges are employed for training.",5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
"This highlights the importance of incorporating associated text sequences into network embeddings, especially in the case of representing a relatively sparse network.",5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
"More importantly, the proposed WANE-ww model consistently outperforms other semantic-aware NE models by a substantial margin, indicating that our model better abstracts word-by-word alignment features from the text sequences available, thus yields more informative network representations.
",5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
"Further, WANE-ww also outperforms WANE or WANE-wc on a wide range of edge training pro-
portions.",5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
This suggests that: (i) adaptively assigning different weights to each word within a text sequence (according to its paired sequence) tends to be a better strategy than treating each word equally (as in WANE).,5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
(ii) Solely considering the context-by-word alignment features (as in WANE-wc) is not as efficient as abstracting word-by-word matching information from text sequences.,5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
"We observe the same trend and the superiority of our WANE-ww models on the other two datasets, HepTh and Zhihu datasets, as shown in Table 2 and 3, respectively.",5.1 Link Prediction,[0],[0]
We further evaluate the effectiveness of proposed framework on vertex classification tasks with the Cora dataset.,5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"Similar to Tu et al. (2017), we generate the global embedding for each vertex by taking the average over its context-aware embeddings with all other connected vertices.",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 3(c), semantic-aware NE methods (including naive combination, TADW, CENE, CANE) exhibit higher test accuracies than semantic-agnostic models, demonstrating the advantages of incorporating textual information.",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"Moreover, WANEww consistently outperforms other competitive semantic-aware models on a wide range of labeled proportions, suggesting that explicitly capturing word-by-word alignment features is not only use-
ful for vertex-pair-based tasks, such as link prediction, but also results in better global embeddings which are required for vertex classification tasks.",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"These observations further demonstrate that WANE-ww is an effective and robust framework to extract informative network representations.
",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"Semi-supervised classification We further consider the case where the training ratio is less than 10%, and evaluate the learned network embedding with a semi-supervised classifier.",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"Following Yang et al. (2015), we employ a Transductive SVM (TSVM) classifier with a linear kernel (Joachims, 1998) for fairness.",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"As illustrated in Table 4, the proposed WANE-ww model exhibits superior performances in most cases.",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"This may be due to the fact that WANE-ww extracts information from the vertices and text sequences jointly, thus the obtained vertex embeddings are less noisy and perform more consistently with relatively small training ratios (Yang et al., 2015).",5.2 Multi-label Vertex Classification,[0],[0]
"Motivated by the observation in Wang and Jiang (2017) that the advantages of different functions to match two vectors vary from task to task, we further explore the choice of alignment and aggregation functions in our WANE-ww model.",5.3 Ablation Study,[0],[0]
"To match the word pairs between two sequences, we experimented with three types of operations: sub-
traction, multiplication, and Sub & Multi (the concatenation of both approaches).",5.3 Ablation Study,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 3(a) and 3(b), element-wise subtraction tends to be the most effective operation performancewise on both Cora and Zhihu datasets, and performs comparably to Sub & Multi on the HepTh dataset.",5.3 Ablation Study,[0],[0]
"This finding is consistent with the results in Wang and Jiang (2017), where they found that simple comparison functions based on elementwise operations work very well on matching text sequences.
",5.3 Ablation Study,[0],[0]
"In terms of the aggregation functions, we compare (one-layer) CNN, mean-pooling, and maxpooling operations to accumulate the matching vectors.",5.3 Ablation Study,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 3(b), max-pooling has the best empirical results on all three datasets.",5.3 Ablation Study,[0],[0]
"This may be attributed to the fact that the maxpooling operation is better at selecting important word-by-word alignment features, among all matching vectors available, to infer the relationship between vertices.",5.3 Ablation Study,[0],[0]
"Embedding visualization To visualize the learned network representations, we further employ t-SNE to map the low-dimensional vectors of the vertices to a 2-D embedding space.",5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"We use the Cora dataset because there are labels associated with each vertex and WANE-ww to obtain the network embeddings.
",5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 4 where each point indicates one paper (vertex), and the color of each point indicates the category it belongs to, the embeddings of the same label are indeed very close in the 2-D plot, while those with different labels are relatively farther from each other.",5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Note that the model is not trained with any label information, indicating that WANE-ww has extracted meaningful patterns from the text and vertex information available.
",5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Case study The proposed word-by-word alignment mechanism can be used to highlight the most informative words (and the corresponding matching features) wrt the relationship between vertices.,5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
We visualize the norm of matching vector obtained in (11) in Figure 5 for the Cora dataset.,5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"It can be observed that matched key words, e.g., ‘MCMC’, ‘convergence’, between the text sequences are indeed assigned higher values in the matching vectors.",5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
These words would be selected preferentially by the final max-pooling aggregation operation.,5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
This indicates that WANEww is able to abstract important word-by-word alignment features from paired text sequences.,5.4 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
We have presented a novel framework to incorporate the semantic information from vertexassociated text sequences into network embeddings.,6 Conclusions,[0],[0]

Improved Semantic-Aware Network Embedding with Fine-Grained Word Alignment,title,[0],[0]
At the heart of natural language parsing is the challenge of representing the “state” of an algorithm— what parts of a parse have been built and what parts of the input string are not yet accounted for— as it incrementally constructs a parse.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Traditional approaches rely on independence assumptions, decomposition of scoring functions, and/or greedy approximations to keep this space manageable.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Continuous-state parsers have been proposed, in which the state is embedded as a vector (Titov and Henderson, 2007; Stenetorp, 2013; Chen and Manning, 2014; Dyer et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Dyer et al. reported state-of-the-art performance on English and Chinese benchmarks using a transition-based parser whose continuous-state embeddings were constructed using LSTM recurrent neural networks (RNNs) whose parameters were estimated to maximize the probability of a gold-standard sequence of parse actions.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The primary contribution made in this work is to take the idea of continuous-state parsing a step further by making the word embeddings that are used to construct the parse state sensitive to the morphology of the words.1 Since it it is well known that a word’s form often provides strong evidence regarding its grammatical role in morphologically rich languages (Ballesteros, 2013, inter alia), this has promise to improve accuracy and statistical efficiency relative to traditional approaches that treat each word type as opaque and independently modeled.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the traditional parameterization, words with similar grammatical roles will only be embedded near each other if they are observed in similar contexts with sufficient frequency.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our approach reparameterizes word embeddings using the same RNN machinery used in the parser: a word’s vector is calculated based on the sequence of orthographic symbols representing it (§3).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although our model is provided no supervision in the form of explicit morphological annotation, we find that it gives a large performance increase when parsing morphologically rich languages in the SPMRL datasets (Seddah et al., 2013; Seddah and Tsarfaty, 2014), especially in agglutinative languages and the ones that present extensive case systems (§4).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In languages that show little morphology, performance remains good, showing that the RNN composition strategy is capable of capturing both morphological regularities and arbitrariness in the sense of Saussure (1916).",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['In languages that show little morphology, performance remains good, showing that the RNN composition strategy is capable of capturing both morphological regularities and arbitrariness in the sense of Saussure (1916).']"
"Finally, a particularly noteworthy result is that we find that character-based word embeddings in some cases obviate explicit POS information, which is usually found to be indispensable for accurate parsing.

A secondary contribution of this work is to show that the continuous-state parser of Dyer et al. (2015) can learn to generate nonprojective trees.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

Table 3 shows a comparison with state-of-theart parsers.,4.4.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art,[0],[0]
"We include greedy transition-based parsers that, like ours, do not apply a beam search (Zhang and Clark, 2008b) or a dynamic oracle (Goldberg and Nivre, 2013).",4.4.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art,[0],[0]
"For all the SPMRL languages we show the results of Ballesteros (2013), who reported results after carrying out a careful automatic morphological feature selection experiment.",4.4.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art,[0],[0]
"For Turkish, we show the results of Nivre et al. (2006a) which also carried out a careful manual morphological feature selection.",4.4.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art,[0],[0]
Our parser outperforms these in most cases.,4.4.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art,[0],[0]
"Since those systems rely on morphological features, we believe that this comparison shows even more that the character-based representations are capturing morphological information, though without explicit morphological features.",4.4.4 Comparison with State-of-the-Art,[0],[0]
"For English and Chinese, we report (Dyer et al., 2015) which is Words + POS but with pretrained word embeddings.

"Botha and Blunsom (2014) show that stems, prefixes and suffixes can be used to learn useful word representations but relying on an external morphological analyzer.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"That is, they learn the morpheme-meaning relationship with an additive model, whereas we do not need a morphological analyzer.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Chen et al. (2015) proposed joint learning of character and word embeddings for Chinese, claiming that characters contain rich information.

We have presented several interesting findings.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"First, we add new evidence that character-based representations are useful for NLP tasks.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we demonstrate that they are useful for transition-based dependency parsing, since they are capable of capturing morphological information crucial for analyzing syntax.
",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The improvements provided by the characterbased representations using bidirectional LSTMs are strong for agglutinative languages, such as
Basque, Hungarian, Korean, and Turkish, comparing favorably to POS tags as encoded in those languages’ currently available treebanks.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This outcome is important, since annotating morphological information for a treebank is expensive.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Our finding suggests that the best investment of annotation effort may be in dependencies, leaving morphological features to be learned implicitly from strings.
",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The character-based representations are also a way of overcoming the out-of-vocabulary problem; without any additional resources, they enable the parser to substantially improve the performance when OOV rates are high.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We expect that, in conjunction with a pretraing regime, or in conjunction with distributional word embeddings, further improvements could be realized.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
