"Authorship Attribution (AA) tackles the problem of determining who, among a set of authors, wrote the document at hand.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"AA has relevant applications ranging from plagiarism detection (Stamatatos, 2011) to Forensic Linguistics, such as identifying authorship of threatening emails or malicious code.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Applied areas such as law and journalism can also benefit from authorship attribution, where identifying the true author of a piece of text (such as a ransom note) may help save lives or catch the offenders.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We know from state of the art research in AA that the length of the documents and the number of po-
tential candidate authors have an important effect on the accuracy of AA approaches (Moore, 2001; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We can also point out the most common features that have been used successfully in AA work, including: bag-of-words (Madigan et al., 2005; Stamatatos, 2006), stylistic features (Zheng et al., 2006; Stamatatos et al., 2000), and word and character level n-grams (Kjell et al., 1994; Keselj et al., 2003; Peng et al., 2003; Juola, 2006).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The utility of bag-of-words features is well understood: they effectively capture correlations between authors and topics (Madigan et al., 2005; Kaster et al., 2005).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The discriminative value of these features is thus directly related to the level of content divergence among authors and among train and test sets.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The utility of stylistic features is also well understood: they model author preferences for the use of punctuation marks, emoticons, white spaces, and other traces of writing style.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such preferences are less influenced by topic, and directly reflect some of the unique writing patterns of an author.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Character n,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"-grams are the single most successful feature in authorship attribution (Koppel et al., 2009; Frantzeskou et al., 2007; Koppel et al., 2011), but the reason for their success is not well understood.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One hypothesis is that character n-grams carry a little bit of everything: lexical content, syntactic content, and even style by means of punctuation and white spaces (Koppel et al., 2011).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While this argument seems plausible, it falls short of a rigorous explanation.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we investigate what in the make-up
93
of these small units of text makes them so powerful.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our goal is two-fold: on the one hand we want to have a principled understanding of character ngrams that will inform their use as features for AA and other tasks; on the other hand we want to make AA approaches more accessible to non-experts so that, for example, they could be acceptable pieces of evidence in criminal cases.
",1 Introduction,[0.9583568405724622],"['In comparison to all the above methods, our importance sampling scheme based on an upper bound to the gradient norm has a solid theoretical basis with clear objectives, very easy to choose hyperparameters, theoretically guaranteed speedup and can be applied to any type of network and loss function.']"
"The research questions we aim to answer are:
• Are all character n-grams equally important?",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, are the prefix of ‘there’, the suffix of ‘breathe’ and the whole word ‘the’ all equivalent?",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More generally, are character n-grams that capture morpho-syntactic information, thematic information and style information equally important?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
• Are the character n-grams that are most important for single-domain settings also the most important for cross-domain settings?,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Which character n-grams are more like bag-of-words features (which tend to track topics), and which are more like stylistic features (which tend to track authors)?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
• Do different classifiers agree on the importance of the different types of character n-grams?,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Are some character n-grams consistently the best regardless of the learning algorithm?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
• Are some types of character n-grams irrelevant in AA tasks?,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Are there categories of character n-grams that we can exclude and get similar (or better) performance than using all n-grams?,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"If there are, are they the same for both singledomain and cross-domain AA settings?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our study shows that using the default bag-ofwords representation of char n-grams results in collapsing sequences of characters that correspond to different linguistic aspects, and that this yields suboptimal prediction performance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We further show that we can boost accuracy by loosing some categories of n-grams.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Char n-grams closely related to thematic content can be completely removed without loss of accuracy, even in cases where the train and test sets have the same topics represented, a counter-intuitive argument.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given the wide spread use of char n-grams
in text classification tasks, our findings have significant implications for future work in related areas.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To answer our research questions and explore the value of character n-grams in authorship attribution, we propose to separate character n-grams into ten distinct categories.",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"Unlike previous AA work where all character n-grams were combined into a single bagof-n-grams, we evaluate each category separately to understand its behavior and effectiveness in AA tasks.",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"These categories are related to the three linguistic aspects hypothesized to be represented by character n-grams: morpho-syntax (as represented by affix-like n-grams), thematic content (as represented by word-like n-grams) and style (as represented by punctuation-based n-grams).",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"We refer to these three aspects as super categories (SC).
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
The following sections describe the different types of n-grams.,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
We use the sentence in Table 1 as a running example for the classes and in Table 2 we show the resulting n-grams in that sentence.,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"For ease of understanding, we replace spaces in n-grams with underscores ( ).
2.1 Affix n-grams Character n-grams are generally too short to represent any deep syntax, but some of them can reflect morphology to some degree.",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"In particular, we consider the following affix-like features by looking at n-grams that begin or end a word:
prefix A character n-gram that covers the first n characters of a word that is at least n+ 1 characters long.
suffix A character n-gram that covers the last n characters of a word that is at least n + 1 characters long.
space-prefix A character n-gram that begins with a space.
space-suffix A character n-gram that ends with a space.
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"2.2 Word n-grams While character n-grams are often too short to capture entire words, some types can capture partial words and other word-relevant tokens.",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"We consider the following such features:
whole-word A character n-gram that covers all characters of a word that is exactly n characters long.
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
mid-word,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"A character n-gram that covers n characters of a word that is at least n + 2 characters long, and that covers neither the first nor the last character of the word.
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"multi-word N -grams that span multiple words, identified by the presence of a space in the middle of the n-gram.
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
2.3 Punctuation n-grams,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
The main stylistic choices that character n-grams can capture are the author’s preferences for particular patterns of punctuation.,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"The following features characterize punctuation by its location in the n-gram.
beg-punct A character n-gram",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"whose first character is punctuation, but middle characters are not.
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"mid-punct A character n-gram with at least one punctuation character that is neither the first nor the last character.
end-punct A character n-gram whose last character is punctuation, but middle characters are not.
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"The above ten categories are intended to be disjoint, so that a character n-gram belongs to exactly one of the categories.",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"For n-grams that contain both spaces and punctuation, we first categorize by punctuation and then by spaces.",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"For example, ‘e, ’ is assigned to the mid-punct category, not the spacesuffix category.
",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
We have observed that in our data almost 80% of the n-grams in the punct-beg and punct-mid categories contain a space.,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
This tight coupling of punctuation and spaces is due to the rules of English orthography: most punctuation marks require a space following them.,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"The 20% of n-grams that have punctuation but no spaces correspond mostly to the exceptions to this rule: quotation marks, mid-word hyphens, etc.",2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
An interesting experiment for future work would be to split out these two types of punctuation into separate feature categories.,2 Categories of Character N -grams,[0],[0]
"We consider two corpora, a single-domain corpus, where there is only one topic that all authors are writing about, and a multi-domain corpus, where there are multiple different topics.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The latter allows us to test the generalization of AA models, by testing them on a different topic from that used for training.
",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The first collection is the CCAT topic class, a subset of the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (Lewis et al., 2004).",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Although this collection was not gathered for the goal of doing authorship attribution studies, previous work has reported results for AA with 10 and 50 authors (Stamatatos, 2008; Plakias and Stamatatos, 2008; Escalante et al., 2011).",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"We refer to these as CCAT 10 and CCAT 50, respectively.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Both CCAT 10 and CCAT 50 belong to CCAT category (about corporate/industrial news) and are balanced across authors, with 100 documents sampled for each author.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
Manual inspection of the dataset revealed that some of the authors in this collection consistently used signatures at the end of documents.,3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Also, we noticed some writers use quotations a lot.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Con-
sidering these parts of text for measuring the frequencies of character n-grams is not a good idea because signatures provide direct clues about the authorship of document and quotations do not reflect the author’s writing style.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Therefore, to clean up the CCAT collection, we preprocessed it to remove signatures and quotations from each document.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Since the CCAT collection contains documents belonging to only corporate/industrial topic category, this will be our single-domain collection.
",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The other collection consists of texts published in The Guardian daily newspaper written by 13 authors in four different topics (Stamatatos, 2013).",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"This dataset contains opinion articles on the topics: World, U.K., Society, and Politics.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Following prior work, to make the collection balanced across authors, we choose at most ten documents per author for each of the four topics.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
We refer to this corpus as Guardian1.,3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"We also consider a variation of this corpus that makes it more challenging but that more closely matches realistic scenarios of forensic investigation that deal with short texts such as tweets, SMS, and emails.",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
We chunk each of the documents by sentence boundaries into five new short documents.,3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"We refer to this corpus as Guardian2.
",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Table 3 shows some of the statistics of the CCAT and Guardian corpora and Table 4 presents some of the top character n-grams for each category (taken from an author in the Guardian data, but the top ngrams look qualitatively similar for other authors).",3 Datasets,[0],[0]
We performed various experiments using different categories of character n-grams.,4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
We chose n=3 since our preliminary experiments found character 3-grams to be more effective than other higher level character n-grams.,4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"For each category, we considered only those 3-grams that occur at least five times in the training documents.
",4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"The performance of different authorship attribu-
tion models was measured in terms of accuracy.",4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"In the single-domain CCAT experiments, accuracy was measured using the train/test partition of prior work.",4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"In the cross-domain Guardian experiments, accuracy was measured by considering all 12 possible pairings of the 4 topics, treating one topic as training data and the other as testing data, and averaging accuracy over these 12 scenarios.",4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"This ensured that in the crossdomain experiments, the topics of the training data were always different from that of the test data.
",4 Experimental Settings,[0.9528229103018041],"['For completeness, in the supplementary material we include a theoretical analysis that explains why sampling based on the loss also achieves variance reduction during the late stages of training.']"
"We trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using the Weka implementation (Witten and Frank, 2005) with default parameters.",4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
We also ran some comparative experiments with the Weka implementation of naive Bayes classifiers and the LibSVM implementation of SVMs.,4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"In the results below, when performance of a single classifier is presented, it is the result of Weka’s SVM, which generally gave the best performance.",4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"When performance of other classifiers are presented, the classifiers are explicitly indicated.",4 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"In this section, we present various results on authorship attribution tasks using both single as well as cross-domain datasets.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We will explore character ngrams in depth and try to understand why they are so effective in discriminating authors.
5.1 Which n-gram Categories are Most Author-Discriminative?
After breaking character n-grams into ten disjoint categories, we empirically illustrate what categories are
Single Domain (CCAT)
most discriminative.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Table 5 shows the accuracy of each type of n-gram for each of the different corpora.
",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Table 5(a) shows that the top four categories for single-domain AA are: prefix, suffix, space-prefix, and mid-word.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
These four categories have the best performance on both CCAT 10 and CCAT 50.,5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In contrast, Table 5(b) shows that the top four categories for cross-domain AA are: prefix, space-prefix, beg-
punct, and mid-punct.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For both single-domain and cross-domain AA, prefix and space-prefix are strong features, and are generally better than the suffix features, perhaps because authors have more control over prefixes in English, while suffixes are often obligatory for grammatical reasons.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For cross-domain AA, beg-punct and midpunct are the top features, likely because an author’s
use of punctuation is consistent even when the topic changes.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For single-domain AA, mid-word was also a good feature, probably because it captured lexical information that correlates with authors’ preferences towards writing about specific topics.
",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Figure 1 shows an alternate view of these results, graphing the rank of each n-gram type.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For computing the rank, the accuracies of the ten different n-gram type classifiers are sorted in decreasing order and ranked from 1 to 10 respectively with ties getting the same rank.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For the Guardian corpora, the average rank of each n-gram category was computed by averaging its rank across the 12 possible test/train cross-domain combinations.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In both of the single-domain CCAT corpora, the classifier based on prefix n-grams had the top accuracy (rank 1), and the classifier based on mid-punct had the worst accuracy (rank 10).",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In both of the cross-domain Guardian corpora, on the other hand, mid-punct was among the top-ranked n-gram categories.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This suggests that punctuation features generalize the best across topic, but if AA is more of a topic classification task (as in the single-domain CCAT corpora), then punctuation adds little over other features that more directly capture the topic.
",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Since our cross-domain datasets are small, we performed a small number of planned comparisons using a two-tailed t-test over the accuracies on the Guardian1 and Guardian2 corpora.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We found that in both corpora, the best punctuation category (punctmid) is better than the best word category (wholeword) with p < 0.001.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In the Guardian2 corpus, the best affix category (space-prefix) is also better than the best word category (whole-word) with p < 0.05, but this does not hold in the Guardian1 corpus (p = 0.14).",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Also, we observed that in both Guardian1 and Guardian2 datasets, both punct-mid and spaceprefix are better than multi-word (p < 0.01).
",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Overall, we see that affix n-grams are generally effective in both single-domain and cross-domain settings, punctuation n-grams are effective in crossdomain settings, and mid-word is the only effective word n-gram, and only in the single-domain setting.",5 Experimental Results and Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Importance of Different n-gram Types?
",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"The previous experiments have shown, for example, that prefix n-grams are universally predictive in AA
tasks, that mid-word n-grams are good predictors in single-domain settings, and that beg-punct n-grams are good predictors in cross-domain settings.",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"But are these facts about the n-gram types themselves, or are these results only true for the specific SVM classifiers we trained?
",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"To see whether certain types of n-grams are fundamentally good or bad, regardless of the classifier, we compare performance of the different n-gram types for three classifiers: Weka SVM classifiers (as used in our other experiments), LibSVM classifiers and Weka’s naive Bayes classifiers1.",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows the n-gram category rankings for all these classifiers2 for both the single-domain CCAT and the cross-domain Guardian settings.
",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"Across the different classifiers, the pattern of feature rankings are similar.",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
Table 6 shows the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) for the per-ngram-type accuracies of each pair of classifiers.,5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"We observe fairly high correlations, with ρ above 0.70 for all single-domain pairings, and between 0.44 and 0.81 for cross-domain pairings.
",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"As in Section 5.1, prefix and space-prefix are among the most predictive n-gram types.",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"In the single-domain settings, we again see that suffix and mid-word are also highly predictive, while in the cross-domain settings, we again see that beg-punct and mid-punct are highly predictive.",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"These results all confirm that some types of n-grams are fundamentally more predictive than others, and our results are not specific to the particular type of classifier used.
",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"1Weka SVM and LibSVM are both support vector machine classifiers, but Weka uses Platt’s sequential minimal optimization algorithm while LibSVM uses working set selection with second order information.",5.2 Do Different Classifiers Agree on the,[0],[0]
"The result is that they achieve different performance on our AA tasks.

"In the previous sections, we have seen that some types of character n-grams are more predictive than others - affix n-grams performed well in both single domain and cross-domain settings and punctuation n-grams performed well in cross-domain settings.",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"In general, word n-grams were not as predictive as other types of n-grams (with the one exception being mid-word n-grams in the single domain setting).",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"Given this poor performance of word n-grams, a natural question is: could we exclude these features entirely and achieve similar performance?
",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
Our goal then is to compare a model trained on affix n-grams and punct n-grams against a model trained on “all” n-grams.,5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"We consider two definitions of “all”:
all-untyped The traditional approach to extracting n-grams where n-gram types are ignored (e.g., ‘the’ as a whole word is no different from ‘the’ in the middle of a word)
all-typed The approach discussed in this paper, where n-grams of different types are distinguished (equivalent to the set of all affix+punct+word n-grams).
",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"We compare these models trained on all the n-grams to our affix+punct model.
",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
Table 7 shows this analysis.,5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"For either definition of “all”, the model that discards all word features achieves performance as high or higher than the model with all of the features, and does so with only about two thirds of the features.",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"This is not too surprising in the cross-domain Guardian tasks, where the word n-grams were among the worst features.",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"On the single-domain CCAT tasks this result is more surprising, since we have discarded the mid-word n-grams, which was one of the best single-domain n-gram types.",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
This indicates that whatever information mid-word is capturing it is also being captured in other ways via affix and punct n-grams.,5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"Of all 1024 possible combinations of features, we tried a
number of different combinations and were unable to identify one that outperformed affix+punct.",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
"Overall, this experiment gives compelling evidence that affix and punct n-grams are more important than word n-grams.",5.3 Are Some Character N -grams Irrelevant?,[0],[0]
We did a manual exploration of our datasets.,6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"In our cross-domain dataset, the character 3-gram ‘sti’ shows up as both prefix and mid-word.",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"All 13 authors use ‘sti’ frequently as a mid-word n-gram in words such as institution, existing, justice, and distinction.",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"For example:
• The government’s story is that the existing warheads might be deteriorating.
",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"• For all the justice of many of his accusations, the result is occasionally as dreadful as his title suggests.
",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"But only six authors use ‘sti’ as a prefix, in examples like:
• Their mission was to convince tourists that Britain was still open for business.
",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"• There aren’t even any dead people on it, since by the very act of being dead and still famous, they assert their long-term impact.
",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
Thus ‘sti’ as a prefix is predictive of authorship even though ‘sti’ as a mid-word n-gram is not.,6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Notably, under the traditional untyped bag-of-n-grams approach, both versions of ‘sti’ would have been treated the same, and this discriminative power would have been lost.
",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"As already demonstrated in Section 5 that affix+punct features perform better than using all the features, we would like to use an example from our dataset to visualize the text when features in SC word are discarded.",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
Out of seven categories in affix and punct,6 Analysis,[0],[0]
", we computed in how many of them each character belongs to, three being the maximum possible value.",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we show each character with different opacity level depending on number of categories it belongs to: zero will get white color (word related n-grams), one will get 33% black, two will get 67% black, and three will get 100% black.",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"In Table 8, we show an example sentence before (first row of Table 8) and after (second row of Table 8) showing the opacity level of each character.",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"It is clear that the darkest characters are those around the punctuation characters and those around spaces are second darkest, while the lightest (with 0% darkness) are the ones in the middle of long words.",6 Analysis,[0],[0]
This gives us an idea about the characters in a text that are important for AA tasks.,6 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Various hypotheses have been put forth to explain the “black magic” (Kestemont, 2014) behind the success of character n-gram features in authorship attribution.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
Kestemont (2014) conjectured that their utility was in capturing function words and morphology.,7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Koppel et al. (2009) suggested that they were capturing topic information in single domain settings, and style and syntactic information in cross-domain settings.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
Our study provides empirical evidence for testing these claims.,7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"We did indeed find that the ability of character n-grams to capture morphology is useful, as reflected in the high prediction performance of af-
fix n-grams in both single-domain and cross-domain settings.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"And we found that word n-grams (capturing topic information) were useful in single domain settings, while puct n-grams (capturing style information) were useful in cross-domain settings.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"We further found that word n-grams are unnecessary, even in single-domain settings.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Models based only on affix and punct n-grams performed as well as models with all n-grams regardless of whether it was a single-domain or cross-domain authorship attribution task.
",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
Our findings on the value of selecting n-grams according to the linguistic aspect they represent may also be beneficial in other classification tasks where character n-grams are commonly used.,7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Promising tasks are those related to the stylistic analysis of texts, such as native language identification, document similarity and plagiarism detection.
",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Morphologically speaking, English is a poor language.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
The fact that we identified significant differences in performance by selecting n-gram categories that are related to affixation in this poorly inflected language suggests that we may find even larger differences in performance in morphologically richer languages.,7 Discussion,[0],[0]
We leave this research question for future work.,7 Discussion,[0],[0]

Neural conversational models require substantial amounts of dialogue data to estimate their parameters and are therefore usually learned on large corpora such as chat forums, Twitter discussions or movie subtitles. These corpora are, however, often challenging to work with, notably due to their frequent lack of turn segmentation and the presence of multiple references external to the dialogue itself. This paper shows that these challenges can be mitigated by adding a weighting model into the neural architecture. The weighting model, which is itself estimated from dialogue data, associates each training example to a numerical weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling. At training time, these sample weights are included into the empirical loss to be minimised. Evaluation results on retrieval-based models trained on movie and TV subtitles demonstrate that the inclusion of such a weighting model improves the model performance on unsupervised metrics.",text,[0.9603342578920524],"['However, for the more complicated CIFAR100, only sampling with our proposed upper-bound to the gradient norm reduces the variance of the gradients and provides faster convergence.']"

"estimated from raw (non-annotated) dialogue corpora, allowing them to be deployed with a limited amount of domain-specific knowledge and feature engineering.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Due to their large parameter space, the estimation of neural conversation models requires considerable amounts of dialogue data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"They are therefore often trained on conversations collected from various online resources, such as Twitter discussions (Ritter et al., 2010) online chat logs (Lowe et al., 2017), movie scripts (DanescuNiculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011) and movie and TV subtitles (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although these corpora are undeniably useful, they also face some limitations from a dialogue modelling perspective.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"First of all, several dialogue corpora, most notably those extracted from subtitles, do not include any explicit turn segmentation or speaker identification (Serban and Pineau, 2015; Lison and Meena, 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In other words, we do not know whether two consecutive sentences are part of the same dialogue turn or were uttered by different speakers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The neural conversation model may therefore inadvertently learn responses that remain within the same dialogue turn instead of starting a new turn.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, these dialogues contain multiple references to named entities (in particular, person names such as fictional characters) that are specific to the dialogue in question.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These named entities should ideally not be part of the conversation model, since they often draw on an external context that is absent from the inputs provided to the conversation model.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, the mention of character names in a movie is associated with a visual context (for instance, the characters appearing in a given scene) that is not captured in the training data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, a substantial portion of the utterances observed in these corpora is made of neutral, commonplace responses (“Perhaps”, “I
384
don’t know”, “Err”, ...) that can be used in most conversational situations but fall short of creating meaningful and engaging conversations with human users (Li et al., 2016a).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The present paper addresses these limitations by adding a weighting model to the neural architecture.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The purpose of this model is to associate each 〈context, response〉 example pair to a numerical weight that reflects the intrinsic “quality” of each example.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The instance weights are then included in the empirical loss to minimise when learning the parameters of the neural conversation model.,1 Introduction,[0.9559976100546487],"['Contrary to the aforementioned algorithms, our proposed importance sampling does not improve the asymptotic convergence of SGD but results in pragmatic improvements in all the metrics given a fixed time budget.']"
The weights are themselves computed via a neural model learned from dialogue data.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Experimental results demonstrate that the use of instance weights improves the performance of neural conversation models on unsupervised metrics.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Human evaluation results are, however, inconclusive.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The rest of this paper is as follows.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The next section presents a brief overview of existing work on neural conversation models.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Section 3 provides a description of the instance weighting approach.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Section 4 details the experimental validation of the proposed model, using both unsupervised metrics and a human evaluation of the selected responses.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, Section 5 discusses the advantages and limitations of the approach, and Section 6 concludes this paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Neural conversation models are a family of neural architectures (generally based on deep convolutional or recurrent networks) used to represent mappings between dialogue contexts (or queries) and possible responses.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Compared to previous statistical approaches to dialogue modelling based on Markov processes (Levin et al., 2000; Rieser and Lemon, 2011; Young et al., 2013), one benefit of these neural models is their ability to be estimated from raw dialogue corpora, without having to rely on additional annotation layers for intermediate representations such as state variables or dialogue acts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Rather, neural conversation models automatically derive latent representations of the dialogue state based on the observed utterances.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Neural conversation models can be divided into two main categories, retrieval models and generative models.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Retrieval models are used to select the most relevant response for a given context amongst a (possibly large) set of predefined responses, such as the set of utterances extracted
from a corpus (Lowe et al., 2015; Prakash et al., 2016).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Generative models, on the other hand, rely on sequence-to-sequence models (Sordoni et al., 2015) to generate new, possibly unseen responses given the provided context.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These models are built by linking together two recurrent architectures: one encoder which maps the sequence of input tokens in the context utterance(s) to a fixedsized vector, and one decoder that generates the response token by token given the context vector (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recent papers have shown that the performance of these generative models can be improved by incorporating attentional mechanisms (Yao et al., 2016) and accounting for the structure of conversations through hierarchical networks (Serban et al., 2016).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Neural conversation models can also be learned using adversarial learning (Li et al., 2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this setting, two neural models are jointly learned: a generative model producing the response, and a discriminator optimised to distinguish between human-generated responses and machine-generated ones.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The discriminator outputs are then used to bias the generative model towards producing more human-like responses.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The linguistic coherence and diversity of the models can be enhanced by including speakeraddressee information (Li et al., 2016b) and by expressing the objective function in terms of Maximum Mutual Information to enhance the diversity of the generated responses (Li et al., 2016a).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As demonstrated by (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017), neural conversation models can also be combined with external knowledge sources in the form of factual information or entity-grounded opinions, which is an important requirement for developing task-oriented dialogue systems that must ground their action in an external context.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Dialogue is a sequential decision-making process where the conversational actions of each participant influence not only the current turn but the long-term evolution of the dialogue (Levin et al., 2000).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To incorporate the prediction of future outcomes in the generation process, several papers have explored the use of reinforcement learning techniques, using deep neural networks to model the expected future reward (Li et al., 2016c; Cuayáhuitl, 2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In particular, the Hybrid Code Networks model of (Williams et al., 2017) demonstrate how a mixture of supervised learning, reinforcement learning and domain-specific knowl-
edge can be used to optimise dialogue strategies from limited amount of training data.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast with the approaches outlined above, this paper does not present a new neural architecture for conversational models.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Rather, it investigates how the performance of existing models can be improved “upstream”, by adapting how these models can be trained on large, noisy corpora with varying levels of quality.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"It should be noted that, although the experiments presented in Section 4 focus on a limited range of neural models, the approach presented in this paper is designed to be model-independent and can be applied as a preprocessing step to any data-driven model of dialogue.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As mentioned in the introduction, the interactions extracted from large dialogue corpora do not all have the same intrinsic quality, due for instance to the frequent lack of turn segmentation or the presence of external, unresolvable references to person names.",3 Approach,[0],[0]
"In other words, there is a discrepancy between the actual 〈context, response〉 pairs found in these corpora and the conversational patterns that should be accounted for in the neural model.
",3 Approach,[0],[0]
"One way to address this discrepancy is by framing the problem as one of domain adaptation, the source domain being the original dialogue corpus and the target domain representing the dialogues we want our model to produce.",3 Approach,[0],[0]
"The target domain is in this case not necessarily another dialogue domain, but simply reflects the fact that the distribution of responses in the raw corpus does not necessarily reflect the distribution of responses we ultimately wish to encode in the conversational model.
",3 Approach,[0],[0]
"A popular strategy for domain adaptation in natural language processing, which has notably been used in POS-tagging, sentiment analysis, spam filtering and machine translation (Bickel et al., 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Foster et al., 2010; Xia et al., 2013), is to assign a higher weight to training instances whose properties are similar to the target domain.",3 Approach,[0],[0]
We present below such an instance weighting approach tailored for neural conversational models.,3 Approach,[0],[0]
"The quality of a particular 〈context, response〉 pair is difficult to determine using handcrafted rules – for instance, the probability of a turn bound-
ary may depend on multiple factors such as the presence of turn-yielding cues or the time gap between the utterances (Lison and Meena, 2016).",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"To overcome these limitations, we adopt a datadriven approach and automatically learn a weighting model from examples of “high-quality” responses.",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"What constitutes a high-quality response depends in practice on the specific criteria we wish to uphold in the conversation model – for instance, favouring responses that are likely to form a new dialogue turn (rather than a continuation of the current turn), avoiding the use of dull, commonplace responses, or disfavouring the selection of responses that contain unresolved references to person names.
",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"The weighting model can be expressed as a neural model which associates each 〈context, response〉 example pair to a numerical weight.",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
The architecture of this neural network is depicted in Figure 1.,3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"It is composed of two recurrent sub-networks with shared weights, one for the context and one for the response.",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
Each sub-network takes a sequence of tokens as input and pass them through an embedding layer and a recurrent layer with LSTM or GRU cells.,3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"The fixed-size vectors for the context and response are then fed to a regular densely-connected layer, and finally to the final weight value through a sigmoid activation function.",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"Additional features can also be included whenever available – for instance, timing information for movie and TV subtitles (such as the duration gap between the context and its response, in milliseconds), or document-level features such as the dialogue genre or the total duration of the dialogue.
",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"To estimate its parameters, the neural model is provided with positive examples of “high-quality” responses along with negative examples sampled at random from the corpus.",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"Based on this training data, the network learns to assign higher weights to the 〈context, response〉 pairs whose output vectors (combined with the additional inputs) are close from the high-quality examples, and a lower weight for those further away.",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"In practice, the selection of high-quality example pairs from a given corpus can be performed through a combination of simple heuristics, as detailed in Section 4.1.",3.1 Weighting model,[0],[0]
"Once the weighting model is estimated, the next step is to run it on the entire dia-
logue corpus to compute the expected weight of each 〈context, response〉 pair.",3.2 Instance weighting,[0.9522791124427241],['This means that adding a single line of code to call this wrapper before actually fitting the model is sufficient to switch from the standard uniform sampling to our importance-sampling scheme.']
These sample weights are then included in the empirical loss that is being minimised during training.,3.2 Instance weighting,[0],[0]
"Formally, assuming a set of context-response pairs {(c1, r1), (c2, r2), ...(cn, rn)} with associated weights {w1, ...wn}, the estimation of the model parameters θ is expressed as a minimisation problem.",3.2 Instance weighting,[0],[0]
"For retrieval models, this minimisation is expressed as:
θ∗ = minθ n∑ 1 wi L(yi, f(ci, ri; θ)) (1)
where L is a loss function (for instance, the cross-entropy loss), and yi is set to either 1 if ri is the response to ci, and 0 otherwise (when ri is a negative example).",3.2 Instance weighting,[0],[0]
"For generative models, the minimisation is similarly expressed as:
θ∗ = minθ n∑ 1 wi L(ri, f(ci; θ)) (2)
",3.2 Instance weighting,[0],[0]
"In both cases, the loss computed from each example pair is multiplied by the weight value determined by the weight model.",3.2 Instance weighting,[0],[0]
Examples associated with a larger weight wi will therefore have a larger influence on the gradient update steps.,3.2 Instance weighting,[0],[0]
"The approach is evaluated on the basis of retrievalbased neural models trained on English-language subtitles from (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016).",4 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Three alternative models are evaluated:
1.",4 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"A traditional TF-IDF model,
2.",4 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"A Dual Encoder model trained directly on the corpus examples,
3.",4 Evaluation,[0],[0]
A Dual Encoder model combined with the weighting model from Section 3.1.,4 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"TF-IDF model The TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) model computes the similarity between the context and its response using methods from information retrieval (Ramos, 2003).",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
TFIDF measures the importance of a word in a “document” (in this case the context or response) relative to the whole corpus.,4.1 Models,[0],[0]
The model transforms the context and response (represented as bag-ofwords) into TF-IDF-weighted vectors.,4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"These vectors are sparse vectors of a size equivalent to the vocabulary size, where each row corresponds, if the given word is present in the context or response, to its TF-IDF weight, and is 0 otherwise.",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"The matching score between the context and its response is then determined as the cosine similarity between the two vectors:
similarity = vc · vr
‖vc‖2 ‖vr‖2 (3)
where vc and vr respectively denote the TF-IDFweighted vectors for the context and response.
",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"Dual Encoder The Dual Encoder model (Lowe et al., 2017) consists of two recurrent networks, one for the context and one for the response.",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"The tokens are first
passed through an embedding layer and then to a recurrent layer with LSTM or GRU cells.",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"In the original formalisation of this model (Lowe et al., 2015), the context vector is transformed through a dense layer of same dimension, representing the “predicted” response.",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"The inner product of the predicted and actual responses is then calculated and normalised, yielding a similarity score.",4.1 Models,[0.950015549210905],"['As a result, the variation of the gradient norm is mostly captured by the gradient of the loss function with respect to the pre-activation outputs of the last layer of our neural network.']"
"This model, however, only seeks to capture the semantic similarity between the two sequences, while the selection of the most adequate response in a given context may also need to account for other factors such as the grammaticality and coherence of the response.",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
We therefore extend the Dual Encoder model in two ways.,4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"First, both the context and response vectors are transformed through a dense layer at the end of the recurrent layer (instead of just the context vector).",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"Second, the final prediction is connected to both the inner product of the two vectors and to the response vector itself, as depicted in Figure 2.
",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"Dual Encoder with instance weighting
Finally, the third model relies on the exact same Dual Encoder model as above, but applies the weighting model described in Section 3.1 prior to learning in order to assign weights to each training example.",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
The weighting model is estimated on a subset of the movie and TV subtitles augmented with speaker information and filtered through heuristics to ensure a good cohesion between the context and its response.,4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"These heuristics are detailed in the next section.
",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"Although the architecture of the Dual Encoder
is superficially similar to the weighting model of Figure 1, the two models serve a different purpose: the weighting model returns the expected quality of a training example, while the Dual Encoder returns a score expressing the adequacy between the context and the response.",4.1 Models,[0],[0]
"Training data for the conversation models The dataset used for training the three retrieval models is the English-language portion of the OpenSubtitles corpus of movie and TV subtitles (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016).",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The full dataset is composed of 105 445 subtitles and 95.5 million utterances, each utterance being associated with a start and end time (in milliseconds).
",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Training data for the weighting model For training the weighting model, we extracted a small subset of the full corpus of subtitles corresponding to 〈context, response〉 pairs satisfying specific quality criteria.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The first step was to align at the sentence level the subtitles with an online collection of movie and TV scripts (1 069 movies and 6 398 TV episodes), following the approach described in (Lison and Meena, 2016).
",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
This alignment enabled us to annotate the subtitles with speaker names and turn boundaries.,4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Based on these subtitles, we then selected example pairs with two heuristics:
1.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"To ensure the response constitutes an actual reply from another speaker and not simply a continuation of the current turn, the
subtitles were segmented into sub-dialogues.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"〈context, response〉 pairs including a change of speaker from the context to the response were then extracted from these subdialogues.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Since multi-party dialogues make it harder to determine who replies to whom, only sub-dialogues with two participants were considered in the subset.
",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
2.,4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"To ensure the response is intelligible given the context (without drawing on unresolved references to e.g. fictional person names), we also filtered out from the subset the dialogue turns including mentions of fictional character names and out-of-vocabulary words.
",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"A total of 95 624 〈context, response〉 pairs can be extracted using these two heuristics.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
This corresponds to about 0.1 % of the total number of examples for the OpenSubtitles corpus.,4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"These pairs are used as positive examples for the weighting model, along with negative pairs sampled at random from the corpus.
Test data Two distinct corpora are used as test sets for the evaluation.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The first corpus, whose genre is relatively close to the training set, is the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee, 2011), which is a collection of fictional conversations extracted from movie scripts (unrelated to the ones used for training the weighting model).",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
The transcripts from this corpus are segmented into conversations.,4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
Each conversation is represented as a sequence of dialogue turns.,4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"As this paper concentrates on the selection of relevant responses in a given context, we limited the test pairs to the ones where the context ends with a question, which yields a total of 67 305 〈context, response〉 pairs.
",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The second test set comes from a slightly different conversational genre, namely theatre plays.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
The scripts of 62 English-language theatre plays were downloaded from public websites.,4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"We also limited the test pairs to the pairs where the context ends with a question, for a total of 3 427 pairs.",4.2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The utterances from all datasets were tokenised, lemmatised and POS-tagged using the spaCy NLP library1.",4.2.1 Experimental design Preprocessing,[0],[0]
"We also ran the named entity recogniser

"We can observe that the Dual Encoder with instance weights outperforms the baseline model on this validation set – which is not per se a surprising result, since the purpose

of the weighting model is precisely to bias the conversation model to give more importance to these types of example pairs.",4.3 Results,[0],[0]
"To further investigate the potential of this weighting strategy for neural conversational models, we conducted a human evaluation of the responses generated by the two neural models included in the evaluation.",4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
"We collected human judgements on 〈context, response〉 pairs using a crowdsourcing platform.",4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
"We extracted 115 random contexts from the Cornell Movie Dialogs corpus and used four distinct strategies to generate dialogue responses: a random predictor (used to identify the lower bound), the two Dual Encoder models (both without and with instance weights), and expert responses (used to identify the upper bound).",4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
The expert responses were manually authored by two human annotators.,4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
"The resulting 460 〈context, response〉 pairs were evaluated by 8 distinct human judges each (920 ratings per model).",4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
"The human judges were asked to rate the consistency between context and response on a 5-points scale, from Inconsistent to Consistent.",4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
"In total,
118 individuals participated in the crowdsourced evaluation.
",4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
The results of this human evaluation are presented in Figure 4.,4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
"There is unfortunately no statistically significant difference between the baseline Dual Encoder (M = 2.97, SD = 1.27) and the one combined with the weighting model (M = 3.04, SD = 1.27), as established by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, W (1838) = 410360, p = 0.23.",4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
These inconclusive results are probably due to the very low agreement between the evaluation participants (Krippendorff’s α for continuous variable = 0.36).,4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]
The fact that the lower and upper bounds are only separated by 2 standard deviations confirms the difficulty for the raters to discriminate between responses.,4.4 Human evaluation,[0.9530882935397155],"['This can also be deduced by observing figure 2, where the probabilities proportional to the loss and the upper-bound are plotted against the optimal ones (proportional to the gradient-norm).']"
"We hypothesise that the nature of the corpus, which is heavily dependent on an external context (the movie scenes), makes it particularly difficult to assess the consistency of the responses.

Some examples of responses produced by the two Dual Encoder models illustrate the improvements brought by the weighting model.,4.4 Human evaluation,[0],[0]

"The limitations of neural conversational models trained on large, noisy dialogue corpora such as movie and TV subtitles have been discussed in several papers.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Some of the issues raised in previous papers are the absence of turn segmentation in subtitling corpus (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban and Pineau, 2015; Lison and Meena, 2016), the lack of long-term consistency and “personality” in the generated responses (Li et al., 2016b), and the ubiquity of dull, commonplace responses when training generative models (Li et al., 2016a).",5 Discussion,[0],[0]

"In essence, the proposed approach replaces a one-pass training regime with a two-pass procedure: the first pass to determine the quality of each example pair, and a second pass to update the model based on the observed pair and its associated weight.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"We also showed that these weights can be determined in a data-driven manner with a neural model trained on example pairs selected for their adherence to specific quality criteria.
",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Instead of this two-pass procedure, an alternative approach is to directly learn a conversation model on the subset of example pairs that are known to be of high-quality.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, one major shortcoming of this approach is that it consider-
ably limits the size of the training set that can be exploited.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"For instance, the data used to estimate the weighting model in Section 4.2 corresponds to a mere 0.1 % of the total English-language part of the OpenSubtitles corpus (since the utterances had to be associated with speaker names derived from aligned scripts in order to apply the heuristics).",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"In contract, the proposed two-pass procedure can scale to datasets of any size.
",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
The results from Section 4 are limited to retrieval-based models.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"One important question for future work is to investigate whether the results carry over to generative, sequence-to-sequence models.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"As generative models are more computationally intensive to train than retrieval models, the presented approach may bring another important benefit, namely the ability to filter out part of the training data to concentrate the training time on “interesting” examples with a high cohesion between the context and its response.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
Dialogue corpora such as chat logs or movie subtitles are very useful resources for developing opendomain conversation models.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"They do, however, also raise a number of challenges for conversation modelling.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Two notable challenges are the lack of segmentation in dialogue turns (at least for the movie subtitles) and the presence of external context that is not captured in the dialogue transcripts themselves (leading to mentions of person names and unresolvable named entities).
",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
This paper showed how to mitigate these challenges through the use of a weighting model applied on the training examples.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This weighting model can be estimated in a data-driven manner, by providing example of “high-quality” training pairs along with random pairs extracted from the same corpus.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
The criteria that determine how these training pairs should be selected depend in practice on the type of conversational model one wishes to learn.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This instance weighting approach can be viewed as a form of domain adaptation, where the data points from the source domain (in this case, the original corpus) are re-weighted to improve the model performance in a target domain (in this case, the interactions in which the conversation model will be deployed).
",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Evaluation results on retrieval-based neural models demonstrate the potential of this approach.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The weighting model is essentially a preprocess-
ing step and can therefore be combined with any type of conversational model.
",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Future work will focus on two directions.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The first is to extend the weighting model to account for other criteria, such as ensuring diversity of responses and coherence across turns.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The second is to evaluate the approach on other types of neural conversational models, and more particularly on generative models.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Neural conversational models require substantial amounts of dialogue data to estimate their parameters and are therefore usually learned on large corpora such as chat forums, Twitter discussions or movie subtitles.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"These corpora are, however, often challenging to work with, notably due to their frequent lack of turn segmentation and the presence of multiple references external to the dialogue itself.",abstractText,[0],[0]
This paper shows that these challenges can be mitigated by adding a weighting model into the neural architecture.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"The weighting model, which is itself estimated from dialogue data, associates each training example to a numerical weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"At training time, these sample weights are included into the empirical loss to be minimised.",abstractText,[0],[0]
Evaluation results on retrieval-based models trained on movie and TV subtitles demonstrate that the inclusion of such a weighting model improves the model performance on unsupervised metrics.,abstractText,[0],[0]

"We propose to mitigate this phenomenon with a principled importance sampling scheme that focuses computation on “informative” examples, and reduces the variance of the stochastic gradients during training. Our contribution is twofold: first, we derive a tractable upper bound to the persample gradient norm, and second we derive an estimator of the variance reduction achieved with importance sampling, which enables us to switch it on when it will result in an actual speedup.
The resulting scheme can be used by changing a few lines of code in a standard SGD procedure, and we demonstrate experimentally, on image classification, CNN fine-tuning, and RNN training, that for a fixed wall-clock time budget, it provides a reduction of the train losses of up to an order of magnitude and a relative improvement of test errors between 5% and 17%.",text,[0],[0]

Existing importance sampling methods can be roughly categorized in methods applied to convex problems and methods designed for deep neural networks.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
Importance sampling for convex optimization problems has been extensively studied over the last years.,2.1. Importance Sampling for Convex Problems,[0],[0]

"Such simple importance measures do not exist for Deep Learning and the direct application of the aforementioned theory (Alain et al., 2015), requires clusters of GPU workers just to compute the sampling distribution.",2.1. Importance Sampling for Convex Problems,[0],[0]

"Using this fact in combination to equation 53, we claim that so does the per sample gradient norm thus small loss values imply small gradients.",D. Ablation study on B,[0],[0]
"However, large loss values are not well correlated with the gradient norm which can also be observed in § 4.1 in the paper.

"To summarize, we conjecture that due to the above facts, sampling proportionally to the loss reduces the variance only when the majority of the samples have losses close to 0.",D. Ablation study on B,[0],[0]
"Our assumption is validated from our experiments, where the loss struggles to achieve a speedup in the early stages of training where most samples still have relatively large loss values.",D. Ablation study on B,[0],[0]
"Deep neural network training spends most of the computation on examples that are properly handled, and could be ignored.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We propose to mitigate this phenomenon with a principled importance sampling scheme that focuses computation on “informative” examples, and reduces the variance of the stochastic gradients during training.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Our contribution is twofold: first, we derive a tractable upper bound to the persample gradient norm, and second we derive an estimator of the variance reduction achieved with importance sampling, which enables us to switch it on when it will result in an actual speedup.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"The resulting scheme can be used by changing a few lines of code in a standard SGD procedure, and we demonstrate experimentally, on image classification, CNN fine-tuning, and RNN training, that for a fixed wall-clock time budget, it provides a reduction of the train losses of up to an order of magnitude and a relative improvement of test errors between 5% and 17%.",abstractText,[0],[0]
