0	32	Much attention has recently been paid to non-task-orienteddialogue systems —orchatoriented dialogue systems— both in research (Higashinaka et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2016) and in industry.
5	37	Therefore, we must consider the case where a user uses terms outside of the system’s vocabulary1, i.e. terms that have ontological categories the system does not know.
6	60	If the system can acquire the term’s category during dialogues, it will be able to interact with users more naturally and the cost of expanding its knowledge base will be reduced.
27	24	(a) explicit, correct U1: Mutton Biryani was good.
28	21	S1: Is Mutton Biryani Italian?
34	47	In this domain, the problem is to acquire the categories of foods that the system does not know.
36	24	Note that in this paper we also assume the category of an unknown term is predicted with an existing method (Otsuka et al., 2013; Ono et al., 2016).
42	51	However, such explicit confirmation requests can degrade the user experience in chat-oriented dialogues, especially when the predicted category is incorrect as in Figure2 (b), or the category of the unknown term is obvious as in Figure2 (c).
43	26	We have proposed using implicit confirmation (Ono et al., 2016).
46	86	Determining if the predicted category is correct or not in implicit confirmation, however, is not always easy.
67	32	This is possible because our system is designed as a server-based dialogue system and can give implicit confirmation requests with the same predicted category to different users.
68	50	The proposed method determines more accurately whether or not the predicted category in the implicit confirmation request is correct by exploiting multiple responses to them.
70	19	The category can be predicted using surface information of the unknown term such as character n-gram and character types in Japanese (Otsuka et al., 2013).
74	44	Figure 5 gives an overview of the proposed method.

118	32	For Feature g2, 17 negative expressions were used such as “is not [category name used inS1]” and “No.” For Feature g3, six expressions such as “It is [category name not used inS1]” that tries to correct the system’s previous confirmation request were used.
133	14	Table 3 shows confusion matrices of the raw outputs for the two feature sets.
138	14	More specifically, we performed the same experiments with all combinations of the 11 features, i.e., 2047(= 211 − 1) feature sets, and calculated their average-F scores.
159	34	The value was set to1, 000 when ( N n ) exceeds1, 000.

196	21	Figure 9 depicts the recall rates when we set very high threshold values forConf (w , c) so that the precision rates become almost one, i.e.,1 − ϵ.
199	43	This recall rate was rather low, but we think high precision rates should be prioritized over recall rates, even if some correct information is discarded at the current.
202	14	We have proposed a method to determine if the ontological category of an unknown term included in an implicit confirmation request is correct or not.
209	38	We are planning to address several issues before deploying this method in a chatbot.
210	196	Although we intuitively think implicit confirmation requests do not degrade users’ impressions compared with repetitive explicit confirmation requests, we need to experimentally verify this by a user study.
211	35	On the basis of its results, we will define a strategy of when to make implicit confirmation requests and when to make explicit confirmation requests.
212	30	Despite these remaining issues, we believe that the experimental results presented in this paper are valuable in that they show the possibility of lexical acquisition through implicit confirmation.
