0	4	The study of relational data arising from various networks including social, biological and physical networks is becoming increasingly important due to the emergence of massive relational data collected from these domains.
1	9	Many efforts have been dedicated to develop statistical models in terms of community detection and missing link prediction for analyzing relational data arising from static networks, where either a single snapshot of the network of interest or an aggregated network over time is presented; see (Goldenberg et al., 2010) for a review of the literature.
2	14	However, network data, such as friendships or interactions in a social network, is often dynamic since the relations among the entities within the network may appear or disappear over time (Mucha et al., 2010).
3	28	Accordingly, the latent groups composed of those temporally connected entities also form and decay over time.
4	64	Hence, appropriate models are needed to enable a better understanding of the formation and evolution of dynamic networks (Phan & Airoldi, 2015).
5	19	A probabilistic framework is proposed to model such dynamic networks by assuming the network of interest is composed of a set of latent groups.
9	60	The ideal number of latent groups can be adaptively learned from data via the shrinkage mechanism of the dRGaP.
10	1	Explicitly modelling group birth/death dynamics can be useful in many applications.
11	48	For instance, latent groups in a network of military disputes between countries could mean alliances such as NATO coordinating collective defence to attacks by external forces (Schein et al., 2016a).
14	4	We demonstrate that our model can discover interpretable latent structure on a real network of military interstate disputes (Ghosn et al., 2004) that agrees with our knowledge of international relations (Section 5).
16	7	Hence, we capture the dynamics of individual node-group memberships evolving over time via gamma Markov processes.
18	23	In addition, the Bernoulli-Poisson link is also a more appropriate model for imbalanced binary data (Zhou, 2017; Hu et al., 2015), which makes the proposed model appealing for analyzing real-world relational data that are usually extremely sparse.
19	33	To perform inference, we present an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm exploiting the Pólya-gamma data augmentation technique (Polson et al., 2013) and the data augmentation and marginalization technique for discrete data (Zhou et al., 2015).
21	33	In Section 2, we shortly review the gamma process and the thinned completely random measure framework.
25	27	The complete Gibbs sampling algorithm and additional experimental results are presented in the supplementary material.
27	3	We generalize this construction for longitudinal network modelling.
31	6	The gamma process (GaP) is a completely random measure (CRM) (Kingman, 1967) defined on the product space Θ × R>0 as G ∼ GaP(G0, c), where c is a scale parameter, and G0 is a finite and continuous base measure over a complete separable metric space Θ, such that G(Sk) ∼ Gamma(G0(Sk), c) are independent gamma random variables for disjoint subsets {Sk}∞k=1 of Θ.
38	87	Let G = ∑∞ k=1 rkδ(xk,θk) be a CRM on X × Θ × R>0, and let T denote the time set as the coveriate.
41	3	The new CRMs are well-defined by the mapping theorem for the Poisson processes (Kingman, 1993), that is proved in (Foti et al., 2013).
43	7	Let ν(dx,dθ,dr) = H(dx)G0(dθ)ν0(dr), where ν0(dr) = cr−1e−crdr is the Lévy measure of the gamma process.
44	21	We transform a Gaussian basis kernel pointwise using a logistic function as the thinning function: Pxk(t) = σ { ω0k + T∑ l=1 ωlk exp[−φk(t− l)2] } , where σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)) denotes the logistic function.
45	14	We fix the centres of these kernels to the T discrete time points in covariate space T .
49	100	The generative procedure can be expressed as G = ∞∑ k=1 rkδ(xk,θk) ∼ CRM(ν(dx, dθ,dr)), (1) ωlk ∼ NIG(0, 1, 1), φk ∼ Cat(φ∗1, .
51	17	For the sake of clarity, we limit our focus to unweighted (binary) undirected (symmetric) dynamic networks without self-links although the proposed model can straightforwardly be generalized to nonnegative real-weighted networks via the Poisson randomized gamma distribution (Zhou et al., 2016).
52	15	We denote each snapshot of a dynamic network by A(t) ∈ {0, 1}N×N with N being the number of nodes.
53	12	The binary symmetric matrix A(t) has entries A(t)ij = 1 if an edge between nodes i and j is present at time t, and A(t)ij = 0 otherwise.
54	94	Let Π (t) ij be the link probability between nodes i and j.
55	29	Our model specifies A (t) ij | Π (t) ij ∼ Bernoulli(Π (t) ij ), t ∈ T independently for each i = 2, .
56	94	, i− 1, with E [ A (t) ij | Π (t) ij ] = 1− exp ( − K∑ k=1 K∑ k′=1 z (t) ik λ (t) kk′z (t) jk′ ) , where z(t)ik ∈ R>0 characterizes the membership of node i to group k at time t ∈ T .
57	2	In contrast to the latent feature relational models (Foulds et al., 2011; Heaukulani et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013) that assume binary node-group relationships, our nonnegative memberships capture how strongly each node associates with multiple groups.
