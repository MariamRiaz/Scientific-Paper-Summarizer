0	78	Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) is a rhythm-based video game with millions of players worldwide (Hoysniemi, 2006).
2	28	A player’s score depends upon both hitting the correct buttons and hitting them at the correct time.
3	36	Step charts vary in difficulty with harder charts containing more steps and more complex sequences.
4	32	The dance pad contains up, down, left, and right arrows, each of which can be in one of four states: on, off, hold, or release.
5	67	Because the four arrows can be activated or released independently, there are 256 possible step combinations at any instant.

8	26	Charts tend to mirror musical structure: particular sequences of steps correspond to different motifs (Figure 2), and entire passages may reappear as sections of the song are repeated.
17	50	We introduce the task of learning to choreograph, in which we learn to generate step charts from raw audio.
21	128	Second, step selection consists of choosing which steps to place at each timestamp.
57	28	Note that while the total number of songs is relatively small, when considering all charts across all songs the datasets contain around 35 hours of annotations and 350,000 steps.
63	21	In addition to encoded audio, packs consist of metadata including a song’s title, artist, a list of time-stamped tempo changes, and a time offset to align the recording to the tempos.
64	27	They also contain information such as the chart difficulties and the name of the choreographer.
133	19	We consider predicted placements to be true positives if they lie within a ±20ms window of a ground truth.
149	25	We apply earlystopping determined by average per-step cross entropy on validation data.
153	22	We evaluate the performance of our step placement methods against baselines via the methodology outlined below.
156	24	Our MLP architecture contains two fully-connected layers of size 256 and 128, with rectifier nonlinearity applied to each layer.
170	24	Baselines For step selection, we compare the performance of the conditional LSTM to an n-gram model.
182	20	We calculate accuracy by comparing the ground-truth step to the argmax over a model’s predictive distribution given the previous sequence of ground-truth tokens.
205	31	We believe this owes to the distinctiveness of author styles.
206	20	Because we have so many step charts for Fraxtil, the network is able to closely mimic his patterns.
207	22	While the ITG dataset contains multiple charts per author, none are so prolific as Fraxtil.
208	21	We released a public demo5 using our most promising models as measured by our quantitative evaluation.
209	39	Players upload an audio file, select a difficulty rating and receive a step chart for use in the StepMania DDR simulator.
210	21	Our demo produces a step chart for a 3 minute song in about 5 seconds using an NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU.
211	43	At time of writing, 220 players have produced 1370 step charts with the demo.
212	60	We also solicited feedback, on a scale of 1-5, for player “satisfaction” with the demo results.
213	20	The 22 respondents reported an average satisfaction of 3.87.
214	46	A promising direction for future work is to make the selection algorithm audio-aware.
215	27	We know qualitatively that elements in the ground truth choreography tend to coincide with specific musical events: jumps are used to emphasize accents in a rhythm; freezes are used to transition from regions of high rhythmic intensity to more ambient sections.
244	26	By combining insights from musical onset detection and statistical language modeling, we have designed and evaluated a number of deep learning methods for learning to choreograph.
