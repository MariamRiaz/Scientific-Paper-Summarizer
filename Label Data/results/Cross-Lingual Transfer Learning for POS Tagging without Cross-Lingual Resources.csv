"Evaluating on POS datasets from 14 different target languages with English as the source language in the Universal Dependencies corpus 1.4 (Nivre et al., 2016), the proposed model showed significantly better performance when the source language and the target language are in the same language family, and competitive performance when the language families are different.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Cross-Lingual Training Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the proposed model.,2 Model,[0],[0]
"The baseline POS tagging model is similar to Plank et al. (2016)’s model, and it corresponds to having only word+char embeddings, common BLSTM, and Softmax Output in Figure 1.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Given an input
word sequence, a BLSTM is used for the character sequence of each word, where the outputs of the ends of the character sequences from the forward LSTM and the backward LSTM are concatenated to the word vector of the current word to supplement the word representation.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"These serve as an input to a BLSTM, and an output layer are used for POS tag prediction.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
"For the cross-lingual transfer learning, the character embedding, the BLSTM with the character embedding (Yang et al., 2017),1 and the common BLSTM are shared for all the given languages while word embeddings and private BLSTMs have different parameters for different languages.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
The outputs of the common BLSTM and the private BLSTM of the current language are summed to be used as the input to the softmax layer to predict the POS tags of given word sequences.,2 Model,[1.0],['The outputs of the common BLSTM and the private BLSTM of the current language are summed to be used as the input to the softmax layer to predict the POS tags of given word sequences.']

"In addition to this main objective, two more objectives for improving the transfer learning are described in the following subsections.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Language-Adversarial Training We encourage the outputs of the common BLSTM to be language-agnostic by using language-adversarial training (Chen et al., 2016) inspired by domainadversarial training (Ganin et al., 2016; Bousmalis et al., 2016).",2 Model,[1.0],"['Language-Adversarial Training We encourage the outputs of the common BLSTM to be language-agnostic by using language-adversarial training (Chen et al., 2016) inspired by domainadversarial training (Ganin et al., 2016; Bousmalis et al., 2016).']"
"First, we encode a BLSTM output sequence as a single vector using a CNN/MaxPool encoder, which is implemented the same as a CNN for text classification (Kim, 2014).",2 Model,[0],[0]
"The encoder is with three convolution filters whose sizes are 3, 4, and 5.",2 Model,[1.0],"['The encoder is with three convolution filters whose sizes are 3, 4, and 5.']"
"For each filter, we pass the BLSTM output sequence as the input sequence and obtain a single vector from the filter output by using max pooling, and then tanh activation function is used for transforming the vector.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Then, the vector outputs of the three filters are concatenated and forwarded to the language discriminator through the gradient reversal layer.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"The discriminator is implemented

",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Since the gradient reversal layer is below the language classifier, the gradients minimizing language classification errors are passed back with opposed sign to the sentence encoder, which adversarially encourages the sentence encoder to be language-agnostic.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"The loss function of the language classifier is formulated as:
La = − S∑
i=1
li log l̂i, (2)
where S is the number of sentences, li is the language of the i-th sentence, and l̂i is the softmax output of the tagging.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Note that though the language classifier is optimized to minimize the language classification error, the gradient from the language classifier is negated so that the bottom layers are trained to be language-agnostic.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Bidirectional Language Modeling Rei (2017) showed the effectiveness of the bidirectional language modeling objective, where each time step of the forward LSTM outputs predicts the word of the next time step, and each of the backward LSTM outputs predicts the previous word.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"For example, if the current sentence is “I am happy”, the forward LSTM predicts “am happy <eos>” and the backward LSTM predicts “<bos> I am”.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"This objective encourages the BLSTM layers and the embedding layers to learn linguistically general-purpose representations, which are also useful for specific downstream tasks (Rei, 2017).",2 Model,[0],[0]
"We adopted the bidirectional language modeling objective, where the sum of the common BLSTM and the private BLSTM is used as the input to the language modeling module.",2 Model,[1.0],"['We adopted the bidirectional language modeling objective, where the sum of the common BLSTM and the private BLSTM is used as the input to the language modeling module.']"
"It can be formulated as:

i=1",2 Model,[0],[0]
N∑ j=1 log (P (wj+1|fj)),2 Model,[0],[0]

log (P (wj−1|bj)) , (3)
where fj and bj represent the j-th outputs of the forward direction and the backward direction, respectively, given the output sum of the common BLSTM and the private BLSTM.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
"All the three loss functions are added to be optimized altogether as:
L = ws",2 Model,[0],[0]
"(Lp + λLa + λLl) , (4)
where λ is gradually increased from 0 to 1 as epoch increases so that the model is stably trained with auxiliary objectives (Ganin et al., 2016).",2 Model,[0],[0]
ws is used to give different weights to the source language and the target language.,2 Model,[1.0],['ws is used to give different weights to the source language and the target language.']
"Since the source language has a larger train set and we are focusing on improving the performance of the target language, ws is set to 1 when training the target language.",2 Model,[1.0],"['Since the source language has a larger train set and we are focusing on improving the performance of the target language, ws is set to 1 when training the target language.']"
"For the source language, instead, it is set as the size of the target train set divided by the size of the source train set.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"For the evaluation, we used the POS datasets from 14 different languages in Universal Dependencies corpus 1.4 (Nivre et al., 2016).",3 Experiments,[1.0],"['For the evaluation, we used the POS datasets from 14 different languages in Universal Dependencies corpus 1.4 (Nivre et al., 2016).']"
"We used English as the source language, which is with 12,543 training sentences.2",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
We chose datasets with 1k to 14k training sentences.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The number of tag labels differs for each language from 15 to 18 though most of them are overlapped within the languages.

"Table 1 shows the POS tagging accuracies of different transfer learning models when we limited the number of training sentences of the target languages to be the same as 1,280 for fair comparison among different languages.",3 Experiments,[1.0],"['Table 1 shows the POS tagging accuracies of different transfer learning models when we limited the number of training sentences of the target languages to be the same as 1,280 for fair comparison among different languages.']"
The remainder training examples of the target languages are still used for both language-adversarial training and bidirectional language modeling since the objectives do not require tag labels.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
Training with only the train sets in the target languages (c) showed 91.61% on average.,3 Experiments,[1.0],['Training with only the train sets in the target languages (c) showed 91.61% on average.']
"When bidirectional language modeling objective is used (c, l), the accuracies were significantly increased to 92.82% on average.",3 Experiments,[1.0],"['When bidirectional language modeling objective is used (c, l), the accuracies were significantly increased to 92.82% on average.']"
"Therefore, we used the bidirectional language modeling for all the transfer learning evaluations.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"With transfer learning, the three cases of using only the common BLSTM (c), using only the private BLSTMs (p), and using both (c, p) were evaluated.",3 Experiments,[1.0],"['With transfer learning, the three cases of using only the common BLSTM (c), using only the private BLSTMs (p), and using both (c, p) were evaluated.']"
"They showed better average accuracies than target only cases, but they showed mixed results.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]

"For the languages belonging to Slavic, Romance, or Indo-Iranian, our model shows competitive performance with the highest average accuracies among the compared models.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Since languages in the same family are more likely to be similar and compatible, it is expected that the gain from the knowledge transfer to the languages in the same family to be higher than transferring to the languages in different families, which was shown in the results.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This shows that utilizing both language-general representations that are encouraged to be more language-agnostic and language-specific representations effectively helps improve the POS tagging performance with transfer learning.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows the results when using 320 taglabeled training sentences.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In this case, transfer learning methods still show better accuracies than target-only approaches on average.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, the performance gain is weakened compared to using 1,280 labeled training sentences and there are some mixed results.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In several cases, just utilizing private BLSTMs without the common BLSTM showed better accuracies than utilizing the common BLSTM.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"When training with only 32 tag-labeled sentences, which is an extremely low-resourced setting, transfer learning methods still showed better accuracies than target-only methods on average.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, not using the common BLSTM
in transfer learning models showed better performance than using it on average.3",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
The main reason would be that we are not given a sufficient number of labeled training sentences to train both the common BLSTM and the private BLSTMs.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In this case, just having private BLSTMs without the common BLSTM can show better performance.",3 Experiments,[1.0],"['In this case, just having private BLSTMs without the common BLSTM can show better performance.']"
"We also evaluated the opposite cases, which use all the tag-labeled training sentences in the target languages, and they showed mixed results.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For example, the accuracy of German with the target only model is 93.31% while that of the proposed model is 93.04%.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is expected since transfer learning is effective when the target train set is small.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
An extension of this work is utilizing multiple languages as the source languages.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Since we have four languages for each of Germanic, Slavic, and Romance language families, we evaluated the performance of those languages using the other languages in the same families as the source languages expecting that languages in the same language family are more likely to be helpful each other.",3 Experiments,[1.0],"['Since we have four languages for each of Germanic, Slavic, and Romance language families, we evaluated the performance of those languages using the other languages in the same families as the source languages expecting that languages in the same language family are more likely to be helpful each other.']"
"For the efficiency, we performed multi-task learning for multiple languages rather than differentiating the targets from sources.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"When we tried to use 1,280, 320, and 32 tag-labeled training sentences for each language in the multi-source settings, the results showed noticeably better per-

"Considering that utilizing 1,280*3=3,840, 320*3=960, or 32*3=96 tag labels from three other languages showed better results than using 12,543 English tag labels as the source, we can see that the knowledge transfer from multiple languages can be more helpful than that from single resource-rich source language.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We also tried to use Wasserstein distance (Arjovsky et al., 2017) for the adversarial training in the multi-source settings, but there were no significant differences on average.4
