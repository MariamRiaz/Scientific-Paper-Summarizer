Entering a new group is rarely easy.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Adjusting to unfamiliar behavioral norms and donning a new identity can be cognitively and emotionally taxing, and failure to do so can lead to exclusion.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But successful enculturation to the group often yields significant rewards, especially in organizational contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Fitting in has been tied to positive career outcomes such as faster time-to-promotion, higher performance ratings, and reduced risk of being fired (O’Reilly et al., 1991; Goldberg et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A major challenge for enculturation research is distinguishing between internalization and self-
regulation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Internalization, a more inwardly focused process, involves identifying as a group member and accepting group norms, while selfregulation, a more outwardly oriented process, entails deciphering the group’s normative code and adjusting one’s behavior to comply with it.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing approaches, which generally rely on selfreports, are subject to various forms of reporting bias and typically yield only static snapshots of this process.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent computational approaches that use language as a behavioral signature of group integration uncover dynamic traces of enculturation but cannot distinguish between internalization and self-regulation.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To overcome these limitations, we introduce a dynamic measure of directed linguistic accommodation between a newcomer and existing group members.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our approach differentiates between an individual’s (1) base rate of word use and (2) linguistic alignment to interlocutors.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The former corresponds to internalization of the group’s linguistic norms, whereas the latter reflects the capacity to regulate one’s language in response to peers’ language use.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We apply this language model to a corpus of internal email communications and personnel records, spanning a seven-year period, from a mid-sized technology firm.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that changes in base rates and alignment, especially with respect to pronoun use, are consistent with successful assimilation into a group and can predict eventual employment outcomes— continued employment, involuntary exit, or voluntary exit—at levels above chance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We use this predictive problem to investigate the nature of linguistic alignment.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our results suggest that the common formulation of alignment as a lexical-level phenomenon is incomplete.

Linguistic alignment Linguistic alignment is the tendency to use the same or similar words as one’s conversational partner.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Alignment is an instance of a widespread and socially important human behavior: communication accommodation, the tendency of two interacting people to nonconsciously adopt similar behaviors.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Evidence of accommodation appears in many behavioral dimensions, including gestures, postures, speech rate, self-disclosure, and language or dialect choice (see Giles et al. (1991) for a review).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"More accommodating people are rated by their interlocutors as more intelligible, attractive, and cooperative (Feldman, 1968; Ireland et al., 2011; Triandis, 1960).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"These perceptions have material consequences—for example, high accommodation requests are more likely to be fulfilled, and pairs who accommodate more in how they express uncertainty perform better in lab-based tasks (Buller and Aune, 1988; Fusaroli et al., 2012).
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Although accommodation is ubiquitous, individuals vary in their levels of accommodation in ways that are socially informative.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Notably, more powerful people are accommodated more strongly in many settings, including trials (Gnisci, 2005), online forums (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012), and Twitter (Doyle et al., 2016).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Most relevant for this work, speakers may increase their accommodation to signal camaraderie or decrease it to differentiate from the group.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For example, Bourhis and Giles (1977) found that Welsh English speakers increased their use of the Welsh accent and language in response to an English speaker who dismissed it.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
Person-group fit and linguistic alignment These findings suggest that linguistic alignment is a useful avenue for studying how people assimilate into a group.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Whereas traditional approaches to studying person-group fit rely on self-reports that are subject to various forms of reporting bias and cannot feasibly be collected with high granularity across many points in time, recent studies have proposed language-based measures as a means to tracing the dynamics of person-group fit without having to rely on self-reports.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Building on Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013)’s research into language use similarities as a proxy for social distance between individuals, Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) and Goldberg et al. (2016) devel-
oped a measure of cultural fit based on the similarity in linguistic style between individuals and their colleagues in an organization.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Their timevarying measure highlights linguistic compatibility as an important facet of cultural fit and reveals distinct trajectories of enculturation for employees with different career outcomes.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While this approach can help uncover the dynamics and consequences of an individual’s fit with her colleagues in an organization, it cannot disentangle the underlying reasons for this alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For two primary reasons, it cannot distinguish between fit that arises from internalization and fit produced by self-regulation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"First, Goldberg et al. (2016) and Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) define fit using a symmetric measure, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which does not take into account the direction of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
Yet the distinction between an individual adapting to peers versus peers adapting to the individual would appear to be consequential.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Second, this prior work considers fit across a wide range of linguistic categories but does not interrogate the role of particular categories, such as pronouns, that can be especially informative about enculturation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For example, a person’s base rate use of the first-person singular (I) or plural (we) might indicate the degree of group identity internalization, whereas adjustment to we usage in response to others’ use of the pronoun might reveal the degree of self-regulation to the group’s normative expectations.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Modeling fit with WHAM To address these limitations, we build upon and extend the WHAM alignment framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016) to analyze the dynamics of internalization and selfregulation using the complete corpus of email communications and personnel records from a mid-sized technology company over a seven-year period.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM uses a conditional measure of alignment, separating overall homophily (unconditional similarity in people’s language use, driven by internalized similarity) from in-the-moment adaptation (adjusting to another’s usage, corresponding to self-regulation).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM also provides a directed measure of alignment, in that it estimates a replier’s adaptation to the other conversational participant separately from the participant’s adaptation to the replier.
Level(s) of alignment The convention within linguistic alignment research, dating back to early
work on Linguistic Style Matching (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002), is to look at lexical alignment: the repetition of the same or similar words across conversation participants.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"From a communication accommodation standpoint, this is justified by assuming that one’s choice of words represents a stylistic signal that is partially independent of the meaning one intends to express—similar to the accommodation on paralinguistic signals discussed above.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"The success of previous linguistic alignment research shows that this is valid.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"However, words are difficult to divorce from their meanings, and sometimes repeating a word conflicts with repeating its referent.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"In particular, pronouns often refer to different people depending on who uses the pronoun.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While there is evidence that one person using a first-person singular pronoun increases the likelihood that her conversation partner will as well (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007), we may also expect that one person using first-person singular pronouns may cause the other to use more second-person pronouns, so that both people are referring to the same person.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"This is especially important under the Interactive Alignment Model view (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), where conversants align their entire mental representations, which predicts both lexical and referential alignment behaviors will be observed.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Discourse-strategic explanations for alignment also predict alignment at multiple levels (Doyle and Frank, 2016).
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Since we have access to a high-quality corpus with meaningful outcome measures, we can investigate the relative importance of these two types of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We will show that referential alignment is more predictive of employment outcomes than is lexical alignment, suggesting a need for alignment research to consider both levels rather than just the latter.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We use the complete corpus of internal emails exchanged among full-time employees at a midsized US-based technology company between 2009 to 2014 (Srivastava et al., forthcoming).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
Each email was summarized as a count of word categories in its text.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"These categories are a subset of the Linguistic Information and Word Count system (Pennebaker et al., 2007).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"The categories were chosen because they are likely to be indica-
tive of one’s standing/role within a group.1
We divided email chains into message-reply pairs to investigate conditional alignment between a message and its reply.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To limit these pairs to cases where the reply was likely related to the preceding message, we removed all emails with more than one sender or recipient (including CC/BCC), identical sender and recipient, or where the sender or recipient was an automatic notification system or any other mailbox that was not specific to a single employee.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"We also excluded emails with no body text or more than 500 words in the body text, and pairs with more than a week’s latency between message and reply.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Finally, because our analyses involve enculturation dynamics over the first six months of employment, we excluded replies sent by an employee whose overall tenure was less than six months.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"This resulted in a collection of 407,779 messagereply pairs, with 485 distinct replying employees.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
We combined this with monthly updates of employees joining and leaving the company and whether they left voluntarily or involuntarily.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Of the 485, 66 left voluntarily, 90 left involuntarily, and 329 remained employed at the end of the observation period.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
Privacy protections and ethical considerations Research based on employees’ archived electronic communications in organizational settings poses potential threats to employee privacy and company confidentiality.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To address these concerns, and following established ethical guidelines for the conduct of such research (Borgatti and Molina, 2003), we implemented the following procedures: (a) raw data were stored on secure research servers behind the company’s firewall; (b) messages exchanged with individuals outside the firm were eliminated; (c) all identifying information such as email addresses was transformed into hashed identifiers, with the company retaining access to the key code linking identifying information to hashed identifiers; and (d) raw message content was transformed into linguistic categories so that identities could not be inferred from message content.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Per terms of the non-disclosure agreement we signed with the firm, we are not able to share the data underlying the analyses reported below.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"1Six pronoun categories (first singular (I), first plural (we), second (you), third singular personal (he, she), third singular impersonal (it, this), and third plural (they)) and five time/certainty categories (past tense, present tense, future tense, certainty, and tentativity).
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"We can, however, share the code and dummy test data, both of which can be accessed at http: //github.com/gabedoyle/acl2017.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To assess alignment, we use the Word-Based Hierarchical Alignment Model (WHAM) framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The core principle of WHAM is that alignment is a change, usually an increase, in the frequency of using a word category in a reply when the word category was used in the preceding message.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For instance, a reply to the message What will we discuss at the meeting?, is likely to have more instances of future tense than a reply to the message What did we discuss at the meeting?",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Under this definition, alignment is the log-odds shift from the baseline reply frequency, the frequency of the word in a reply when the preceding message did not contain the word.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"WHAM is a hierarchical generative modeling framework, so it uses information from related observations (e.g., multiple repliers with similar demographics) to improve its robustness on sparse data (Doyle et al., 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"There are two key parameters, shown in Figure 2: ηbase, the log-odds of a given word category c when the preceding message did not contain c, and ηalign, the increase in the log-odds of c when the preceding message did contain c.
A dynamic extension To understand enculturation, we need to track changes in both the alignment and baseline over time.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"We add a month-bymonth change term to WHAM, yielding a piecewise linear model of these factors over the course of an employee’s tenure.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Each employee’s tenure is broken into two or three segments: their first six months after being hired, their last six months before leaving (if they leave), and the rest of their tenure.2 The linear segments for their alignment are fit as an intercept term ηalign, based at their first month (for the initial period) or their last month (for the final period), and per-month slopes α.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Baseline segments are fit similarly, with parameters ηbase and β.3",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To visualize the align-
2Within each segment, the employee’s alignment model is similar to that of Yurovsky et al. (2016), who introduced a constant by-month slope parameter to model changes in parent-child alignment during early linguistic development.
3The six month timeframe was chosen as previous research has found it to be a critical period for early enculturation (Bauer et al., 1998).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Pilot investigations into the change
ment behaviors and the parameter values, we create “sawhorse” plots, with an example in Figure 1.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In our present work, we are focused on changes in cultural fit during the transitions into or out of the group, so we collapse observations outside the first/last six months into a stable point estimate, constraining their slopes to be zero.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This simplification also circumvents the issue of different employees having different middle-period lengths.4
Model structure The graphical model for our instantiation of WHAM is shown in Figure 2.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For each word category c, WHAM’s generative model represents each reply as a series of tokenby-token independent draws from a binomial distribution.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The binomial probability µ is dependent on whether the preceding message did (µalign) or did not (µbase) contain a word from category c, and the inferred alignment value is the difference between these probabilities in log-odds space (ηalign).
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The specific values of these variables depend on three hierarchical features: the word category c, the group g that a given employee falls into, and the time period t (a piece of the piece-wise
in baseline usage over time showed roughly linear changes over the first/last six months, but our linearity assumption may mask interesting variation in the enculturation trajectories.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"4As shown in Figure 1, the pieces do not need to define a continuous function.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Alignment behaviors continue to change in the middle of an employee’s tenure (Srivastava et al., forthcoming), so alignment six months in to the job is unlikely to be equal to alignment six months from leaving, or the average alignment over the middle tenure.
linear function: beginning, middle, or end).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Note that the hierarchical ordering is different for the η chains and the α/β chains; c is above g and t for the η chains, but below them for the α/β chains.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This is because we expect the static (η) values for a given word category to be relatively consistent across different groups and at different times, but we expect the values to be independent across the different word categories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Conversely, we expect that the enculturation trajectories across word categories (α/β) will be similar, while the trajectories may vary substantially across different groups and different times.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Lastly, the month m in which a reply is written (measured from the start of the time period t) has a linear effect on the η value, as described below.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To estimate alignment, we first divide the replies up by group, time period, and calendar month.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We separate the replies into two sets based on whether the preceding message contained the category c (the “alignment” set) or not (the “baseline” set).,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All replies within a set are then aggregated in a single bag-of-words representation, with category token counts Calignc,g,t,m and C base c,g,t,m, and total token counts N basec,g,t,m and N base c,g,t,m comprising the observed variables on the far right of the model.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Moving from right to left, these counts are assumed to come from binomial draws with prob-
ability µalignc,g,t,m or µ base c,g,t,m. The µ values are then in turn generated from η values in log-odds space by an inverse-logit transform, similar to linear predictors in logistic regression.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The ηbase variables are representations of the baseline frequency of a marker in log-odds space, and µbase is simply a conversion of ηbase to probability space, the equivalent of an intercept term in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"ηalign is an additive value, with µalign = logit−1(ηbase + ηalign), the equivalent of a binary feature coefficient in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The specific month’s η variables are calculated as a linear function: ηalignc,g,t,m = η align c,g,t +",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"mαc,g,t, and similarly with β for the baseline.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The remainder of the model is a hierarchy of normal distributions that integrate social structure into the analysis.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In the present work, we have three levels in the hierarchy: category, group, and time period.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In Analysis 1, employees are grouped by their employment outcome (stay, leave voluntarily, leave involuntarily); in Analyses 2 & 3, where we predict the employment outcomes, each group is a single employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The normal distributions that connect these levels have identical standard deviations σ2 = .25.5,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The hierarchies
5The deviation is not a theoretically motivated choice, and was chosen as a good empirical balance between reasonable parameter convergence (improved by smaller σ2) and good model log-probability (improved by larger σ2).
are headed by a normal distribution centered at 0, except for the ηbase hierarchy, which has a Cauchy(0, 2.5) distribution.6
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
Message and reply length can affect alignment estimates; the WHAM model was developed in part to reduce this effect.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"As different employees had different email length distributions, we further accounted for length by dividing all replies into five quintile length bins, and treated each bin as separate observations for each employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This design choice adds an additional control factor, but results were qualitatively similar without it.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All of our analyses are based on parameter estimates from RStan fits of WHAM with 500 iterations over four chains.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"While previous research on cultural fit has emphasized either its internalization (O’Reilly et al., 1991) or self-regulation (Goldberg et al., 2016) components, our extension to the WHAM framework helps disentangle them by estimating them as separate baseline and alignment trajectories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For example, we can distinguish between an archetypal individual who initially aligns to her colleagues and then internalizes this style of communication such that her baseline use also shifts and another archetypal person who aligns to her colleagues but does not change her baseline usage.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The former exhibits high correspondence between internalization and self-regulation, whereas the latter demonstrates an ability to decouple them.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We perform three analyses on this data.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"First, we examine the qualitative behaviors of pronoun alignment and how they map onto employee outcomes in the data.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Second, we show that these qualitative differences in early enculturation are meaningful, with alignment behaviors predicting employment outcome above chance.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we consider lexical versus referential levels of alignment and show that predictions are improved under the referential formulation, suggesting that alignment is not limited to low-level wordrepetition effects.
",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"6As ηbase is the log-odds of each word in a reply being a part of the category c, it is expected to be substantially negative.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"For example, second person pronouns (you), are around 2% of the words in replies, approximately −4 in log-odds space.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
We follow Gelman et al. (2008)’s recommendation of the Cauchy prior as appropriate for parameter estimation in logistic regression.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"We begin with descriptive analyses of the behavior of pronouns, which are likely to reflect incorporation into the company.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"In particular, we look at first-person singular (I), first-person plural (we), and second-person pronouns (you).",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"We expect that increases in we usage will occur as the employee is integrated into the group, while I and you usage will decrease, and want to understand whether these changes manifest on baseline usage (i.e., internalization), alignment (i.e., self-regulation), or both.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Design We divided each employee’s emails by calendar month, and separated them into the employee’s first six months, their last six months (if an employee left the company within the observation period), and the middle of their tenure.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees with fewer than twelve months at the company were excluded from this analysis, so that their first and last months did not overlap.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
We fit two WHAM models in this analysis.,5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The first aggregated all employees, regardless of employment outcome, to minimize noise; the second separated them by outcome to analyze cultural fit differences.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Outcome-aggregated model We start with the aggregated behavior of all employees, shown in Figure 3.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"For baselines, we see decreased use of I
and you over the first six months, with we usage increasing over the same period, confirming the expected result that incorporating into the group is accompanied by more inclusive pronoun usage.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Despite the baseline changes, alignment is fairly stable through the first six months.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Alignment on first-person singular and second-person pronouns is lower than first-person plural pronouns, likely due to the fact that I or you have different referents when used by the two conversants, while both conversants could use we to refer to the same group.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
We will consider this referential alignment in more detail in Analysis 3.,5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Since employees with different outcomes have much different experiences over their last six months, we will not discuss them in aggregate, aside from noting the sharp decline in we alignment near the end of the employees’ tenures.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Outcome-separated model Figure 4 shows outcome-specific trajectories, with green lines showing involuntary leavers (i.e., those who are fired or downsized), blue showing voluntary leavers, and orange showing employees who remained at the company through the final month of the data.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The use of I and you is similar to the aggregates in Figure 3, regardless of group.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The last six months of I usage show an interesting difference, where involuntary leavers align more on I but retain a stable baseline while voluntary leavers retain a stable alignment but increase I overall, which is consistent with group separation.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The most compelling result we see here, though, is the changes in we usage by different groups of employees.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees who eventually leave the
company involuntarily show signs of more selfregulation than internalization over the first six months, increasing their alignment while decreasing their baseline use (though they return to more similar levels as other employees later in their tenure).",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees who stay at the company, as well as those who later leave voluntarily, show signs of internalization, increasing their baseline usage to the company average, as well as adapting their alignment levels to the mean.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"This finding suggests that how quickly the employees internalize culturally-standard language use predicts their eventual employment outcome, even if they eventually end up near the average.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"This analysis tests the hypothesis that there are meaningful differences in employees’ initial enculturation, captured by alignment behaviors.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
We examine the first six months of communications and attempt to predict whether the employee will leave the company.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We find that, even with a simple classifier, alignment behaviors are predictive of employment outcome.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
Design We fit the WHAM model to only the first six months of email correspondence for all employees who had at least six months of email.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"The model estimated the initial level of baseline use (ηbase) and alignment (ηalign) for each employee, as well as the slope (α, β) for baseline and alignment over those first six months, over all 11 word categories mentioned in Section 3.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We then created logistic regression classifiers, using the parameter estimates to predict whether an employee would leave the company.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
We fit separate classifiers for leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our results show that early alignment behaviors are better at identifying employees who will leave involuntarily than voluntarily, consistent with Srivastava et al.’s (forthcoming) findings that voluntary leavers are similar to stayers until late in their tenure.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We fit separate classifiers using the alignment parameters and the baseline parameters to investigate their relative informativity.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"For each model, we report the area under the curve (AUC).",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This value is estimated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate over different classification thresholds.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
An AUC of 0.5 represents chance performance.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We use balanced, stratified cross-
validation to reduce AUC misestimation due to unbalanced outcome frequencies and high noise (Parker et al., 2007).
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Results The left column of Figure 5 shows the results over 10 runs of 10-fold balanced logistic classifiers with stratified cross-validation in R. The alignment-based classifiers are both above chance at predicting that an employee will leave the company, whether involuntarily or voluntarily.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"The baseline-based classifiers perform worse, especially on voluntary leavers.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This finding is consistent with the idea that voluntary leavers resemble stayers (who form the bulk of the employees) until late in their tenure when their cultural fit declines.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We fit a model using both alignment and baseline parameters, but this model yielded an AUC value below the alignment-only classifier.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This suggests that where alignment and baseline behaviors are both predictive, they do not provide substantially different predictive power and lead to overfitting.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
A more sophisticated classifier may overcome these challenges; our goal here was not to achieve maximal classification performance but to test whether alignment provided any useful information about employment outcomes.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our final analysis investigates the nature of linguistic alignment: specifically, whether there is an effect of referential alignment beyond that of the more commonly used lexical alignment.
",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
Testing this hypothesis requires a small change to the alignment calculations.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"Lexical alignment is based on the conditional probability of the replier using a word category c given that the preceding message used that same category c. For referential alignment, we examine the conditional probability of the replier using a word category cj given that the preceding message used the category ci, where ci and cj are likely to be referentially linked.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"We also consider cases where ci is likely to transition to cj throughout the course of the conversation, such as present tense verbs turning into past tense as the event being described recedes into the past.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"The pairs of categories that are likely to be referentially or transitionally linked are: (you, I); (we, I); (you, we); (past, present); (present, future); and (certainty, tentativity).",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"We include both directions of these pairs, so this provides approximately the same number of predictor variables for both situa-
tions to maximize comparability (12 for the referential alignments, 11 for the lexical).",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"This modification does not change the structure of the WHAM model, but rather changes its C and N counts by reclassifying replies between the baseline or alignment pathways.
",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
Results Figure 5 plots the differences in predictive model performance using lexical versus referential alignment parameters.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
We find that the semantic parameters provide more accurate classification than the lexical both for voluntarily and involuntarily-leaving employees.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"This suggests that while previous work looking at lexical alignment successfully captures social structure, referential alignment may reflect a deeper and more accurate representation of the social structure.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"It is unclear if this behavior holds in less formal situations or with weaker organizational structure and shared goals, but these results suggest that the traditional alignment approach of only measuring lexical alignment should be augmented with referential alignment measures for a more complete analysis.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"A key finding from this work is that pronoun usage behaviors in employees’ email communication are consistent with social integration into the group; employees use “I” pronouns less and
“we” pronouns more as they integrate.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we see the importance of using an alignment measure such as WHAM for distinguishing the base rate and alignment usage of words.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Employees who leave the company involuntarily show increased “we” usage through greater alignment, using “we” more when prompted by a colleague, but introducing it less of their own accord.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This suggests that these employees do not feel fully integrated into the group, although they are willing to identify as a part of it when a more fully-integrated group member includes them, corresponding to self-regularization over internalization.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The fact that these alignment measures alone, without any job productivity or performance metrics, have some predictive capability for employees’ leaving the company suggests the potential for support or intervention programs to help highperforming but poorly-integrated employees integrate into the company better.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"More generally, the prominence of pronominally-driven communication changes suggest that alignment analyses can provide insight into a range of social integration settings.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This may be especially helpful in cases where there is great pressure to integrate smoothly, and people would be likely to adopt a self-regulating approach even if they do not internalize their group membership.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Such settings not only include the high-stakes situation of keeping one’s job, but of transitioning from high school to college or moving to a new country or region.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Maximizing the chances for new members to become comfortable within a group is critical both for spreading useful aspects of the group’s existing culture to new members and for integrating new ideas from the new members’ knowledge and practices.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Alignment-based approaches can be a useful tool in separating effective interventions that cause internalization of the group dynamics from those that lead to more superficial self-regularization changes.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
This paper described an effort to use directed linguistic alignment as a measure of cultural fit within an organization.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We adapted a hierarchical alignment model from previous work to estimate fit within corporate email communications, focusing on changes in language during employees’ entry to and exit from the company.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Our results
showed substantial changes in the use of pronouns, with pronoun patterns varying by employees’ outcomes within the company.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
The use of the firstperson plural “we” during an employee’s first six months is particularly instructive.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Whereas stayers exhibited increased baseline use, indicating internalization, those eventually departing involuntarily were on the one hand decreasingly likely to introduce “we” into conversation, but increasingly responsive to interlocutors’ use of the pronoun.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"While not internalizing a shared identity with their peers, involuntarily departed employees were overly self-regulating in response to its invocation by others.
",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Quantitatively, rates of usage and alignment in the first six months of employment carried information about whether employees left involuntarily, pointing towards fit within the company culture early on as an indicator of eventual employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Finally, we saw ways in which the application of alignment to cultural fit might help to refine ideas about alignment itself: preliminary analysis suggested that referential, rather than lexical, alignment was more predictive of employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"More broadly, these results suggest ways that quantitative methods can be used to make precise application of concepts like “cultural fit” at scale.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]

Cultural fit is widely believed to affect the success of individuals and the groups to which they belong.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"Yet it remains an elusive, poorly measured construct.",abstractText,[0],[0]
Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"By contrast, we develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic alignment, which estimates the influence of one person’s word use on another’s and distinguishes between two enculturation mechanisms: internalization and selfregulation.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We use this measure to trace employees’ enculturation trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of individuals downstream outcomes, especially involuntary exit.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"In instruction-following tasks, an agent executes a sequence of actions in a real or simulated environment, in response to a sequence of natural language commands.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Examples include giving navigational directions to robots and providing hints to automated game-playing agents.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Plans specified with natural language exhibit compositionality both at the level of individual actions and at the overall sequence level.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper describes a framework for learning to follow instructions by leveraging structure at both levels.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our primary contribution is a new, alignmentbased approach to grounded compositional semantics.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Building on related logical approaches (Reddy et al., 2014; Pourdamghani et al., 2014), we recast instruction following as a pair of nested, structured alignment problems.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given instructions and a candidate plan, the model infers a sequenceto-sequence alignment between sentences and
atomic actions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Within each sentence–action pair, the model infers a structure-to-structure alignment between the syntax of the sentence and a graphbased representation of the action.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"At a high level, our agent is a block-structured, graph-valued conditional random field, with alignment potentials to relate instructions to actions and transition potentials to encode the environment model (Figure 3).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Explicitly modeling sequenceto-sequence alignments between text and actions allows flexible reasoning about action sequences, enabling the agent to determine which actions are specified (perhaps redundantly) by text, and which actions must be performed automatically (in order to satisfy pragmatic constraints on interpretation).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Treating instruction following as a sequence prediction problem, rather than a series of independent decisions (Branavan et al., 2009; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013), makes it possible to use general-purpose planning machinery, greatly increasing inferential power.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The fragment of semantics necessary to complete most instruction-following tasks is essentially predicate–argument structure, with limited influence from quantification and scoping.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Thus the problem of sentence interpretation can reasonably be modeled as one of finding an alignment between language and the environment it describes.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We allow this structure-to-structure alignment— an “overlay” of language onto the world—to be mediated by linguistic structure (in the form of dependency parses) and structured perception (in what we term grounding graphs).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model thereby reasons directly about the relationship between language and observations of the environment, without the need for an intermediate logical representation of sentence meaning.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This, in turn, makes it possible to incorporate flexible feature representations that have been difficult to integrate with previous work in semantic parsing.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We apply our approach to three established

2 1 3
instruction-following benchmarks: the map reading task of Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), the maze navigation task of MacMahon et al. (2006), and the puzzle solving task of Branavan et al. (2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
An example from each is shown in Figure 1.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These benchmarks exhibit a range of qualitative properties—both in the length and complexity of their plans, and in the quantity and quality of accompanying language.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each task has been studied in isolation, but we are unaware of any published approaches capable of robustly handling all three.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our general model outperforms strong, task-specific baselines in each case, achieving relative error reductions of 15–20% over several state-of-the-art results.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Experiments demonstrate the importance of our contributions in both compositional semantics and search over plans.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We have released all code for this project at github.com/jacobandreas/instructions.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing work on instruction following can be roughly divided into two families: semantic parsers and linear policy estimators.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Semantic parsers Parser-based approaches (Chen and Mooney, 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013; Kim and Mooney, 2013) map from text into a formal language representing commands.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"These take familiar structured prediction models for semantic parsing (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006), and train them with task-provided supervision.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Instead of attempting to match the structure of a manually-annotated semantic parse, semantic parsers for instruction following are trained to maximize a reward signal
provided by black-box execution of the predicted command in the environment.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"(It is possible to think of response-based learning for question answering (Liang et al., 2013) as a special case.)
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"This approach uses a well-studied mechanism for compositional interpretation of language, but is subject to certain limitations.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Because the environment is manipulated only through black-box execution of the completed semantic parse, there is no way to incorporate current or future environment state into the scoring function.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
It is also in general necessary to hand-engineer a task-specific formal language for describing agent behavior.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Thus it is extremely difficult to work with environments that cannot be modeled with a fixed inventory of predicates (e.g. those involving novel strings or arbitrary real quantities).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Much of contemporary work in this family is evaluated on the maze navigation task introduced by MacMahon et al. (2006).,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Dukes (2013) also introduced a “blocks world” task for situated parsing of spatial robot commands.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Linear policy estimators An alternative family of approaches is based on learning a policy over primitive actions directly (Branavan et al., 2009; Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010).1 Policybased approaches instantiate a Markov decision process representing the action domain, and apply standard supervised or reinforcement-learning approaches to learn a function for greedily selecting among actions.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In linear policy approximators, natural language instructions are incorporated directly into state observations, and reading order
1This is distinct from semantic parsers in which greedy inference happens to have an interpretation as a policy (Vlachos and Clark, 2014).
becomes part of the action selection process.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Almost all existing policy-learning approaches make use of an unstructured parameterization, with a single (flat) feature vector representing all text and observations.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Such approaches are thus restricted to problems that are simple enough (and have small enough action spaces) to be effectively characterized in this fashion.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"While there is a great deal of flexibility in the choice of feature function (which is free to inspect the current and future state of the environment, the whole instruction sequence, etc.), standard linear policy estimators have no way to model compositionality in language or actions.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Agents in this family have been evaluated on a variety of tasks, including map reading (Anderson et al., 1991) and gameplay (Branavan et al., 2009).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Though both families address the same class of instruction-following problems, they have been applied to a totally disjoint set of tasks.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"It should be emphasized that there is nothing inherent to policy learning that prevents the use of compositional structure, and nothing inherent to general compositional models that prevents more complicated dependence on environment state.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Indeed, previous work (Branavan et al., 2011; Narasimhan et al., 2015) uses aspects of both to solve a different class of gameplay problems.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In some sense, our goal in this paper is simply to combine the strengths of semantic parsers and linear policy estimators for fully general instruction following.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"As we shall see, however, this requires changes to many aspects of representation, learning and inference.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
We wish to train a model capable of following commands in a simulated environment.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"We do so by presenting the model with a sequence of training pairs (x,y), where each x is a sequence of natural language instructions (x1, x2, . . .",3 Representations,[0],[0]
", xm), e.g.:
(Go down the yellow hall., Turn left., . . . )
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"and each y is a demonstrated action sequence (y1, y2, . . .",3 Representations,[0],[0]
", yn), e.g.:
(rotate(90), move(2), . . . )
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Given a start state, y can equivalently be characterized by a sequence of (state, action, state)
triples resulting from execution of the environment model.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
An example instruction is shown in Figure 2a.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example action, situated in the environment where it occurs, is shown in Figure 2e.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
Our model performs compositional interpretation of instructions by leveraging existing structure inherent in both text and actions.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Thus we interpret xi and yj not as raw strings and primitive actions, but rather as structured objects.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Linguistic structure We assume access to a pretrained parser, and in particular that each of the instructions xi is represented by a tree-structured dependency parse.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example is shown in Figure 2b.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Action structure By analogy to the representation of instructions as parse trees, we assume that each (state, action, state) triple (provided by the environment model) can be characterized by a grounding graph.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
The structure and content of this representation is task-specific.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example grounding graph for the maze navigation task is
shown in Figure 2d.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"The example contains a node corresponding to the primitive action move(2) (in the upper left), and several nodes corresponding to locations in the environment that are visible after the action is performed.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Each node in the graph (and, though not depicted, each edge) is decorated with a list of features.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"These features might be simple indicators (e.g. whether the primitive action performed was move or rotate), real values (the distance traveled) or even string-valued (English-language names of visible landmarks, if available in the environment description).",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Formally, a grounding graph consists of a tuple (V,E,L, fV , fE), with
– V a set of vertices
– E ∈ V × V a set of (directed) edges – L a space of labels (numbers, strings, etc.) – fV : V → 2L a vertex feature function – fE : E → 2L an edge feature function In this paper we have tried to remain agnostic to details of graph construction.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
Our goal with the grounding graph framework is simply to accommodate a wider range of modeling decisions than allowed by existing formalisms.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Graphs might be constructed directly, given access to a structured virtual environment (as in all experiments in this paper), or alternatively from outputs of a perceptual system.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"For our experiments, we have remained as close as possible to task representations described in the existing literature.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Details for each task can be found in the accompanying software package.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Graph-based representations are extremely common in formal semantics (Jones et al., 2012; Reddy et al., 2014), and the version presented here corresponds to a simple generalization of familiar formal methods.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Indeed, if L is the set of all atomic entities and relations, fV returns a unique label for every v ∈ V , and fE always returns a vector with one active feature, we recover the existentially-quantified portion of first order logic exactly, and in this form can implement large parts of classical neo-Davidsonian semantics (Parsons, 1990) using grounding graphs.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Crucially, with an appropriate choice of L this formalism also makes it possible to go beyond settheoretic relations, and incorporate string-valued features (like names of entities and landmarks) and real-valued features (like colors and positions) as well.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
Lexical semantics We must eventually combine features provided by parse trees with features provided by the environment.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Examples here might include simple conjunctions (word=yellow ∧ rgb=(0.5, 0.5, 0.0)) or more complicated computations like edit distance between landmark names and lexical items.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Features of the latter kind make it possible to behave correctly in environments containing novel strings or other features unseen during training.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"This aspect of the syntax–semantics interface has been troublesome for some logic-based approaches: while past work has used related machinery for selecting lexicon entries (Berant and Liang, 2014) or for rewriting logical forms (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), the relationship between text and the environment has ultimately been mediated by a discrete (and indeed finite) inventory of predicates.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Several recent papers have investigated simple grounded models with realvalued output spaces (Andreas and Klein, 2014; McMahan and Stone, 2015), but we are unaware of any fully compositional system in recent literature that can incorporate observations of these kinds.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Formally, we assume access to a joining feature function φ : (2L × 2L)→ Rd.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"As with grounding graphs, our goal is to make the general framework as flexible as possible, and for individual experiments have chosen φ to emulate modeling decisions from previous work.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"As noted in the introduction, we approach instruction following as a sequence prediction problem.",4 Model,[0],[0]
Thus we must place a distribution over sequences of actions conditioned on instructions.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"We decompose the problem into two components, describing interlocking models of “path structure” and “action structure”.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Path structure captures how sequences of instructions give rise to sequences of actions, while action structure captures the compositional relationship between individual utterances and the actions they specify.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Path structure: aligning utterances to actions
The high-level path structure in the model is depicted in Figure 3.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Our goal here is to permit both under- and over-specification of plans, and to expose a planning framework which allows plans to be computed with lookahead (i.e. non-greedily).
",4 Model,[0],[0]
These goals are achieved by introducing a sequence of latent alignments between instructions and actions.,4 Model,[0],[0]
Consider the multi-step example in Figure 1b.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"If the first instruction go down the yellow hall were interpreted immediately, we would have a presupposition failure—the agent is facing a wall, and cannot move forward at all.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Thus an implicit rotate action, unspecified by text, must be performed before any explicit instructions can be followed.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"To model this, we take the probability of a (text, plan, alignment) triple to be log-proportional to the sum of two quantities:
1.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"a path-only score ψ(n; θ) + ∑
j ψ(yj ; θ)
2.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"a path-and-text score, itself the sum of all pair scores ψ(xi, yj ; θ) licensed by the alignment
(1) captures our desire for pragmatic constraints on interpretation, and provides a means of encoding the inherent plausibility of paths.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"We take ψ(n; θ) and ψ(y; θ) to be linear functions of θ. (2) provides context-dependent interpretation of text by means of the structured scoring function ψ(x, y; θ), described in the next section.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Formally, we associate with each instruction xi a sequence-to-sequence alignment variable ai ∈ 1 . . .",4 Model,[0],[0]
n,4 Model,[0],[0]
"(recalling that n is the number of actions).
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Then we have2 p(y,a|x; θ) ∝ exp { ψ(n) + n∑ j=1 ψ(yj)
+",4 Model,[0],[0]
"m∑ i=1 n∑ j=1 1[aj = i] ψ(xi, yj) } (1)
We additionally place a monotonicity constraint on the alignment variables.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"This model is globally normalized, and for a fixed alignment is equivalent to a linear-chain CRF.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"In this sense it is analogous to IBM Model I (Brown et al., 1993), with the structured potentials ψ(xi, yj) taking the place of lexical translation probabilities.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"While alignment models from machine translation have previously been used to align words to fragments of semantic parses (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Pourdamghani et al., 2014), we are unaware of such models being used to align entire instruction sequences to demonstrations.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Action structure: aligning words to percepts Intuitively, this scoring function ψ(x, y) should capture how well a given utterance describes an action.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"If neither the utterances nor the actions had structure (i.e. both could be represented with simple bags of features), we would recover something analogous to the conventional policy-learning approach.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"As structure is essential for some of our tasks, ψ(x, y) must instead fill the role of a semantic parser in a conventional compositional model.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Our choice of ψ(x, y) is driven by the following fundamental assumptions: Syntactic relations approximately represent semantic relations.",4 Model,[0],[0]
Syntactic proximity implies relational proximity.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"In this view, there is an additional hidden structure-tostructure alignment between the grounding graph and the parsed text describing it.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"3 Words line up with nodes, and dependencies line up with relations.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Visualizations are shown in Figure 2c and the zoomed-in portion of Figure 3.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"As with the top-level alignment variables, this approach can viewed as a simple relaxation of a familiar model.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"CCG-based parsers assume that syntactic type strictly determines semantic type,
2Here and the remainder of this paper, we suppress the dependence of the various potentials on θ in the interest of readability.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
3It is formally possible to regard the sequence-tosequence and structure-to-structure alignments as a single (structured) random variable.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"However, the two kinds of alignments are treated differently for purposes of inference, so it is useful to maintain a notational distinction.
and that each lexical item is associated with a small set of functional forms.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Here we simply allow all words to license all predicates, multiple words to specify the same predicate, and some edges to be skipped.",4 Model,[0],[0]
We instead rely on a scoring function to impose soft versions of the hard constraints typically provided by a grammar.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"Related models have previously been used for question answering (Reddy et al., 2014; Pasupat and Liang, 2015).
",4 Model,[0],[0]
For the moment let us introduce variables b to denote these structure-to-structure alignments.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"(As will be seen in the following section, it is straightforward to marginalize over all choices of b.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Thus the structure-to-structure alignments are never explicitly instantiated during inference, and do not appear in the final form of ψ(x, y).)",4 Model,[0],[0]
"For a fixed alignment, we define ψ(x, y, b) according to a recurrence relation.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Let xi be the ith word of the sentence, and let yj be the jth node in the action graph (under some topological ordering).",4 Model,[0],[0]
Let c(i) and c(j) give the indices of the dependents of xi and children of yj respectively.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"Finally, let xik and yjl denote the associated dependency type or relation.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Define a “descendant” function:
d(i, j) = { (k, l) : k ∈ c(i), l ∈ c(j), (k, l) ∈ b}
Then, ψ(xi, yj , b) = exp { θ>φ(xi, yj)
+ ∑
(k,l)∈d(x,y)

"[ θ>φ ( xik, yjl ) · ψ(xk, yl, b)]}
This is just an unnormalized synchronous derivation between x and y—at any aligned (node, word) pair, the score for the entire derivation is the score produced by combining that word and node, times the scores at all the aligned descendants.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Observe that as long as there are no cycles in the dependency parse, it is perfectly acceptable for the relation graph to contain cycles and even self-loops— the recurrence still bottoms out appropriately.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Given a sequence of training pairs (x,y), we wish to find a parameter setting that maximizes p(y|x; θ).",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"If there were no latent alignments a or b, this would simply involve minimization of a convex objective.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
The presence of latent variables complicates things.,5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"Ideally, we would like

"Instead we make a series of variational approximations: first we replace the sum with a maximization, then perform iterated conditional modes, alternating between maximization of the conditional probability of a and θ.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"We begin by initializing θ randomly.
",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"As noted in the preceding section, the variable b does not appear in these equations.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"Conditioned on a, the sum over structure-to-structure ψ(x, y) = ∑ b ψ(x, y, b) can be performed exactly using a simple dynamic program which runs in time O(|x||y|)",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]

"This is Algorithm 1.
",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, θ is optimized using LBFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989).",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"Calculation of the gradient with respect to θ requires computation of a normalizing constant involving the sum over p(x,y′,a) for all y′.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"While in principle the normalizing constant can be computed using the forward algorithm, in practice the state spaces under consideration are so large that even this is intractable.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]

"Meanwhile, maximization of a can be performed exactly using the Viterbi algorithm, without computation of normalizers.
",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
Inference at test time involves a slightly different pair of optimization problems.,5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"We again perform iterated conditional modes, here on the alignments a and the unknown output path y. Maximization of a is accomplished with the Viterbi algorithm, exactly as before; maximization of y also uses the Viterbi algorithm, or a beam search when this is computationally infeasible.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"If bounds on path length are known, it is straightforward to adapt these dynamic programs to efficiently consider paths of all lengths.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"As one of the main advantages of this approach is its generality, we evaluate on several different benchmark tasks for instruction following.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
These exhibit great diversity in both environment structure and language use.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]

"Map reading Our first application is the map navigation task established by Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), based on data collected for a psychological experiment by Anderson et al. (1991) (Figure 1a).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Each training datum consists of a map with a designated starting position, and a collection of landmarks, each labeled with a spatial coordinate and a string name.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Names are not always unique, and landmarks in the test set are never observed during training.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This map is accompanied by a set of instructions specifying a path from the starting position to some (unlabeled) destination point.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"These instruction sets are informal and redundant, involving as many as a hundred utterances.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"They are transcribed from spoken text, so grammatical errors, disfluencies, etc. are common.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This is a
prime example of a domain that does not lend itself to logical representation—grammars may be too rigid, and previously-unseen landmarks and real-valued positions are handled more easily with feature machinery than predicate logic.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The map task was previously studied by Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), who implemented SARSA with a simple set of features.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"By combining these features with our alignment model and search procedure, we achieve state-of-the-art results on this task by a substantial margin (Table 1).
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Some learned feature values are shown in Table 2.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The model correctly infers cardinal directions (the example shows the preferred side of a destination landmark modified by the word top).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Like Vogel et al., we see support for both allocentric references (you are on top of the hill) and egocentric references (the hill is on top of you).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We can also see pragmatics at work: the model learns useful text-independent constraints—in this case, that near destinations should be preferred to far ones.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Maze navigation The next application we consider is the maze navigation task of MacMahon et al. (2006) (Figure 1b).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, a virtual agent is sit-
uated in a maze (whose hallways are distinguished with various wallpapers, carpets, and the presence of a small set of standard objects), and again given instructions for getting from one point to another.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This task has been the subject of focused attention in semantic parsing for several years, resulting in a variety of sophisticated approaches.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Despite superficial similarity to the previous navigation task, the language and plans required for this task are quite different.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The proportion of instructions to actions is much higher (so redundancy much lower), and the interpretation of language is highly compositional.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in Table 3, we outperform a number of systems purpose-built for this navigation task.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also outperform both variants of our system, most conspicuously the variant without grounding graphs.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This highlights the importance of compositional structure.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Recent work by Kim and Mooney (2013) and Artzi et al. (2014) has achieved better results; these systems make use of techniques and resources (respectively, discriminative reranking and a seed lexicon of handannotated logical forms) that are largely orthogonal to the ones used here, and might be applied to improve our own results as well.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Puzzle solving The last task we consider is the Crossblock task studied by Branavan et al. (2009) (Figure 1c).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, again, natural language is used to specify a sequence of actions, in this case the solution to a simple game.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The environment is simple enough to be captured with a flat feature

",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"representation, so there is no distinction between the full model and the variant without grounding graphs.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Unlike the other tasks we consider, Crossblock is distinguished by a challenging associated search problem.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Here it is nontrivial to find any sequence that eliminates all the blocks (the goal of the puzzle).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Thus this example allows us measure the effectiveness of our search procedure.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Results are shown in Table 4.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task when attempting to match the humanspecified plan exactly.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"If we are purely concerned with task completion (i.e. solving the puzzle, perhaps not with the exact set of moves specified in the instructions) we can measure this directly.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, too, we substantially outperform a no-text baseline.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Thus it can be seen that text induces a useful heuristic, allowing the model to solve a considerable fraction of problem instances not solved by naı̈ve beam search.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The problem of inducing planning heuristics from side information like text is an important one in its own right, and future work might focus specifically on coupling our system with a more sophisticated planner.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Even at present, the results in this section demonstrate the importance of lookahead and high-level reasoning in instruction following.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We have described a new alignment-based compositional model for following sequences of natural language instructions, and demonstrated the effectiveness of this model on a variety of tasks.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"A fully general solution to the problem of contextual interpretation must address a wide range of wellstudied problems, but the work we have described
here provides modular interfaces for the study of a number of fundamental linguistic issues from a machine learning perspective.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"These include:
Pragmatics How do we respond to presupposition failures, and choose among possible interpretations of an instruction disambiguated only by context?",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The mechanism provided by the sequence-prediction architecture we have described provides a simple answer to this question, and our experimental results demonstrate that the learned pragmatics aid interpretation of instructions in a number of concrete ways: ambiguous references are resolved by proximity in the map reading task, missing steps are inferred from an environment model in the maze navigation task, and vague hints are turned into real plans by knowledge of the rules in Crossblock.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"A more comprehensive solution might explicitly describe the process by which instruction-givers’ own beliefs (expressed as distributions over sequences) give rise to instructions.
",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Compositional semantics,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The graph alignment model of semantics presented here is an expressive and computationally efficient generalization of classical logical techniques to accommodate environments like the map task, or those explored in our previous work (Andreas and Klein, 2014).",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"More broadly, our model provides a compositional approach to semantics that does not require an explicit formal language for encoding sentence meaning.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Future work might extend this approach to tasks like question answering, where logicbased approaches have been successful.
",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Our primary goal in this paper has been to explore methods for integrating compositional semantics and the pragmatic context provided by sequential structures.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"While there is a great deal of work left to do, we find it encouraging that this general approach results in substantial gains across multiple tasks and contexts.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"With more than one hundred thousand new scholarly articles being published each year, there is a rapid growth in the number of citations for the relevant scientific articles.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this context, we highlight the following interesting facts about the process of citing scientific articles: (i) the most commonly cited paper by Gerard Salton, titled “A Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval” (alleged to have been published in 1975) does not actually exist in reality (Dubin, 2004), (ii) the scientific authors read only 20% of the works they cite (Simkin and Roychowdhury, 2003), (iii) one third of the refer-
ences in a paper are redundant and 40% are perfunctory (Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975), (iv) 62.7% of the references could not be attributed a specific function (definition, tool etc.)",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"(Teufel et al., 2006).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite these facts, the existing bibliographic metrics consider that all citations are equally significant.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we would emphasize the fact that all the references of a paper are not equally influential.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, we believe that for our current paper, (Wan and Liu, 2014) is more influential reference than (Garfield, 2006), although the former has received lower citations (9) than the latter (1650) so far1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore the influence of a cited paper completely depends upon the context of the citing paper, not the overall citation count of the cited paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We further took the opinion of the original authors of few selective papers and realized that around 16% of the references in a paper are highly influential, and the rest are trivial (Section 4).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This motivates us to design a prediction model, GraLap to automatically label the influence of a cited paper with respect to a citing paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here, we label paper-reference pairs rather than references alone, because a reference that is influential for one citing paper may not be influential with equal extent for another citing paper.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We experiment with ACL Anthology Network (AAN) dataset and show that GraLap along with the novel feature set, quite efficiently, predicts the intensity of references of papers, which achieves (Pearson) correlation of 0.90 with the human annotations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, we present four interesting appli-

cations to show the efficacy of considering unequal intensity of references, compared to the uniform intensity.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The contributions of the paper are four-fold: (i) we acquire a rich annotated dataset where paperreference pairs are labeled based on the influence scores (Section 4), which is perhaps the first goldstandard for this kind of task; (ii) we propose a graph-based label propagation model GraLap for semi-supervised learning which has tremendous potential for any task where the training set is less in number and labels are non-uniformly distributed (Section 3); (iii) we propose a diverse set of features (Section 3.3); most of them turn out to be quite effective to fit into the prediction model and yield improved results (Section 5); (iv) we present four applications to show how incorporating the reference intensity enhances the performance of several stateof-the-art systems (Section 6).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
All the references of a paper usually do not carry equal intensity/strength with respect to the citing paper because some papers have influenced the research more than others.,2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"To pin down this intuition, here we discretize the reference intensity by numerical values within the range of 1 to 5, (5: most influential, 1: least influential).",2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"The appropriate definitions of different labels of reference intensity are presented in Figure 1, which are also the basis of building the annotated dataset (see Section 4):
Note that “reference intensity” and “reference similarity” are two different aspects.",2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
It might happen that two similar reference are used with different intensity levels in a citing paper – while one is just mentioned somewhere in the paper and other is used as a baseline.,2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"Here, we address the former problem as a semi-supervised learning problem with clues taken from content of the citing and cited papers.",2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"In this section, we formally define the problem and introduce our prediction model.",3 Reference Intensity Prediction Model,[0],[0]
"We are given a set of papers P = {P1, P2, ..., PM} and a sets of references R = {R1, R2, ..., RM}, where Ri corresponds to the set of references (or cited papers) of Pi.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"There is a set of papers PL ∈ P whose references RL ∈ R are already labeled by ` ∈ L = {1, ..., 5} (each reference is labeled with exactly one value).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Our objective is to define a predictive function f that labels the references RU ∈ {R \ RL} of the papers PU ∈ {P \ PL} whose reference intensities are unknown, i.e., f : (P,R, PL, RL, PU , RL) −→ L.
Since the size of the annotated (labeled) data is much smaller than unlabeled data (|PL| |PU |), we consider it as a semi-supervised learning problem.

"Each entry x ∈ X is represented by a set of features {f1, f2, ..., fD}.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"The problem is to determine the unknown labels using X and YL.
3.2 GraLap: A Prediction Model We propose GraLap, a variant of label propagation (LP) model proposed by (Zhu et al., 2003) where a node in the graph propagates its associated label to its neighbors based on the proximity.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
We intend to assign same label to the vertices which are closely connected.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"However unlike the traditional LP model where the original values of the labels continue to fade as the algorithm progresses, we systematically handle this problem in GraLap.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Additionally, we follow a post-processing in order to handle “classimbalance problem”.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Graph Creation.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"The algorithm starts with the creation of a fully connected weighted graph G = (X,E) where nodes are data points and the weight wij of each edge eij ∈ E is determined by the radial basis function as follows:

"Later in this section, we shall discuss how σ is selected.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Each node is allowed to propagate its label to its neighbors through edges (the more the edge weight, the easy to propagate).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Transition Matrix.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]

Label Matrix.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Here, we allow a soft label (interpreted as a distribution of labels) to be associated with each node.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"We then define a label matrix Y|X|×|L|, where ith row indicates the label distribution for node xi.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Initially, Y contains only the values of the labeled data; others are zero.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Label Propagation Algorithm.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"This algorithm works as follows:
After initializing Y and T , the algorithm starts by disseminating the label from one node to its neighbors (including self-loop) in one step (Step 3).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Then we normalize each entry of Y by the sum of its cor-

Step 5 is crucial; here we want the labeled sources XL to be persistent.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"During the iterations, the initial labeled nodes XL may fade away with other labels.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Therefore we forcefully restore their actual label by setting yil = 1 (if xi ∈ XL is originally labeled as l), and other entries (∀j 6=lyij) by zero.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
We keep on “pushing” the labels from the labeled data points which in turn pushes the class boundary through high density data points and settles in low density space.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"In this way, our approach intelligently uses the unlabeled data in the intermediate steps of the learning.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Assigning Final Labels.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Once YU is computed, one may take the most likely label from the label distribution for each unlabeled data.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"However, this approach does not guarantee the label proportion observed in the annotated data (which in this case is not well-separated as shown in Section 4).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we adopt a label-based normalization technique.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Assume that the label proportions in the labeled data are c1, ..., c|L| (s.t. ∑|L| i=1",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
ci = 1).,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"In case of YU , we try to balance the label proportion observed in the ground-truth.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"The label mass is the column sum of YU , denoted by YU.1 , ..., YU.|L| , each of which is scaled in such a way that YU.1 : ... : YU.|L| = c1 : ... : c|L|.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
The label of an unlabeled data point is finalized as the label with maximum value in the row of Y .,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Convergence.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Here we briefly show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]

The hardest challenge in this task is that there is no publicly available dataset where references are annotated with the intensity value.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we constructed our own annotated dataset in two different ways.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
(i) Expert Annotation: we requested members of our research group4 to participate in this survey.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"To facilitate the labeling process, we designed a portal where all the papers present in our dataset are enlisted in a drop-down menu.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Upon selecting a paper, its corresponding references were shown with five possible intensity values.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
The citing and cited papers are also linked to the original texts so that the annotators can read the original papers.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
A total of 20 researchers participated and they were asked to label as many paperreference pairs as they could based on the definitions of the intensity provided in Section 2.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
The annotation process went on for one month.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Out of total 1640 pairs annotated, 1270 pairs were taken such that each pair was annotated by at least two annotators, and the final intensity value of the pair was considered to be the average of the scores.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
The Pearson correlation and Kendell’s τ among the annotators are 0.787 and 0.712 respectively.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
(ii) Author Annotation: we believe that the authors of a paper are the best experts to judge the intensity of references present in the paper.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"With this intension, we launched a survey where we requested the authors whose papers are present in our dataset with significant numbers.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
We designed a web portal in similar fashion mentioned earlier; but each author was only shown her own papers in the drop-down menu.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Out of 35 requests, 22 authors responded and total 196 pairs are annotated.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]

Influential papers in a particular area are often discovered by considering equal weights to all the citations of a paper.,6.1 Discovering Influential Articles,[0],[0]

"To show this, Here we use the following measures individually to compute the influence of a paper: (i) RawCite: total number of citations per paper, (ii) RawPR: we construct a citation network (nodes: papers, links: citations), and measure PageRank (Page et al., 1998) of each node n: PR(n) = 1−qN + q ∑ m∈M(n) PR(m)",6.1 Discovering Influential Articles,[0],[0]

However they too could benefit from filtering or weighting references with a model of influence.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]

"To score sentences, we use a scoring function based on Naı̈ve Bayes classification.",2 Related works,[0],[0]

MT evaluation metrics are tested for correlation with human judgments either at the sentence- or the corpus-level. Trained metrics ignore corpus-level judgments and are trained for high sentence-level correlation only. We show that training only for one objective (sentence or corpus level), can not only harm the performance on the other objective, but it can also be suboptimal for the objective being optimized. To this end we present a metric trained for corpus-level and show empirical comparison against a metric trained for sentencelevel exemplifying how their performance may vary per language pair, type and level of judgment. Subsequently we propose a model trained to optimize both objectives simultaneously and show that it is far more stable than–and on average outperforms– both models on both objectives.",text,[0],[0]
"Ever since BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) many proposals for an improved automatic evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) have been made.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Some proposals use additional information for extracting quality indicators, like paraphrasing (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), syntactic trees (Liu and Gildea, 2005; Stanojević and Sima’an, 2015) or shallow semantics (Rios et al., 2011; Lo et al., 2012) etc.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Whereas others use different matching strategies, like n-grams (Papineni et al., 2002), treelets (Liu and Gildea, 2005) and skip-bigrams (Lin and Och, 2004).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most metrics use several indicators of translation quality which are often combined in a linear model whose weights are estimated on a training set of human judgments.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Because the most widely available type of human judgments are relative ranking (RR) judgments, the main machine learning method used for training the metrics were based on the learningto-rank framework (Li, 2011).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the effectiveness of this framework for training evaluation metrics has been confirmed many times, e.g., (Ye et al., 2007; Duh, 2008; Stanojević and Sima’an, 2014; Ma et al., 2016), so far there is no prior work exploring alternative objective functions for training learning-to-rank models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Without exception, all existing learning-to-rank models are trained to rank sentences while completely ignoring the corpora judgments, likely because human judgments come in the form of sentence rankings.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It might seem that sentence and corpus level tasks are very similar but that is not the case.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Empirically it has been shown that many metrics that perform well on the sentence level do not perform well on the corpus level and vice versa.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"By training to rank sentences the model does not necessarily learn to give scores that are well scaled, but only to give higher scores to better translations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Training for the corpus level score would force the metric to give well scaled scores on the sentence level.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Human judgments of sentences can be aggregated in different ways to hypothesize human judgments of full corpora.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this fact has not been used so far to train learning-to-rank models that are good for ranking different corpora.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This work fills-in this gap by exploring the merits of different objective functions that take corpus level judgments into consideration.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We first create a learning-to-rank model for ranking corpora and compare it to the standard learning-to-rank model that is trained for ranking sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This comparison shows that performance of these two objectives can vary radically depending on the chosen meta-evaluation method.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To tackle this prob-
20
lem we contribute a new objective function, inspired by multi-task learning, in which we train for both objectives simultaneously.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This multiobjective model behaves a lot more stable over all methods of meta-evaluation and achieves a higher correlation than both single objective models.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"All the models that we define have one basic function in common, we call it a forward(·) function, that maps the features of any sentence to a single real number.",2 Models,[0],[0]
"That function can be any differentiable function including multi-layer neural networks as in (Ma et al., 2016), but here we will stick with the standard linear model:
forward(φ) = φTw + b
Here φ is a vector with feature values of a sentence, w is a weight vector and b is a bias term.",2 Models,[0],[0]
"Usually in training we would like to process a mini-batch of feature vectors Φ, where Φ is a matrix in which each column is a feature vector of individual sentence in the mini-batch or in the corpus.",2 Models,[0],[0]
"By using broadcasting we can rewrite the previous definition of the forward(·) function as:
forward(Φ) = ΦTw + b
Now we can define the score of a sentence as a sigmoid function applied over the output of the forward(·) function because we want to get a score between 0 and 1:
sentScore(φ) = σ(forward(φ))
",2 Models,[0],[0]
"As the corpus level score we will use just the average of sentence level scores:
corpScore(Φ) = 1
m
∑ sentScore(Φ)
where m is the number of sentences in the corpus.",2 Models,[0],[0]
Next we present several objective functions that are illustrated by the computation graph in Figure 1.,2 Models,[0],[0]
"Here we use the training objective very similar to BEER (Stanojević and Sima’an, 2014) which is a learning-to-rank framework that finds a separating hyper-plane between “good” and “bad” translations.",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"Unlike BEER, we use a max-margin objective instead of logistic regression.
",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
For each mini-batch we randomly select m human relative ranking pairwise judgments and after extracting features for all the sentences taking part in these judgments we put features in two matrices Φswin and Φslos.,2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"These matrices are structured in such a way that for judgment i the column i in Φswin contains the features of the “good” translation in the judgment and the column i in Φslos the features of the “bad” translation.
",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
We would like to maximize the average margin that would separate sentence level scores of pairs of translations in each judgment.,2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"Because the squashing sigmoid function does not influence the ranking we can directly optimize on the unsquashed forward pass and require that the margin between “good” and “bad” translation is at least 1:
∆sent = forward(Φswin)− forward(Φslos)
",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"LossSent = 1
m
∑ max(0, 1−∆sent)",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
At the corpus level we would like to do a similar thing as on the sentence level: maximize the distance between the scores of “good” and “bad” corpora.,2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"In this case we have additional information that is not present on the sentence level: we know not only which corpus is (according to humans) better, but also by how much it is better.",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"For
that we can use one of the heuristics such as the Expected Wins (Koehn, 2012).",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"We can use this information to guide the learning model by how much it should separate the scores of two corpora.
",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"For doing this we use an approach similar to Max-Margin Markov Networks (Taskar et al., 2003) where for each training instance we dynamically scale the margin that should be enforced.",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
We want the margin between the scores ∆corp to be at least as big as the margin between the human scores ∆human assigned to these systems.,2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
In one mini-batch we will use only a randomly chosen pair of corpora with feature matrices Φcwin and Φclos for which we have a human comparison.,2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"The corpus level loss function is given by:
∆corp = corpScore(Φcwin)− corpScore(Φclos) LossCorp = max(0,∆human −∆corp)",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"In this model we optimize both objectives jointly in the style of multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997).",2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"Here we employ the simplest approach of just tasking the interpolation of the previously introduced loss functions.
",2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
LossJoint = α · LossSent + (1− α) ·,2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"LossCorp
The interpolation is controlled by the hyperparameter α which could in principle be tuned for good performance, but here we just fix it to 0.5 to give both objectives equal importance.",2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
The feature functions that are used are reimplementation of many (but not all) feature functions of BEER.,2.4 Feature Functions,[0],[0]
"Because the point of this paper is about the exploration of different objective functions we did not try to experiment with more complex feature functions based on paraphrasing, function words or permutation trees.

"We use just simple precision, recall and 3 types of F-score (with β parameters 1, 2 and 0.5) over different “pieces” of translation:

"Experiments are conducted on WMT13 (Macháček and Bojar, 2013), WMT14 (Machacek and Bojar, 2014) and WMT16 (Bojar et al., 2016) datasets which were used as training, validation and testing datasets respectively.

All of the models are implemented using TensorFlow1 and trained with L2 regularization λ = 0.001 and ADAM optimizer with learning rate 0.001.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]

We show the results for the relative ranking (RR) judgments correlation in Table 1.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]

"RR corpus vs. sentence objective The corpusobjective is better than the sentence-objective for both corpus and sentence level RR judgments on 5 out of 7 languages and also on average correlation.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"RR joint vs. single-objectives Training for the joint objective improves even more on both levels of RR correlation and outperforms both singleobjective models on average and on 4 out of 7 languages.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Making confident conclusions from these results is difficult because, to the best of our knowledge, there is no principled way of measuring statistical significance on the RR judgments.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
That is why we also tested on direct assessment (DA) judgments available from WMT16.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On DA we can measure statistical significance on the sentence level using Williams test (Graham et al., 2015) and on the corpus level using combination of hybrid-supersampling and Williams test (Graham and Liu, 2016).",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The results of correlation with human judgment are for sentence and corpus level are shown in Table 2.

DA corpus vs. other objectives On DA judgments the results for corpus level objective are completely different than on the RR judgments.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On DA judgments the corpus-objective model is significantly outperformed on both levels and on all languages by both of the other objectives.

This shows that gambling on one objective function (being that sentence or corpus level objective) could give unpredictable results.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is precisely the motivation for creating the joint model with multi-objective training.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
DA joint vs. single objectives By choosing to jointly optimize both objectives we get a much more stable model that performs well both on DA and RR judgments and on both levels of judgment.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On the DA sentence level, the joint model was not outperformed by any other model and on 3 out of 7 language pairs it significantly outperforms both alternative objectives.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On the corpus level results are
a bit mixed, but still joint objective outperforms both other models on 4 out of 7 language pairs and also it gives higher correlation on average.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
In this work we found that altering the objective function for training MT metrics can have radical effects on performance.,4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Also the effects of the objective functions can sometimes be unexpected: the sentence objective might not be good for sentence level correlation (in case of RR judgments) and the corpus objective might not be good for corpus level correlation (in case of DA judgments).,4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The difference among objectives is better explained by different types of human judgments: the corpus objective is better for RR while sentence objective is better for DA judgments.
",4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Finally, the best results are achieved by training for both objectives at the same time.",4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This gives
an evaluation metric that is far more stable in its performance over all methods of meta-evaluation.",4 Conclusion,[0],[0]

MT evaluation metrics are tested for correlation with human judgments either at the sentenceor the corpus-level.,abstractText,[0],[0]
Trained metrics ignore corpus-level judgments and are trained for high sentence-level correlation only.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"We show that training only for one objective (sentence or corpus level), can not only harm the performance on the other objective, but it can also be suboptimal for the objective being optimized.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"To this end we present a metric trained for corpus-level and show empirical comparison against a metric trained for sentencelevel exemplifying how their performance may vary per language pair, type and level of judgment.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"Over the past few years, Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs, Banarescu et al. (2013)) have become a popular target representation for semantic parsing.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
AMRs are graphs which describe the predicate-argument structure of a sentence.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Because they are graphs and not trees, they can capture reentrant semantic relations, such as those induced by control verbs and coordination.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, it is technically much more challenging to parse a string into a graph than into a tree.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, grammar-based approaches (Peng et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015) require the induction of a grammar from the training corpus, which is hard because graphs can be decomposed into smaller pieces in far more ways than trees.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Neural sequence-to-sequence models, which do very well on string-to-tree parsing (Vinyals et al., 2014), can be applied to AMRs but face the challenge that graphs cannot easily be represented as sequences (van Noord and Bos, 2017a,b).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we tackle this challenge by making the compositional structure of the AMR explicit.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As in our previous work, Groschwitz et al. (2017), we view an AMR as consisting of atomic graphs representing the meanings of the individual words,
which were combined compositionally using linguistically motivated operations for combining a head with its arguments and modifiers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We represent this structure as terms over the AM algebra as defined in Groschwitz et al. (2017).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This previous work had no parser; here we show that the terms of the AM algebra can be viewed as dependency trees over the string, and we train a dependency parser to map strings into such trees, which we then evaluate into AMRs in a postprocessing step.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The dependency parser relies on type information, which encodes the semantic valencies of the atomic graphs, to guide its decisions.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More specifically, we combine a neural supertagger for identifying the elementary graphs for the individual words with a neural dependency model along the lines of Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016) for identifying the operations of the algebra.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
One key challenge is that the resulting term of the AM algebra must be semantically well-typed.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This makes the decoding problem NP-complete.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present two approximation algorithms: one which takes the unlabeled dependency tree as given, and one which assumes that all dependencies are projective.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We evaluate on two data sets, achieving state-of-the-art results on one and near state-of-theart results on the other (Smatch f-scores of 71.0 and 70.2 respectively).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our approach clearly outperforms strong but non-compositional baselines.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Plan of the paper.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"After reviewing related work in Section 2, we explain the AM algebra in Section 3 and extend it to a dependency view in Section 4.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We explain model training in Section 5 and decoding in Section 6.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Section 7 evaluates a number of variants of our system.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recently, AMR parsing has generated considerable research activity, due to the availability of large-
scale annotated data (Banarescu et al., 2013) and two successful SemEval Challenges (May, 2016; May and Priyadarshi, 2017).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Methods from dependency parsing have been shown to be very successful for AMR parsing.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For instance, the JAMR parser (Flanigan et al., 2014, 2016) distinguishes concept identification (assigning graph fragments to words) from relation identification (adding graph edges which connect these fragments), and solves the former with a supertagging-style method and the latter with a graph-based dependency parser.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Foland and Martin (2017) use a variant of this method based on an intricate neural model, yielding state-of-the-art results.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We go beyond these approaches by explicitly modeling the compositional structure of the AMR, which allows the dependency parser to combine AMRs for the words using a small set of universal operations, guided by the types of these AMRs.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Other recent methods directly implement a dependency parser for AMRs, e.g. the transitionbased model of Damonte et al. (2017), or postprocess the output of a dependency parser by adding missing edges (Du et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast to these, our model makes no strong assumptions on the dependency parsing algorithm that is used; here we choose that of Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The commitment of our parser to derive AMRs compositionally mirrors that of grammar-based AMR parsers (Artzi et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In particular, there are parallels between the types we use in the AM algebra and CCG categories (see Section 3 for details).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As a neural system, our parser struggles less with coverage issues than these, and avoids the complex grammar induction process these models require.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More generally, our use of semantic types to restrict our parser is reminiscent of Kwiatkowski et al. (2010), Krishnamurthy et al. (2017) and Zhang et al. (2017), and the idea of deriving semantic representations from dependency trees is also present in Reddy et al. (2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"A core idea of this paper is to parse a string into a graph by instead parsing a string into a dependencystyle tree representation of the graph’s compositional structure, represented as terms of the ApplyModify (AM) algebra (Groschwitz et al., 2017).
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The values of the AM algebra are annotated s-
graphs, or as-graphs: directed graphs with node and edge labels in which certain nodes have been designated as sources (Courcelle and Engelfriet, 2012) and annotated with type information.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Some examples of as-graphs are shown in Fig. 1.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Each as-graph has exactly one root, indicated by the bold outline.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The sources are indicated by red labels; for instance, Gwant has an S-source and an O-source.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The annotations, written in square brackets behind the red source names, will be explained below.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"We use these sources to mark open argument slots; for example, Gsleep in Fig. 1 represents an intransitive verb, missing its subject, which will be added at the S-source.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The AM algebra can combine as-graphs with each other using two linguistically motivated operations: apply and modify.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Apply (APP) adds an argument to a predicate.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, we can add a subject – the graph Gwriter in Fig. 1 – to the graph GVP in Fig. 2d using APPS, yielding the complete AMR in Fig. 2b.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Linguistically, this is like filling the subject (S) slot of the predicate wants to sleep soundly with the argument the writer.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In general, for a source a, APPa(GP , GA), combines the asgraph GP representing a predicate, or head, with the as-graph GA, which represents an argument.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"It does this by plugging the root node of GA into the a-source u of GP – that is, the node u of GP marked with source a.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The root of the resulting as-graph G is the root of GP , and we remove the a marking on u, since that slot is now filled.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The modify operation (MOD) adds a modifier to a graph.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, we can combine two elementary graphs from Fig. 1 with MODm (Gsleep, Gsound), yielding the graph in Fig. 2c.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The Msource of the modifier Gsoundly attaches to the root of Gsleep.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The root of the result is the same as the root of Gsleep in the same sense that a verb phrase with an adverb modifier is still a verb phrase.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In general, MODa(GH , GM ), combines a head GH with a modifier GM .",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
It plugs the root of GH into the a-source u of GM .,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Although this may add incoming edges to the root of GH , that node is still
the root of the resulting graph G. We remove the a marking from GM .
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In both APP and MOD, if there is any other source b which is present in both graphs, the nodes marked with b are unified with each other.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, when Gwant is O-applied to t1 in Fig. 2d, the S-sources of the graphs for “want” and “sleep soundly” are unified into a single node, creating a reentrancy.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"This falls out of the definition of merge for s-graphs which formally underlies both operations (see (Courcelle and Engelfriet, 2012)).
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Finally, the AM algebra uses types to restrict its operations.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Here we define the type of an as-graph as the set of its sources with their annotations1; thus for example, in Fig. 1, the graph for “writer” has the empty type [ ],Gsleep has type [S], andGwant has type [S, O[S]].",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Each source in an as-graph specifies with its annotation the type of the as-graph which is plugged into it via APP.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In other words, for a source a, we may only a-apply GP with GA if the annotation of the a-source in GP matches the type of GA.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, the O-source of Gwants (Fig. 1) requires that we plug in an as-graph of type [S]; observe that this means that the reentrancy in Fig.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
2b is lexically specified by the control verb “want”.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"All other source nodes in Fig. 1 have no annotation, indicating a type requirement of [ ].
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Linguistically, modification is optional; we therefore want the modified graph to be derivationally just like the unmodified graph, in that exactly the same operations can apply to it.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In a typed algebra, this means MOD should not change the type of the head.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"MODa therefore requires that the modifier GM have no sources not already present in the head GH , except a, which will be deleted anyway.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"As in any algebra, we can build terms from constants (denoting elementary as-graphs) by recursively combining them with the operations of the AM algebra.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"By evaluating the operations bottomup, we obtain an as-graph as the value of such a term; see Fig. 2 for an example.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"However, as discussed above, an operation in the term may be undefined due to a type mismatch.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
We call an AMterm well-typed if all its operations are defined.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Every well-typed AM-term evaluates to an as-graph.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Since the applicability of an AM operation depends only on the types, we also write τ = f(τ1, τ2) if as-graphs of type τ1 and τ2 can be combined with the operation f and the result has type τ .
1See (Groschwitz et al., 2017) for a more formally complete definition.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Relationship to CCG.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
There is close relationship between the types of the AM algebra and the categories of CCG.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"A type [S, O] specifies that the as-graph needs to be applied to two arguments to be semantically complete, similar a CCG category such as S\NP/NP, where a string needs to be applied to two NP arguments to be syntactically complete.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"However, AM types govern the combination of graphs, while CCG categories control the combination of strings.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"This relieves AM types of the need to talk about word order; there are no “forward” or “backward” slashes in AM types, and a smaller set of operations.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Also, the AM algebra spells out raising and control phenomena more explicitly in the types.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we connect AM terms to the input string w for which we want to produce a graph.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"We do this in an indexed AM term, exemplified in Fig. 3a.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"We assume that every elementary as-graph G at a leaf represents the meaning of an individual word token wi in w, and write G[i] to annotate the leaf G with the index i of this token.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"This induces a connection between the nodes of the AMR and the tokens of the string, in that the label of each node was contributed by the elementary as-graph of exactly one token.
",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
We define the head index of a subtree t to be the index of the token which contributed the root of the as-graph to which t evaluates.,4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"For a leaf with annotation i, the head index is i; for an APP or MOD node, the head index is the head index of the left child, i.e. of the head argument.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
We annotate each APP and MOD operation with the head index of the left and right subtree.,4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"We can represent indexed AM terms more compactly as AM dependency trees, as shown in Fig.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
3b.,4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
The nodes of such a dependency tree are the tokens of w. We draw an edge with label f from i to k if there is a node with label f,4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"[i, k] in the indexed AM term.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"For example, the tree in 3b has an edge labeled MODm from 5 (Gsleep) to 6 (Gsoundly) because there is a node in the term in 3a labeled MODm[5, 6].",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"The same AM dependency tree may represent multiple indexed AM terms, because the order of apply and modify operations is not specified in the dependency tree.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]

"As a special case, we allow the constant ⊥, which represents a dummy as-graph (of type ⊥) which we use as the semantic value of words without a semantic value in the AMR.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"We furthermore allow the edge label IGNORE in an AM dependency tree, where IGNORE(τ1, τ2) = τ1 if τ2 = ⊥ and is undefined otherwise; in particular, an AM dependency tree with IGNORE edges is only well-typed if all IGNORE edges point into ⊥ nodes.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"We keep all other operations f(τ1, τ2) as is, i.e. they are undefined if either τ1 or τ2 is⊥, and never yield ⊥ as a result.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"When reconstructing an AM term from the AM dependency tree, we skip IGNORE edges, such that the subtree below them will not contribute to the overall AMR.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"In order to train a model that parses sentences into AM dependency trees, we need to convert an AMR corpus – in which sentences are annotated with AMRs – into a treebank of AM dependency trees.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We do this in three steps: first, we break each AMR up into elementary graphs and identify their roots; second, we assign sources and annotations to make elementary as-graphs out of them; and third, combine them into indexed AM terms.
",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"For the first step, an aligner uses hand-written heuristics to identify the string token to which each
node in the AMR corresponds (see Section C in the Supplementary Materials for details).",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We proceed in a similar fashion as the JAMR aligner (Flanigan et al., 2014), i.e. by starting from high-confidence token-node pairs and then extending them until the whole AMR is covered.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"Unlike the JAMR aligner, our heuristics ensure that exactly one node in each elementary graph is marked as the root, i.e. as the node where other graphs can attach their edges through APP and MOD.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"When an edge connects nodes of two different elementary graphs, we use the “blob decomposition” algorithm of Groschwitz et al. (2017) to decide to which elementary graph it belongs.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"For the example AMR in Fig. 2b, we would obtain the graphs in Fig. 1 (without source annotations).",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"Note that ARG edges belong with the nodes at which they start, whereas the “manner” edge in Gsoundly goes with its target.
",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
In the second step we assign source names and annotations to the unlabeled nodes of each elementary graph.,4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
Note that the annotations are crucial to our system’s ability to generate graphs with reentrancies.,4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We mostly follow the algorithm of Groschwitz et al. (2017), which determines necessary annotations based on the structure of the given graph.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
The algorithm chooses each source name depending on the incoming edge label.,4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"For instance, the two leaves of Gwant can have the source labels S and O because they have incoming edges labeled ARG0 and ARG1.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"However, the Groschwitz algorithm is not deterministic: It allows object promotion (the sources for an ARG3 edge may be O3, O2, or O), unaccusative subjects (promoting the minimal object to S if the elementary graph contains an ARGi-edge (i > 0) but no ARG0-edge (Perlmutter, 1978)), and passive alternation (swapping O and S).",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"To make our as-graphs more consistent, we prefer constants that promote objects as far as possible, use unaccusative subjects, and no passive alternation, but still allow constants that do not satisfy these conditions if necessary.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"This increased our Smatch score significantly.
",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"Finally, we choose an arbitrary AM dependency
tree that combines the chosen elementary as-graphs into the annotated AMR; in practice, the differences between the trees seem to be negligible.2",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We can now model the AMR parsing task as the problem of computing the best well-typed AM dependency tree t for a given sentence w. Because t is well-typed, it can be decoded into an (indexed) AM term and thence evaluated to an as-graph.

"The projective decoder assumes that the AM dependency tree is projective, i.e. has no crossing dependency edges.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Because of this assumption, it can recursively combine adjacent substrings using dynamic programming.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"The algorithm is shown in Fig. 5 as a parsing schema (Shieber et al., 1995), which derives items of the form ([i, k], r, τ) with scores s. An item represents a well-typed derivation of the substring from i to k with head index r, and which evaluates to an as-graph of type τ .
",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"The parsing schema consists of three types of
rules.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"First, the Init rule generates an item for each graph fragment G[i] that the supertagger predicted for the token wi, along with the score and type of that graph fragment.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Second, given items for adjacent substrings [i, j] and [j, k], the Arc rules apply an operation f to combine the indexed AM terms for the two substrings, with Arc-R making the left-hand substring the head and the right-hand substring the argument or modifier, and Arc-L the other way around.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
We ensure that the result is well-typed by requiring that the types can be combined with f .,6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Finally, the Skip rules allow us to extend a substring such that it covers tokens which do not correspond to a graph fragment (i.e., their AM term is ⊥), introducing IGNORE edges.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"After all possible items have been derived, we extract the best well-typed tree from the item of the form ([1, n], r, τ) with the highest score, where τ =",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"[ ].
",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Because we keep track of the head indices, the projective decoder is a bilexical parsing algorithm, and shares a parsing complexity of O(n5) with other bilexical algorithms such as the Collins parser.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
It could be improved to a complexity of O(n4) using the algorithm of Eisner and Satta (1999).,6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]

"The Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm produces a forest of dependency trees, which we want to combine into tr.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"We choose the tree whose root r has the highest score for being the root of the AM dependency tree and make the roots of all others children of r.
At this point, the shape of tr is fixed.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"We choose
supertags for the nodes and edge labels for the edges by traversing tr bottom-up, computing types for the subtrees as we go along.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"Formally, we apply the parsing schema in Fig. 6.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"It uses items of the form (i, C, τ) : s, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n is a node of tr, C is the set of children of i for which we have already chosen edge labels, and τ is a type.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"We write Ch(i) for the set of children of i in tr.
",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"The Init rule generates an item for each graph that the supertagger can assign to each token i in w, ensuring that every token is also assigned ⊥ as a possible supertag.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"The Edge rule labels an edge from a parent node i in tr to one of its children k, whose children already have edge labels.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"As above, this rule ensures that a well-typed AM dependency tree is generated by locally checking the types.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"In particular, if all types τ2 that can be derived for k are incompatible with τ1, we fall back to an item for k with τ2 = ⊥ (which always exists), along with an IGNORE edge from i to k.

This paper addresses the task of AMR-totext generation by leveraging synchronous node replacement grammar. During training, graph-to-string rules are learned using a heuristic extraction algorithm. At test time, a graph transducer is applied to collapse input AMRs and generate output sentences. Evaluated on a standard benchmark, our method gives the state-of-the-art result.",text,[0],[0]
