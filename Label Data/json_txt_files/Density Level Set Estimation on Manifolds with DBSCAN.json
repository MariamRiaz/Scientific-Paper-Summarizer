{"sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996) is one of the most popular clustering algorithms amongst practitioners and has had profound success in a wide range of data analysis applications. However, despite this, its statistical properties have not been fully understood. The goal of this work is to give a theoretical analysis of the procedure and to the best of our knowledge, provide the first analysis of density levelset estimation on manifolds. We also contribute ideas to related areas that may be of independent interest.\nDBSCAN aims at discovering clusters which turn out to be the high-density regions of the dataset. It takes in two hyperparameters: minPts and \u03b5. It defines a point as a core-point if there are at least minPts sample points in its \u03b5radius neighborhood. The points within the \u03b5-radius neighborhood of a core-point are said to be directly reachable from that core-point. Then, a point q is reachable from a core-point p if there exists a path from q to p where each point is directly reachable from the next point. It is now clear that this definition of reachable gives a partitioning of\n1Google.

This partitioning is the clustering that is returned by DBSCAN.\nThe problem of analyzing DBSCAN has recently been explored in (Sriperumbudur & Steinwart, 2012). Their analysis is for a modified version of DBSCAN and is not focused on estimating a fixed density level. Their results have many desirable properties, but are not immediately applicable for what this paper tries to address. Using recent developments in topological data analysis along with some tools we develop in this paper, we show that it is now possible to analyze the original procedure.\nThe clusters DBSCAN aims at discovering can be viewed as approximations of the connected components of the level sets {x : f(x) \u2265 \u03bb} where f is the density and \u03bb is some density level. We provide the first comprehensive analysis in tuning minPts and \u03b5 to estimate the density level set for a particular level. Here, the density level \u03bb is known to the algorithm while the density remains unknown. Density level set estimation has been studied extensively. e.g., (Carmichael et al., 1968; Hartigan, 1975; Polonik, 1995; Cuevas & Fraiman, 1997; Walther, 1997; Tsybakov et al., 1997; Ba\u0131llo et al., 2001; Cadre, 2006; Willett & Nowak, 2007; Biau et al., 2008; Rigollet & Vert, 2009; Maier et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2009; Rinaldo & Wasserman, 2010; Steinwart, 2011; Rinaldo et al., 2012; Steinwart et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Jiang, 2017). However approaches that obtain state-of-art consistency results are largely unpractical (i.e. unimplementable). Our work shows that in actuality, DBSCAN, a procedure known for decades and has since been used widely, can achieve the strongest known results. Also, unlike much of the existing work, we show that DBSCAN can also recover the connected components of the level sets separately and bijectively.\nOur work begins with the insight that DBSCAN behaves like an \u03b5-neighborhood graph, which is different from, but related to the k-nearest neighbor graph. The latter has been heavily used for cluster-tree estimation (Chaudhuri & Dasgupta, 2010; Stuetzle & Nugent, 2010; Kpotufe & von Luxburg, 2011; Chaudhuri et al., 2014; Jiang & Kpotufe, 2017) and in this paper we adapt some of these ideas for \u03b5-neighborhood graphs.\nCluster-tree estimation aims at discovering the hierarchical tree structure of the connected-components as the levels vary. Balakrishnan et al. (2013) extends results by Chaudhuri & Dasgupta (2010) to the setting where the data lies on a lower dimensional manifold and provide consistency results depending on the lower dimension and independent of the ambient dimension. Here we are instead interested in how to set minPts and \u03b5 in order to estimate a particular level and provide rates on the Hausdorff distance error. This is different from works on cluster tree estimation which focuses on how to recover the tree structure rather than recovering a particular level. In that regard, we also require density estimation bounds in order to get a handle on the true density-levels and the empirical ones.\nDasgupta & Kpotufe (2014) gives us optimal highprobability finite-sample k-NN density estimation bounds which hold uniformly; this is key to obtaining optimal level-set estimation rates under the Hausdorff error. Much of the previous works on density level-set estimation, e.g. (Rigollet & Vert, 2009) provide rates under risk measures such as symmetric set difference. These metrics are considerably weaker than the Hausdorff metric; the latter is a uniform guarantee. There are such bounds for the histogram density estimator. This allowed Singh et al. (2009) to obtain optimal rates under Hausdorff metric, while having a fully adaptive procedure. This was a significant breakthrough for level set estimation, as discussed by Chazal et al. (2015). We believe this to be the strongest consistency results obtained thus far. However, a downside is that the histogram density estimator has little practical value. Here, aided with the desired bounds on the k-NN density estimator, we can actually obtain similar results to Singh et al. (2009) but with the clearly practical DBSCAN.\nWe extend the k-NN density estimation results of Dasgupta & Kpotufe (2014) to the manifold case, as the bulk our analysis is about the more general case that the data lies on a manifold. Density-based procedures perform poorly in high-dimensions since the number of samples required increases exponentially in the dimension\u2013 the so called curse of dimensionality. Thus, the consequences of handling the manifold case are of practical significance. Since the estimation rates we obtain depend only on the intrinsic dimension, it explains why DBSCAN can do well in high dimensions if the data has low intrinsic dimension (i.e. the manifold hypothesis). Given the modern capacity of systems to collect data of increasing complexity, it has become ever more important to understand the feasibility of practical algorithms in high dimensions.\nTo analyze DBSCAN, we write minPts and \u03b5 in terms of the d, unknown manfold dimension; k, which controls the density estimator; and \u03bb, which determines which level to estimate. We assume knowledge of \u03bb with the goal of es-\ntimating the \u03bb-level set of the density. We give a range of k in terms of n and corresponding consistency guarantees and estimation rates for such choices. We then adaptively tune d and k in order to attain close to optimal performance with no a priori knowledge of the distribution. Adaptivity is highly desirable because it allows for automatic tuning of the hyper-parameters, which is a core tenet of unsupervised learning. To solve for the unknown dimension, we use an estimator from Farahmand et al. (2007), which we show to have considerably better finite-sample behavior than previously thought. More details and discussion of related works is in the main text. We then provide a new method of choosing k such that it will asymptotically approach a value that provides near-optimal level set estimation rates."}, {"heading": "2. Overview", "text": "We start by analyzing the procedure under the manifold assumption. The end of the paper will discuss the fulldimensional setting. The bulk of our contribution lies in analyzing the former situation, while the analysis of the latter uses a subset of those techniques.\n\u2022 Section 3 proves that the clusters returned by DBSCAN are close to the connected components of certain \u03b5-neighborhood graphs (Lemma 2). This is significant because these graphs can be shown to estimate density level sets.\n\u2022 Section 4 introduces the manifold setting and provides supporting results including k-nearest neighbor density estimation bounds (Lemma 5 and Lemma 6) that are useful later on.\n\u2022 Section 5 provides a range of parameter settings under which for each true cluster, there exists a corresponding cluster returned by DBSCAN (Lemma 7 and Lemma 8), and a rate for the Hausdorff distance between them (Theorem 1).\n\u2022 Section 6 shows how one can apply DBSCAN a second time to remove false clusters from the first application, thus completing a bijection between the estimates and the true clusters (Theorem 2).\n\u2022 Section 7 explains how to adaptively tune the parameters so that they fall within the theoretical ranges. The main contributions of this section are a stronger result about a known k-nearest neighbor based approach to estimating the unknown dimension (Theorem 3) and a new way to tune k to approach an optimal choice of k (Theorem 4).\n\u2022 Section 8 gives the result when the data lives in RD without the manifold assumption."}, {"heading": "3. The connection to neighborhood graphs", "text": "This section is dedicated towards the understanding of the clusters produced by DBSCAN. The algorithm can be found in (Ester et al., 1996) and is not shown here since Lemma 1 characterizes what DBSCAN returns.\nWe have n i.i.d. samples X = {x1, ..., xn} drawn from a distribution F over RD. Definition 1. Define the k-NN radius of x \u2208 RD as\nrk(x) := inf{r > 0 : |X \u2229B(x, r)| \u2265 k},\nwhere B(x, r) denotes the Euclidean ball of radius r centered at x. Let G(k, \u03b5) denote the \u03b5-neighborhood level graph of X with vertices {x \u2208 X : rk(x) \u2264 \u03b5} and an edge between x and x\u2032 iff ||x\u2212 x\u2032|| \u2264 \u03b5. Remark 1. This is slightly different from \u03b5-neighborhood graph, which includes all vertices. Here we exclude vertices below certain empirical density level (i.e. rk(x) > \u03b5).\nThe next definition is relevant to DBSCAN and is from (Ester et al., 1996) but in the notation of Definition 1.\nDefinition 2. The following is with respect to fixed \u03b5 > 0 and minPts \u2208 N.\n\u2022 p is a core-point if rminPts(p) \u2264 \u03b5. \u2022 q is directly density-reachable from p if |p \u2212 q| \u2264 \u03b5\nand p is a core-point.\n\u2022 q is density-reachable from p if there exists a sequence q = p1, p2, ..., pm = p such that pi is directly densityreachable from pi+1 for i = 1, ..,m\u2212 1.\nThe following result is paraphrased from Lemmas 1 and 2 from (Ester et al., 1996), which characterizes the clusters learned by DBSCAN.\nLemma 1. (Ester et al., 1996) Let C be the clusters returned by DBSCAN(minPts, \u03b5). For any core-point x, there exists C \u2208 C with x \u2208 C. On the other hand, for any C \u2208 C, there exists core-point x such that C = {x\u2032 : x\u2032 is density-reachable from x}.\nWe now show the following result relating the \u03b5neighborhood level graphs and the clusters obtained from DBSCAN. Such an interpretation of DBSCAN has been given in previous works such as Campello et al. (2015).\nLemma 2 (DBSCAN and \u03b5-neighborhood level graphs). Let C be the clusters obtained from DBSCAN(minPts, \u03b5) on X . Let K be the connected components of G(minPts, \u03b5). Then, there exists a one-to-one correspence between C and K such that if C \u2208 C and K \u2208 K correspond, then\nK \u2286 C \u2286 \u222ax\u2208KB(x, \u03b5) \u2229X.\nProof. Take any K \u2208 K. Each point in K is a core-point and by Lemma 1 and the definition of density-reachable, each point in K belongs to the same C \u2208 C. Thus, K \u2286 {x \u2208 C : rk(x) \u2264 \u03b5}. Next we show that K = {x \u2208 C : rk(x) \u2264 \u03b5}.\nSuppose there exists core-point x \u2208 C but x /\u2208 K and let y \u2208 K. By Lemma 1, there exists core-point c \u2208 C such that all points in C are directly reachable from c. Then there exists a path of core-points from x to c with pairwise edges of length at most \u03b5. The same holds for c to y. Thus there exists such a path of core-points from x to y, which means that x, y are in the same CC of G(minPts, \u03b5), contradicting the assumption that x /\u2208 K and y \u2208 K. Thus, in fact K = {x \u2208 C : rk(x) \u2264 \u03b5}. The result now follows since C consists of points that are at most \u03b5 from its core-points.\nWe can now see that DBSCAN\u2019s clusterings can be viewed as the connected components (CCs) of an appropriate - neighborhood level graph. Using a neighborhood graph to approximate the level-set has been studied in (Rinaldo & Wasserman, 2010). The difference is that they use a kernel density estimator instead of a k-NN density estimator and study the convergence properties under different settings."}, {"heading": "4.

If \u03b4 = 1/n, then C\u03b4,n = O((log n)3/2).\nNext, we need the following bound on the volume of the intersection Euclidean ball and M ; this is required to get a handle on the true mass of the ball under F in later arguments. The upper and lower bounds follow from Chazal (2013) and Lemma 5.3 of Niyogi et al. (2008). The proof is given in the appendix.\nLemma 4 (Ball Volume).

We can choose any 0 < \u03b2 < \u221e. The \u03b2regularity assumption appears in e.g. (Singh et al., 2009). This is very general and also allows us to make a separate global smoothness assumption.\nRemark 6. We currently characterize the smoothness w.r.t. the Euclidean distance. One could alternatively use the geodesic distance on M , dM (p, q). It follows from Proposition 6.3 of Niyogi et al.

Define r0 = r\u0304/2. We have\nr0 = 1\n2 ( 4 \u00b7 C2\u03b4,n C\u030c\u03b2 \u00b7 \u221a k )1/\u03b2 \u2265 ( k vdn\u03bb0 )1/d \u2265 \u03b5,\nwhere the first inequality holds when Ku is chosen sufficiently small, and the last inequality holds because \u03bb0 < \u03bb \u2212 C 2 \u03b4,n\u221a k \u03bb. Hence r0 + \u03b5 \u2264 r\u0304. Therefore, it suffices to show\nsup x\u2208(XC\\C\u2295r0 )\u2229X fk(x) < \u03bb\u2212 C2\u03b4,n\u221a k \u03bb.\nWe have that for x \u2208 (XC\\C\u2295r0/2) \u2229 X , f(x) \u2264 \u03bb \u2212 C\u030c\u03b2(r0/2)\n\u03b2 := \u03bb\u2032. Thus, for any x \u2208 (XC\\C\u2295r0) \u2229X and letting = \u03bb\u2032 \u2212 f(x), we have\nr\u0302( , x) \u2265 r0/2 \u2265 (4\u03bb0C\u03b4,n/( \u221a k \u00b7 C\u030c\u03b2))1/\u03b2/2.\nFor Ku chosen sufficiently small, the last equation will be large enough (i.e. of order (k/vdn\u03bb)1/d) so that the conditions of Lemma 5 hold. Thus, applying this for each x \u2208 (XC\\C\u2295r0) \u2229X , we obtain\nsup x\u2208(XC\\C\u2295r0 )\u2229X fk(x) <\n( 1 + 3\nC\u03b4,n\u221a k\n) (\u03bb\u2212 C\u030c\u03b2(r0/2)\u03b2).\nWe have the r.h.s. is at most \u03bb \u2212 C 2 \u03b4,n\u221a k \u03bb for Ku chosen appropriately and the first direction follows.\nWe now turn to the other direction, that supx\u2208C d(x, C\u0302) \u2264 r\u0304. Let x \u2208 C. Then there exists sample point x\u2032 \u2208 B(x, rn(C)) by definition of rn and we have that x\u2032 \u2208 C\u0302.

When taking k \u2248 n2\u03b2\u2032/(2\u03b2\u2032+d), we obtain the error rate of dHaus(C, C\u0302) \u2248 n\u22121/(2\u03b2+d\u00b7max{1,\u03b2}), ignoring logarithmic factors. When 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 1, this matches the known lower bound established in Theorem 4 of Tsybakov et al. (1997). However, we do not obtain this rate when \u03b2 > 1. In this case, the density estimation error will be of order at least n\u22121/(2+d) due in part to the error from resolving the geodesic balls with Euclidean balls.

Thus it remains an open problem whether the manifold level-set rates are minimax optimal when \u03b2 > 1."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The author is grateful to Samory Kpotufe for insightful discussions and to the anonymous reviewers for their useful feedback."}], "year": 2017, "references": [{"title": "Convergence rates in nonparametric estimation of level", "authors": ["Ba\u0131llo", "Amparo", "Cuesta-Albertos", "Juan A", "Cuevas", "Antonio"], "venue": "sets.
