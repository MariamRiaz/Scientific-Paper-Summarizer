Scientific Paper Summarizer

To convert the papers from pdf to json file used the latest science-parse-cli-assembly (https://github.com/allenai/science-parse/releases) executable from the releases. Then to start the localhost server the following command is used;

java -jar science-parse-cli-assembly-2.0.3.jar

This starts a server which is hosted locally at the address “http://localhost:8080/v1”.

The size of the model is big, so it can't be uploaded on github. But it can be accessed via this link;
