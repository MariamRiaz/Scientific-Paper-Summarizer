1	47	Different from open information extraction (Open IE) (Banko et al., 2007) whose relation words are extracted from the given sentence, in this task, relation words are extracted from a predefined relation set which may not appear in the given sentence.
2	26	It is an important issue in knowledge extraction and automatic construction of knowledge base.
3	10	Traditional methods handle this task in a pipelined manner, i.e., extracting the entities (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007) first and then recognizing their relations (Rink, 2010).
4	17	This separated framework makes the task easy to deal with, and each component can be more flexible.
20	17	We design a kind of novel tags which contain the information of entities and the relationships they hold.
59	15	The relation type information is obtained from a predefined set of relations and the relation role information is represented by the numbers “1” and “2”.
67	21	For example, the word of “United” is the first word of entity “United States” and is related to the relation “Country-President”, so its tag is “B-CP-1”.

96	17	We also adopt a LSTM structure to produce the tag sequence.
105	12	The larger α is, the greater influence of relational tags on the model.
113	12	In other words, we did not use the label of entity types to train the model, therefore we do not need to consider the entity types in the evaluation.
114	11	A triplet is regarded as correct when its relation type and the head offsets of two corresponding entities are both correct.
124	16	Baselines We compare our method with several classical triplet extraction methods, which can be divided into the following categories: the pipelined methods, the jointly extracting methods and the end-to-end methods based our tagging scheme.
151	19	In order to find out the factors that affect the results of end-to-end models, we analyze the performance on predicting each element in the triplet as Table 2 shows.
157	19	It means that some of the predicted entities do not form a pair.
160	29	Therefore, entity pair (E1, E2) has higher precision and lower recall than single E. Besides, the predicted results of (E1, E2) in Table 2 have about 3% improvement when compared predicted results in Table 1, which means that 3% of the test data is predicted to be wrong because the relation type is predicted to be wrong.
163	12	The single entities refer to those who cannot find their corresponding entities.
164	11	Figure 4 shows whether it is E1 or E2, our method can get a relatively low ratio on the single entities.
165	28	It means that our method can effectively associate two entities when compared LSTM-CRF and LSTM-LSTM which pay little attention to the relational tags.
167	11	If α is too large, it will affect the accuracy of prediction and if α is too small, the recall will decline.
170	24	Each example contains three row, the first row is the gold standard, the second and the third rows are the extracted results of model LSTM-LSTM and LSTM-LSTM-Bias respectively.
171	21	S1 represents the situation that the distance between the two interrelated entities is far away from each other, which is more difficult to detect their relationships.
176	15	Besides, the patten “a * of *” between Germany and MiddleAges may be easy to mislead the models that there exists a relation of “Contains” between them.
177	69	The problem can be solved by adding some samples of this kind of expression patterns to the training data.
178	16	S3 is a case that models can predict the entities’ head offset right, but the relational role is wrong.
179	11	LSTM-LSTM treats both “Stephen A. Schwarzman” and “Blackstone Group” as entity E1, and can not find its corresponding E2.
182	18	In this paper, we propose a novel tagging scheme and investigate the end-to-end models to jointly extract entities and relations.
184	12	But it still has shortcoming on the identification of the overlapping relations.
186	36	In this way, a word can appear in multiple triplet results, which can solve the problem of overlapping relations.
187	37	Although, our model can enhance the effect of entity tags, the association between two corresponding entities still requires refinement in next works.
