0	34	The basic idea of distributional semantics, i.e. determining the meaning of a word based on its co-occurrence with other words, is derived from the empiricists – Harris (1954) and Firth (1957).
6	12	The idea of semantic composition is not new.
7	15	It is well known as the principle of compositionality:2 “The meaning of a compound expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and of the way they are syntactically combined.” (Janssen, 2012, p. 19).
8	28	Modelling the meaning of textual units larger than words using compositional and distributional information is the main subject of compositional distributional semantics (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Socher et al., 2012, to name a few studies).
12	15	The SICK corpus (Bentivogli et al., 2014) consists of 10K pairs of English sentences containing multiple lexical, syntactic, and semantic phenomena.
15	42	The relatedness score corresponds to the degree of semantic relatedness between two sentences and is calculated as the average of ten human ratings collected for this sentence pair on the 5-point Likert scale.
18	13	According to the SICK guidelines, the label assigned by the majority of human annotators is selected as the valid entailment label.
19	14	Studying approaches to various natural language processing (henceforth NLP) problems, we have observed that the availability of language resources (e.g. training or testing data) stimulates the development of NLP tools and the estimation of NLP models.
21	22	Therefore, NLP methods are mostly designed for English and tested on English data, even if there is no guarantee that they are universal.
31	33	The procedure of building an evaluation dataset for validating compositional distributional semantics models of Polish generally builds on steps designed to assemble the SICK corpus (described in Section 1.3) because we aim at building an evaluation dataset which is comparable to the SICK corpus.
45	16	The authors are instructed to write one single sentence (with a sentence predicate) describing the action in a displayed image.
52	14	The expansion step, in turn, is implemented and the sentences provided by the authors are lexically and syntactically transformed in order to obtain derivative sentences with similar, contrastive, or neutral meanings.
71	12	6. negation, e.g. Mężczyźni w turbanach na głowach siedzą na słoniach.
88	26	For each of the 1K images, the following 10 pairs are constructed (for A being the set of all sentences originally written by the first author, B being the set of all sentences originally written by the second author, a ∈ A and b ∈ B being the original descriptions of the picture): 1.
89	12	(a,a1), where a1 ∈ t(a), and t(a) is the set of all transformations of the sentence a 3.
95	38	The degree of semantic relatedness between two sentences is calculated as the average of all human ratings on the Likert scale with the range from 0 to 5.
105	14	• 0 (unrelated): Kot siedzi na płocie.
109	13	Polish entailment labels correspond directly to the SICK labels (i.e. entailment, contradiction, neutral).
115	23	In order to avoid annotating erroneous sentences, the annotation process is divided into two stages: 1. a sentence pair is sent to a judge with the leader role, who is expected to edit and to correct the transformed sentence from this pair before annotation, if necessary, 2. the verified and possibly enhanced sentence pair is sent to the other two judges, who can only annotate it.
133	57	Since each sentence pair is annotated for entailment in both directions, the final entailment label is actually a pair of two labels: • entailment+neutral points to ‘one-way’ entailment, • contradiction+neutral points to ‘one-way’ contradiction, • entailment+entailment, contradiction+contradiction, and neutral+neutral point to equivalence.
143	16	Measured with Fleiss’ kappa, there is an inter-annotator agreement of κ = 0.734 for entailment labels in Polish evaluation dataset, which is quite satisfactory as for a semantic labelling task.
153	51	Measured with Krippendorff’s ordinal α, there is an inter-annotator agreement of α = 0.780 for relatedness scores in the Polish evaluation dataset, which is quite satisfactory as well.
155	20	The goal of this paper is to present the procedure of building a Polish evaluation dataset for the validation of compositional distributional semantics models.
157	14	However, the procedure of building the SICK corpus cannot be adapted without modifications.
158	28	First, the Polish seed-sentences have to be written based on the images which are selected from 8K ImageFlickr dataset and split into thematic groups, since usable datasets are not publicly available.
162	15	Since an entailment relation between two sentences must not be symmetric, each sentence pair is annotated for entailment in both directions.
163	22	Furthermore, we introduce an element of human verification of correctness of automatically transformed sentences and some additional post-corrections.
164	24	The presented procedure of building a dataset was tested on Polish.
165	103	However, it is very likely that the annotation framework will work for other Slavic languages (e.g. Czech with an excellent dependency parser).
166	20	The presented procedure results in building the Polish test corpus of relatively high quality, confirmed by the inter-annotator agreement coefficients of κ = 0.734 (measured with Fleiss’ kappa) for entailment labels and of α = 0.780 (measured with Krippendorff’s ordinal alpha) for relatedness scores.
