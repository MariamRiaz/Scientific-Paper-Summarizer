3	52	Among the main classes of cues put forward, prosodic cues (e.g. stress, prosodic boundaries) have been shown to be particularly useful in early-stage word segmentation (Christophe et al., 2003; Curtin et al., 2005; Seidl and Johnson, 2006).
4	16	Previous work suggests that these cues may be emphasized in the speech register often used when addressing infants (infantdirected speech; IDS).
5	51	This register is characterized by shorter utterances, repeated words and exaggerated prosody (see (Cristia, 2013) for a review).
6	36	It has been shown that IDS can facilitate segmentation performance in infants (Thiessen et al., 2005), when compared to the register that parents use when talking to adults (adult-directed speech; ADS).
7	41	The process of word segmentation has received considerable attention also from the computational linguistics community, where various computational models have been proposed (e.g. (Brent and Cartwright, 1996; Goldwater et al., 2009)).
8	24	Yet, despite the role that prosodic cues play in early word segmentation, only lexical stress has been addressed in detail, in the computational modelling literature (e.g. (BoÌˆrschinger and Johnson, 2014; Doyle and Levy, 2013; Lignos, 2011)).
10	13	That study found that that an Adaptor Grammar model (Johnson et al., 2007) performed better on both English and Japanese corpora when prosodic boundary information was added to its grammar.
15	9	We aim to put together these two lines of research, by conducting the first computational study of word segmentation that takes into account both variables: speech register and prosodic boundary information.
17	15	More importantly, it is performed in a more controlled manner as it makes use of a large corpus of spontaneous verbal interactions, containing both IDS and ADS uttered by the same speakers.
18	19	Furthermore, we do not limit ourselves to a specific model, but test several, different, unsupervised segmentation models in order to increase the generalizability of the findings.
20	42	We selected 2 sub-lexical and 2 lexical models, all of which are made freely available through the CDSwordSeg package1.
26	22	Diphone-based segmentation (DiBS) is another sub-lexical model, which uses diphones instead of syllables pairs (Daland and Pierrehumbert, 2011).
41	11	The RIKEN corpus (Mazuka et al., 2006) contains recordings of 22 Japanese mothers interacting with their 18 to 24-month old infants, while playing with toys or reading a book.
51	23	It contains academic speech and was previously used to investigate either the effect of speech register (Fourtassi et al., 2013) or that of prosodic boundaries (Ludusan et al., 2015) on unsupervised word segmentation.
55	19	PUDDLE, being an incremental algorithm, was evaluated using a five-fold cross-validation.
59	15	For the base case, the system had in input a file containing on each line an utterance, defined as being an intonational phrase or a filler phrase followed by a pause longer than 200 ms.
60	12	In the brk3 and brk23 cases, each prosodic phrase was considered as a standalone utterance, and thus was written on a separate line.
65	20	As there was no significant difference between the results with the two balanced subsets and the entire IDS corpus, we will present here only the latter results.
72	22	DiBS gives the lowest performance (.132 token Fscore for CSJ base), followed by TP, PUDDLE and AG giving the best performance (.567 token F-score for ADS brk23).
78	17	Interestingly, we also found that the size and direction of this difference was dependent on the algorithm used.
81	10	The performance of sub-lexical models improves more with the use of prosodic information than that of lexical models, and this for all corpora.
85	25	Overall, the improvement brought by prosodic boundaries is smaller.
94	13	The unexpected value obtained for IDS might be due to the high number of long onomatopoeia present in the corpus.
95	27	Thus, any IDS advantage due to having shorter utterances might be reversed by having longer words.
96	38	We computed also the average number of types per token, which can give information about the distribution of the words in the corpora.
103	15	This may explain why, when prosody equates sentence lengths, the advantage of IDS over ADS becomes small or even reverts to a detrimental effect.
107	11	However, the impact of prosody was unequal and showed an interaction with register: It helped more ADS than IDS to the point that, with prosody taken into account, spontaneous ADS and IDS yield somewhat similar scores.
109	30	If our observations are true, as far as word segmentation goes, it is not the case that IDS is massively easier to segment than ADS, at least at the stage when infants have acquired the ability to use prosodic breaks to constrain word segmentation.
110	28	Of course, our observations would need to be confirmed and replicated with other languages and recording procedures.
111	32	To conclude, our study illustrates the interest of testing theories of language acquisition using quantitative tools.
