Two important challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) are the problems of representation learning and of automatic discovery of skills.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Proto-value functions (PVFs) are a well-known solution for the problem of representation learning (Mahadevan, 2005; Mahadevan & Maggioni, 2007); while the problem of skill discovery is generally posed under the options framework (Sutton et al., 1999; Precup, 2000), which models skills as options.

"In this paper, we tie together representation learning and option discovery by showing how PVFs implicitly define options.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
One of our main contributions is to introduce the concepts of eigenpurpose and eigenbehavior.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Eigenpurposes are intrinsic reward functions that incentivize the agent to traverse the state space by following the principal directions of the learned representation.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

the optimal policy for that reward function.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
In this paper we introduce an algorithm for option discovery that leverages these ideas.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The options we discover are task-independent because, as PVFs, the eigenpurposes are obtained without any information about the environment’s reward structure.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We first present these ideas in the tabular case and then show how they can be generalized to the function approximation case.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Exploration, while traditionally a separate problem from option discovery, can also be addressed through the careful construction of options (McGovern & Barto, 2001; Şimşek et al., 2005; Solway et al., 2014; Kulkarni et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we provide evidence that not all options capable of accelerating planning are useful for exploration.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We show that options traditionally used in the literature to speed up planning hinder the agents’ performance if used for random exploration during learning.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our options have two important properties that allow them to improve exploration: (i) they operate at different time scales, and (ii) they can be easily sequenced.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Having options that operate at different time scales allows agents to make finely timed actions while also decreasing the likelihood the agent will explore only a small portion of the state space.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, because our options are defined across the whole state space, multiple options are available in every state, which allows them to be easily sequenced.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We generally indicate random variables by capital letters (e.g., R
t ), vectors by bold letters (e.g., ✓), functions by lowercase letters (e.g., v), and sets by calligraphic font (e.g., S).",2. Background,[0],[0]
"In the RL framework (Sutton & Barto, 1998), an agent aims to maximize cumulative reward by taking actions in an environment.",2.1. Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
These actions affect the agent’s next state and the rewards it experiences.,2.1. Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
We use the MDP formalism throughout this paper.,2.1. Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"An MDP is a 5-tuple hS,A, r, p, i.",2.1. Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]
"At time t the agent is in state s

Sometimes it is not feasible to learn a value for each stateaction pair due to the size of the state space.,2.1. Reinforcement Learning,[0],[0]

The options framework extends RL by introducing temporally extended actions called skills or options.,2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]
An option ! is a 3-tuple !,2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]

After the agent decides to follow option !,2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]
"from a state in I, actions are selected according to ⇡ until the agent reaches a state in T .",2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, options are higher-level actions that extend over several time steps, generalizing MDPs to semiMarkov decision processes (SMDPs) (Puterman, 1994).
",2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]
"Traditionally, options capable of moving agents to bottleneck states are sought after.",2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]
"Bottleneck states are those states that connect different densely connected regions of the state space (e.g., doorways) (Şimşek & Barto, 2004; Solway et al., 2014).",2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]
"They have been shown to be very efficient for planning as these states are the states most frequently visited when considering the shortest distance between any two states in an MDP (Solway et al., 2014).",2.2. The Options Framework,[0],[0]
"Proto-value functions (PVFs) are learned representations that capture large-scale temporal properties of an environment (Mahadevan, 2005; Mahadevan & Maggioni, 2007).",2.3. Proto-Value Functions,[0],[0]
"They are obtained by diagonalizing a diffusion model, which is constructed from the MDP’s transition matrix.",2.3. Proto-Value Functions,[0],[0]
"A diffusion model captures information flow on a graph, and
it is commonly defined by the combinatorial graph Laplacian matrix L = D A, where A is the graph’s adjacency matrix and D the diagonal matrix whose entries are the row sums of A. Notice that the adjacency matrix A easily generalizes to a weight matrix W .",2.3. Proto-Value Functions,[0],[0]
"PVFs are defined to be the eigenvectors obtained after the eigendecomposition of L. Different diffusion models can be used to generate PVFs, such as the normalized graph Laplacian L = D 12 (D A)D 12 , which we use in this paper.",2.3. Proto-Value Functions,[0],[0]
"PVFs capture the large-scale geometry of the environment, such as symmetries and bottlenecks.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"They are task independent, in the sense that they do not use information related to reward functions.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Moreover, they are defined over the whole state space since each eigenvector induces a realvalued mapping over each state.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
We can imagine that options with these properties should also be useful.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"In this section we show how to use PVFs to discover options.
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
Let us start with an example.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
Consider the traditional 4- room domain depicted in Figure 1c.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
Gray squares represent walls and white squares represent accessible states.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Four actions are available: up, down, right, and left.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
The transitions are deterministic and the agent is not allowed to move into a wall.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Ideally, we would like to discover options that move the agent from room to room.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Thus, we should be able to automatically distinguish between the different rooms in the environment.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"This is exactly what PVFs do, as depicted in Figure 2 (left).",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Instead of interpreting a PVF as a basis function, we can interpret the PVF in our example as a desire to reach the highest point of the plot, corresponding to the centre of the room.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Because the sign of an eigenvector is arbitrary, a PVF can also be interpreted as a desire to reach the lowest point of the plot, corresponding to the opposite room.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"In this paper we use the eigenvectors in both directions (i.e., both signs).
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
An eigenpurpose formalizes the interpretation above by defining an intrinsic reward function.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We can see it as defining a purpose for the agent, that is, to maximize the discounted sum of these rewards.
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
Definition 3.1 (Eigenpurpose).,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"An eigenpurpose is the intrinsic reward function re
i
(s, s 0 ) of a proto-value function
e 2 R|S| such that
r e i (s, s 0 )",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"= e > ( (s0) (s)), (1)
where (x) denotes the feature representation of state x.
Notice that an eigenpurpose, in the tabular case, can be written as re
i
(s, s 0 )",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"= e[s 0 ] e[s].
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We can now define a new MDP to learn the option associated with the purpose, Me
i = hS,A[{?}, re i , p, i, where
the reward function is defined as in (1) and the action set is augmented by the action terminate (?), which allows the agent to leave Me
i without any cost.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
The state space and the transition probability kernel remain unchanged from the original problem.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"The discount rate can be chosen arbitrarily, although it impacts the timescale the option encodes.
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"With Me i we define a new state-value function ve ⇡ (s), for policy ⇡, as the expected value of the cumulative discounted intrinsic reward if the agent starts in state s and follows policy ⇡ until termination.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Similarly, we define a new action-value function qe
⇡ (s, a) as the expected value of the cumulative discounted intrinsic reward if the agent starts in state s, takes action a, and then follows policy ⇡ until termination.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We can also describe the optimal value function for any eigenpurpose obtained through e:
v e ⇤(s) = max
⇡
v e ⇡ (s) and qe⇤(s, a) = max ⇡ q e ⇡ (s, a).
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"These definitions naturally lead us to eigenbehaviors.
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
Definition 3.2 (Eigenbehavior).,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
An eigenbehavior is a policy e : S !,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"A that is optimal with respect to the eigenpurpose re
i
, i.e., e(s) = argmax a2A",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"q e ⇤(s, a).
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Finding the optimal policy ⇡e⇤ now becomes a traditional RL problem, with a different reward function.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Importantly, this reward function tends to be dense, avoiding challenging situations due to exploration issues.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"In this paper we use policy iteration to solve for an optimal policy.
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"If each eigenpurpose defines an option, its corresponding eigenbehavior is the option’s policy.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Thus, we need to define the option’s initiation and termination set.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"An option should be available in every state where it is possible to achieve its purpose, and to terminate when it is achieved.
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"When defining the MDP to learn the option, we augmented the agent’s action set with the terminate action, allowing the agent to interrupt the option anytime.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We want options to terminate when the agent achieves its purpose, i.e., when it is unable to accumulate further positive intrinsic rewards.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"With the defined reward function, this happens when the agent reaches the state with largest value in the eigenpurpose (or a local maximum when < 1).",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
Any subsequent reward will be negative.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We are able to formalize this con-
dition by defining q",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]

"An option following a policy e terminates when qe
(s, a)  0 for all a 2 A.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We define the initiation set to be all states in which there exists an action a 2 A such that qe
(s, a) > 0.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]

We refer to the options discovered with our approach as eigenoptions.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"The eigenoption corresponding to the example at the beginning of this section is depicted in Figure 2 (right).
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"For any eigenoption, there is always at least one state in which it terminates, as we now show.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]

Proof.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We can write the Bellman equation in the matrix form: v = r+ Tv, where v is a finite column vector with one entry per state encoding its value function.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"From (1) we have r = Tw w with w = (s)>e, where e denotes the eigenpurpose of interest.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Therefore:
v +w = Tw + Tv
= (1 )Tw + T (v +w) = (1 )(I T ) 1Tw.

"T ) 1T ||1||w||1
||v +w||1  (1 ) 1 (1 ) ||w||1
||v +w||1  ||w||1
We can shift w by any finite constant without changing the reward, i.e., Tw w = T (w+ ) (w+ )",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"because T1 = 1 since P j T i,j
= 1.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Hence, we can assume w 0.",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"Let s ⇤ = argmax

ws⇤ | = vs⇤ +,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"ws⇤ > w
s ⇤ = ||w||1, arriving at a contradiction.
",3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
This result is applicable in both the tabular and linear function approximation case.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
An algorithm that does not rely on knowing the underlying graph is provided in Section 5.,3. Option Discovery through the Laplacian,[0],[0]
"We used three MDPs in our empirical study (c.f. Figure 1): an open room, an I-Maze, and the 4-room domain.",4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
Their transitions are deterministic and gray squares denote walls.,4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Agents have access to four actions: up, down, right, and left.",4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When an action that would have taken the agent into a wall is chosen, the agent’s state does not change.",4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We demonstrate three aspects of our framework:1
• How the eigenoptions present specific purposes.",4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, options leading to bottlenecks are not the first ones we discover.
",4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
"• How eigenoptions improve exploration by reducing the expected number of steps required to navigate between any two states.
",4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
• How eigenoptions help agents to accumulate reward faster.,4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
We show how few options may hurt the agents’ performance while enough options speed up learning.,4. Empirical Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In the PVF theory, the “smoothest” eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues, are preferred (Mahadevan & Maggioni, 2007).",4.1. Discovered Options,[0],[0]
"The same intuition applies to eigenoptions, with the eigenpurposes corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues being preferred.",4.1. Discovered Options,[0],[0]
"Figures 3, 4, and 5 depict the first eigenoptions discovered in the three domains used for evaluation.
",4.1. Discovered Options,[0],[0]
"Eigenoptions do not necessarily look for bottleneck states, 1Python code can be found at: https://github.com/mcmachado/options
allowing us to apply our algorithm in many environments in which there are no obvious, or meaningful, bottlenecks.",4.1. Discovered Options,[0],[0]
"We discover meaningful options in these environments, such as walking down a corridor, or going to the corners of an open room.",4.1. Discovered Options,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, doorways are not the first options we discover in the 4-room domain (the fifth eigenoption is the first to terminate at the entrance of a doorway).",4.1. Discovered Options,[0],[0]
"In the next sections we provide empirical evidence that eigenoptions are useful, and often more so than bottleneck options.",4.1. Discovered Options,[0],[0]
"A major challenge for agents to explore an environment is to be decisive, avoiding the dithering commonly observed in random walks (Machado & Bowling, 2016; Osband et al., 2016).",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
Options provide such decisiveness by operating in a higher level of abstraction.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"Agents performing a random walk, when equipped with options, are expected to cover larger distances in the state space, navigating back and forth between subgoals instead of dithering around the starting state.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"However, options need to satisfy two conditions to improve exploration: (1) they have to be available in several parts of the state space, ensuring the agent always has access to many different options; and (2) they have to operate at different time scales.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"For instance, in the 4-room domain, it is unlikely an agent randomly selects enough primitive actions leading it to a corner if all options move the agent between doorways.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"An important result in this section is to show that it is very unlikely for an agent to explore the whole environment if it keeps going back and forth between similar high-level goals.
",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
Eigenoptions satisfy both conditions.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"As demonstrated in Section 4.1, eigenoptions are often defined in the whole state space, allowing sequencing.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"Moreover, PVFs can be seen as a “frequency” basis, with different PVFs being associated with different frequencies (Mahadevan & Maggioni, 2007).",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"The corresponding eigenoptions also operate
at different frequencies, with the length of a trajectory until termination varying.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
This behavior can be seen when comparing the second and fourth eigenoptions in the 10 ⇥ 10 grid (Figure 3).,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"The fourth eigenoption terminates, on expectation, twice as often as the second eigenoption.
",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
In this section we show that eigenoptions improve exploration.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"We do so by introducing a new metric, which we call diffusion time.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
Diffusion time encodes the expected number of steps required to navigate between two states randomly chosen in the MDP while following a random walk.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
A small expected number of steps implies that it is more likely that the agent will reach all states with a random walk.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"We discuss how this metric can be computed in the Appendix.
Figure 6 depicts, for our the three environments, the diffusion time with options and the diffusion time using only primitive actions.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"We add options incrementally in order of increasing eigenvalue when computing the diffusion time for different sets of options.
",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"The first options added hurt exploration, but when enough options are added, exploration is greatly improved when compared to a random walk using only primitive actions.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"The fact that few options hurt exploration may be surprising at first, based on the fact that few useful options are generally sought after in the literature.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"However, this is a major difference between using options for planning and for learning.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"In planning, options shortcut the agents’ trajectories, pruning the search space.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
All other actions are still taken into consideration.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"When exploring, a uniformly random policy over options and primitive actions skews where
agents spend their time.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"Options that are much longer than primitive actions reduce the likelihood that an agent will deviate much from the options’ trajectories, since sampling an option may undo dozens of primitive actions.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"This biasing is often observed when fewer options are available.
",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
The discussion above can be made clearer with an example.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"In the 4-room domain, if the only options available are those leading the agent to doorways (c.f. Appendix), it is less likely the agent will reach the outer corners.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
To do so the agent would have to select enough consecutive primitive actions without sampling an option.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"Also, it is very likely agents will be always moving between rooms, never really exploring inside a room.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
These issues are mitigated with eigenoptions.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"The first eigenoptions lead agents to individual rooms, but other eigenoptions operate in different time scales, allowing agents to explore different parts of rooms.
",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"Figure 6d supports the intuition that options leading to bottleneck states are not sufficient, by themselves, for exploration.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
It shows how the diffusion time in the 4-room domain is increased when only bottleneck options are used.,4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
"As in the PVF literature, the ideal number of options to be used by an agent can be seen as a model selection problem.",4.2. Exploration,[0],[0]
We now illustrate the usefulness of our options when the agent’s goal is to accumulate reward.,4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
We also study the impact of an increasing number of options in such a task.,4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"In these experiments, the agent starts at the bottom left cor-
ner and its goal is to reach the top right corner.",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"The agent observes a reward of 0 until the goal is reached, when it observes a reward of +1.",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"We used Q-Learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992) (↵ = 0.1, = 0.9) to learn a policy over primitive actions.",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"The behavior policy chooses uniformly over primitive actions and options, following them until termination.",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"Figure 7 depicts, after learning for a given number of episodes, the average over 100 trials of the agents’ final performance.",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"Episodes were 100 time steps long, and we learned for 250 episodes in the 10 ⇥ 10 grid and in the I-Maze, and for 500 episodes in the 4-room domain.
",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
In most scenarios eigenoptions improve performance.,4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"As in the previous section, exceptions occur when only a few options are added to the agent’s action set.",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
The best results were obtained using 64 options.,4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"Despite being an additional parameter, our results show that the agent’s performance is fairly robust across different numbers of options.
",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
Eigenoptions are task-independent by construction.,4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
Additional results in the appendix show how the same set of eigenoptions is able to speed-up learning in different tasks.,4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
"In the appendix we also compare eigenoptions to random options, that is, options that use a random state as subgoal.",4.3. Accumulating Rewards,[0],[0]
So far we have assumed that agents have access to the adjacency matrix representing the underlying MDP.,5. Approximate Option Discovery,[0],[0]
"However, in practical settings this is generally not true.",5. Approximate Option Discovery,[0],[0]
"In fact, the number of states in these settings is often so large that agents rarely visit the same state twice.",5. Approximate Option Discovery,[0],[0]
"These problems are generally tackled with sample-based methods and some sort of function approximation.
",5. Approximate Option Discovery,[0],[0]
In this section we propose a sample-based approach for option discovery that asymptotically discovers eigenoptions.,5. Approximate Option Discovery,[0],[0]
We then extend this algorithm to linear function approximation.,5. Approximate Option Discovery,[0],[0]
We provide anecdotal evidence in Atari 2600 games that this relatively naı̈ve sample-based approach to function approximation discovers purposeful options.,5. Approximate Option Discovery,[0],[0]
"In the online setting, agents must sample trajectories.",5.1. Sample-based Option Discovery,[0],[0]
"Naturally, one can sample trajectories until one is able to perfectly construct the MDP’s adjacency matrix, as suggested by Mahadevan & Maggioni (2007).",5.1. Sample-based Option Discovery,[0],[0]
"However, this approach does not easily extend to linear function approximation.",5.1. Sample-based Option Discovery,[0],[0]
"In this section we provide an approach that does not build the adjacency matrix allowing us to extend the concept of eigenpurposes to linear function approximation.

"If informative rewards are unlikely to be found by an agent using only primitive actions, requiring long or specific sequences of actions, options are equally unlikely to be discovered.

"Options discovered this way tend to be independent of an agent’s intention, and are potentially useful in many different tasks (Gregor et al., 2016).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Such options can also be seen as being useful for exploration by allowing agents to commit to a behavior for an extended period of time (Machado & Bowling, 2016).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]

The idea of discovering options by learning to control parts of the environment is also related to our work.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Eigenpurposes encode different rates of change in the agents representation of the world, while the corresponding options aim at maximizing such change.",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
Others have also proposed ways to discover options based on the idea of learning to control the environment.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Hengst (2002), for instance, proposes an algorithm that explicitly models changes in the variables that form the agent’s representation.",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recently, Gregor et al. (2016) proposed an algorithm in which agents discover options by maximizing a notion of empowerment (Salge et al., 2014), where the agent aims at getting to states with a maximal set of available intrinsic options.

"Continual Curiosity driven Skill Acquisition (CCSA) (Kompella et al., In Press) is the closest approach to ours.",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
CCSA also discovers skills that maximize an intrinsic reward obtained by some extracted representation.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]

"Interestingly, the options first discovered by our approach do not necessarily find bottlenecks, which are commonly sought after.",7. Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In this paper we showed how bottleneck options can hinder exploration strategies if naively added to the agent’s action set, and how the options we discover can help an agent to explore.",7. Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Also, we have shown how the discovered options can be used to accumulate reward in a multitude of tasks, leveraging their exploratory properties.

There are several exciting avenues for future work.,7. Conclusion,[0],[0]

It would be interesting to compare such an approach to eigenoptions.,7. Conclusion,[0],[0]
It would also be interesting to see if the options we discover can be generated incrementally and with incomplete graphs.,7. Conclusion,[0],[0]

"This choice allows us to focus on existing models for sentence embedding, and it allows us to evaluate the ability of those models to learn useful representations of meaning (which may be independently useful for subsequent tasks), at the cost of excluding from con-

"Of the two RNN models, the LSTM’s more robust ability to learn long-term dependencies serves it well, giving it a substantial advantage over the plain RNN, and resulting in performance that is essentially equivalent to the lexicalized classifier on the test set (LSTM performance near the stopping iteration varies by up to 0.5% between evaluation steps).",3.3 Sentence embeddings and NLI,[0],[0]

There are revealing patterns in the errors common to all the models considered here.,3.4 Analysis and discussion,[0],[0]

"Semantic mistakes at the phrasal level (e.g., predicting contradiction for A male is placing an order in a deli/A man buying a sandwich at a deli) indicate that additional attention to compositional semantics would pay off.",3.4 Analysis and discussion,[0],[0]
"However, many of the persistent problems run deeper, to inferences that depend on world knowledge and contextspecific inferences, as in the entailment pair A race car driver leaps from a burning car/A race car driver escaping danger, for which both the lexicalized classifier and the LSTM predict neutral.",3.4 Analysis and discussion,[0],[0]
"In other cases, the models’ attempts to shortcut
this kind of inference through lexical cues can lead them astray.",3.4 Analysis and discussion,[0],[0]

"To the extent that successfully training a neural network model like our LSTM on SNLI forces that model to encode broadly accurate representations of English scene descriptions and to build an entailment classifier over those relations, we should expect it to be readily possible to adapt the trained model for use on other NLI tasks.",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
"In this section, we evaluate on the SICK entailment task using a simple transfer learning method (Pratt et al., 1991) and achieve competitive results.
",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]

softmax layer parameters and the embeddings for words that appear in SICK, but not in SNLI (which are populated with GloVe embeddings as above).",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
"We use the same model hyperparameters that were used to train the original model, with the exception of the L2 regularization strength, which is re-tuned.",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
We additionally transfer the accumulators that are used by AdaDelta to set the learning rates.,4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
"This lowers the starting learning rates, and is intended to ensure that the model does not learn too quickly in its first few epochs after transfer and destroy the knowledge accumulated in the pre-transfer phase of training.
",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
The results are shown in Table 7.,4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
"Training on SICK alone yields poor performance, and the model trained on SNLI fails when tested on SICK data, labeling more neutral examples as contradictions than correctly, possibly as a result of subtle differences in how the labeling task was presented.",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
"In contrast, transferring SNLI representations to SICK yields the best performance yet reported for an unaugmented neural network model, surpasses the available EOP models, and approaches both the overall state of the art at 84.6% (Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014) and the 84% level of interannotator agreement, which likely represents an approximate performance ceiling.",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
"This suggests that the introduction of a large high-quality corpus makes it possible to train representation-learning models for sentence meaning that are competitive with the best hand-engineered models on inference tasks.

"We attempted to apply this same transfer evaluation technique to the RTE-3 challenge, but found that the small training set (800 examples) did not allow the model to adapt to the unfamiliar genre of text used in that corpus, such that no training configuration yielded competitive performance.",4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
Further research on effective transfer learning on small data sets with neural models might facilitate improvements here.,4 Transfer learning with SICK,[0],[0]
"Natural languages are powerful vehicles for reasoning, and nearly all questions about meaningfulness in language can be reduced to questions of entailment and contradiction in context.",5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This suggests that NLI is an ideal testing ground for theories of semantic representation, and that training for NLI tasks can provide rich domain-general semantic representations.",5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"To date, however, it has not been possible to fully realize this potential due to the limited nature of existing NLI resources.",5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This paper sought to remedy this with a new, largescale, naturalistic corpus of sentence pairs labeled for entailment, contradiction, and independence.",5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We used this corpus to evaluate a range of models, and found that both simple lexicalized models and neural network models perform well, and that the representations learned by a neural network model on our corpus can be used to dramatically improve performance on a standard challenge dataset.",5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We hope that SNLI presents valuable training data and a challenging testbed for the continued application of machine learning to semantic representation.,5 Conclusion,[0],[0]
