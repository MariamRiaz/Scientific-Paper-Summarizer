6	24	Traditional measures of complexity such as VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity fail to explain this phenomenon.
7	19	Understanding this implicit regularization that begets the generalization power of deep neural networks remains a challenge.
8	58	The goal of our work is to establish connections between neural network and tropical geometry in the hope that they will shed light on the workings of deep neural networks.
11	33	For standard and trigonometric polynomials, it is known that rational approximation — approximating a target function by a ratio of two polynomials instead of a single polynomial — vastly improves the quality of approximation without increasing the degree.
15	43	In fact, we will show that: the family of functions represented by feedforward neural networks with rectified linear units and integer weights is exactly the family of tropical rational maps.
25	40	Roughly speaking, tropical algebraic geometry is an analogue of classical algebraic geometry over C, the field of complex numbers, but where one replaces C by a semifield2 called the tropical semiring, to be defined below.
29	37	The two operations ⊕ and , called tropical addition and tropical multiplication respectively, are defined as follows.
31	21	Thus −∞ is the tropical additive identity and 0 is the tropical multiplicative identity.
33	17	While it is not a ring (lacks additive inverse), one may nonetheless generalize many algebraic objects (e.g., matrices, polynomials, tensors, etc) and notions (e.g., rank, determinant, degree, etc) over the tropical semiring — the study of these, in a nutshell, constitutes the subject of tropical algebra.
53	19	We will denote a tropical rational function by f g, where f and g are understood to be tropical polynomial functions.
58	46	A d-variate tropical polynomial f(x) defines a function f : Rd → R that is a convex function in the usual sense as taking max and sum of convex functions preserve convexity (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).
63	60	, fp are tropical rational functions.
64	29	We will denote the set of tropical polynomial maps by Pol(d, p) and the set of tropical rational maps by Rat(d, p).
66	32	Tropical hypersurfaces are a principal object of interest in tropical geometry and will prove very useful in our approach towards neural networks.
67	32	Intuitively, the tropical hypersurface of a tropical polynomial f is the set of points x where f is not linear at x.
72	25	For example, the cell where a tropical monomial cjx αj attains its maximum is {x ∈ Rd : cj + αTjx ≥ ci + αTix for all i 6= j}.
85	30	Thus, the number of vertices in P(f) provides an upper bound on the number of linear regions of f .
86	44	Figure 1 shows the Newton polygon and dual subdivision for the tropical polynomial f(x1, x2) = 1 x21 ⊕ 1 x22 ⊕ 2 x1x2 ⊕ 2 x1 ⊕ 2 x2 ⊕ 2.
90	24	A linear region of F ∈ Rat(d,m) is a maximal connected subset of the domain on which F is linear.
91	108	The number of linear regions of F is denoted N (F ).
94	17	Our analysis of neural networks will require figuring out how the polytope P(f) transforms under tropical power, sum, and product.
98	65	The Minkowski sum of two sets P1 and P2 in Rd is the set P1 + P2 := { x1 + x2 ∈ Rd : x1 ∈ P1, x2 ∈ P2 } ; and for λ1, λ2 ≥ 0, their weighted Minkowski sum is λ1P1+λ2P2 := { λ1x1+λ2x2 ∈ Rd : x1 ∈ P1, x2 ∈ P2 } .
100	35	In particular, the Minkowski sum of line segments is called a zonotope.
159	22	Theorem 5.2 (Tropical characterization of neural networks).
171	28	We would like to acknowledge the precedence of (Arora et al., 2018, Theorem 2.1), which demonstrates the equivalence between ReLU-activatedL-layer neural networks with real weights and d-variate continuous piecewise functions with real coefficients, where L ≤ dlog2(d+ 1)e+ 1.
177	19	Let ν : Rd → R. Then ν is a continuous piecewise linear function with integer coefficients if and only if ν is a tropical rational function.
183	22	The need to stay within tropical algebraic geometry is the reason we did not go for a simpler and more general characterization (that does not require the integer coefficients assumption).
191	19	Nevertheless tropical signomials fall outside the realm of tropical algebraic geometry and we do not use Proposition 5.6 in the rest of this article.
192	71	Section 5 defines neural networks via tropical algebra, a perspective that allows us to study them via tropical algebraic geometry.
194	24	We will see that, in an appropriate sense, zonotopes form the geometric building blocks for neural networks (Section 6.2).
