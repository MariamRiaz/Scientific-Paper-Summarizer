"Despite the massive success brought by neural machine translation (NMT, Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017), it has been noticed that the vanilla NMT often lags behind conventional machine translation systems, such as statistical phrase-based translation systems (PBMT, Koehn et al., 2003), for low-resource language pairs (see, e.g., Koehn and Knowles, 2017).",1 Introduction,[0.9748239138454291],"['Many research efforts have been spent on incorporating the monolingual corpora into machine translation, such as multi-task learning (Gulcehre et al., 2015; Zhang and Zong, 2016), back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2015), dual learning (He et al., 2016) and unsupervised machine translation with monolingual corpora only for both sides (Artetxe et al., 2017b; Lample et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018).']"

"It was later followed by approaches based on multilingual translation, in which the goal was to exploit knowledge from high-resource language pairs by training a single NMT system on a mix of high-resource and low-resource language pairs (Firat et al., 2016a,b; Lee et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016b).",1 Introduction,[0.9522547153583513],"['Universal Lexical Representation (ULR) We tackle this issue by dynamically building a vocabulary specific to each language using a keyvalue memory network (Miller et al., 2016; Gulcehre et al., 2018), as was done successfully for low-resource machine translation recently by Gu et al.

"We start by arguing that the recently proposed model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML, Finn et al., 2017) could be applied to low-resource machine translation by viewing language pairs as separate tasks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This view enables us to use MAML to find the initialization of model parameters that facilitate fast adaptation for a new language pair with a minimal amount of training examples (§3).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, the vanilla MAML however cannot handle tasks with mismatched input and output.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We overcome this limitation by incorporating the universal lexical representation (Gu et al., 2018b) and adapting it for the meta-learning scenario (§3.3).

approach across all the target language pairs, and the gap grows as the number of training examples decreases.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Neural Machine Translation (NMT),2 Background,[0],[0]
"Given a source sentence X = {x1, ..., xT 0}, a neural machine translation model factors the distribution over possible output sentences Y = {y1, ..., yT } into a chain of conditional probabilities with a leftto-right causal structure:
p(Y |X; ✓) = T+1Y
t=1
p(yt|y0:t 1, x1:T 0 ; ✓), (1)
where special tokens y0 (hbosi) and yT+1 (heosi) are used to represent the beginning and the end of a target sentence.",2 Background,[0],[0]
These conditional probabilities are parameterized using a neural network.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"Typically, an encoder-decoder architecture (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) with a RNN-based decoder is used.",2 Background,[0],[0]

vs. Multilingual Transfer Learning We metalearn the initial models on all the source tasks using either Ro-En or Lv-En as a validation task.,5 Results,[1.0],['vs. Multilingual Transfer Learning We metalearn the initial models on all the source tasks using either Ro-En or Lv-En as a validation task.']
We also train the initial models to be multilingual translation systems.,5 Results,[0],[0]
"We fine-tune them using the four target tasks (Ro-En, Lv-En, Fi-En and Tr-En; 16k tokens each) and compare the proposed meta-learning strategy and the multilingual, transfer learning strategy.",5 Results,[0],[0]
"As presented in Fig. 3, the proposed learning approach significantly outperforms the multilingual, transfer learning strategy across all the target tasks regardless of which target task was used for early stopping.",5 Results,[0],[0]
We also notice that the emb+enc strategy is most effective for both meta-learning and transfer learning approaches.,5 Results,[0],[0]
"With the proposed meta-learning and emb+enc fine-tuning, the final NMT systems trained using only a fraction of all available training examples achieve 2/3 (Ro-En) and 1/2 (Lv-En, Fi-En and Tr-En) of the BLEU score achieved by the models trained with full training sets.

"We obtain 4.79(±0.234) BLEU point, which is higher than the standard NMT performance (0 BLEU).",5 Results,[0],[0]
"It is however still lower than both the multi-NMT and meta-NMT.

"Impact of Validation Tasks Similarly to training any other neural network, meta-learning still requires early-stopping to avoid overfitting to a
specific set of source tasks.",5 Results,[0],[0]
"In doing so, we observe that the choice of a validation task has nonnegligible impact on the final performance.",5 Results,[0],[0]
"For instance, as shown in Fig. 3, Fi-En benefits more when Ro-En is used for validation, while the opposite happens with Tr-En.",5 Results,[0],[0]

"Training Set Size We vary the size of the target task’s training set and compare the proposed meta-learning strategy and multilingual, transfer learning strategy.",5 Results,[1.0],"['Training Set Size We vary the size of the target task’s training set and compare the proposed meta-learning strategy and multilingual, transfer learning strategy.']"
We use the emb+enc fine-tuning on Ro-En and Fi-En.,5 Results,[0],[0]
Fig. 4 demonstrates that the meta-learning approach is more robust to the drop in the size of the target task’s training set.,5 Results,[0],[0]
"The gap between the meta-learning and transfer learning grows as the size shrinks, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach on extremely lowresource language pairs.

MetaNMT,5 Results,[0],[0]
"on the other hand continues to improve and never degrades, as the metaobjective ensures that the model is adequate for fine-tuning on target tasks rather than for solving the source tasks.

Sample Translations We present some sample translations from the tested models in Table 3.,5 Results,[0],[0]
Inspecting these examples provides the insight into the proposed meta-learning algorithm.,5 Results,[0],[0]
"For instance, we observe that the meta-learned model without any fine-tuning produces a word-by-word translation in the first example (Tr-En), which is due to the successful use of the universal lexcial representation and the meta-learned initialization.",5 Results,[0],[0]
"The system however cannot reorder tokens from Turkish to English, as it has not seen any training example of Tr-En.",5 Results,[0],[0]
"After seeing around 600 sentence pairs (16K English tokens), the model rapidly learns to correctly reorder tokens to form a better translation.",5 Results,[1.0],"['After seeing around 600 sentence pairs (16K English tokens), the model rapidly learns to correctly reorder tokens to form a better translation.']"
A similar phenomenon is observed in the Ko-En example.,5 Results,[0],[0]
These cases could be found across different language pairs.,5 Results,[0],[0]
