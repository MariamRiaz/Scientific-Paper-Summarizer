19	1	In this paper we present PANDA (Part Name Discovery Analytics), a fast and scalable method that exploits statistical, linguistic and supervised machine learning techniques in a unique way such that minimal human supervision is sufficient to discover thousands of part names from noisy text.
55	1	The intent of Part Name Discovery Analytics (PANDA) is primarily to extract part information in the domain of aircraft to support vehicle health management by exploiting hundreds of thousands of free text records.
56	2	However, its use can extend to any large data sets containing part name mentions.
58	1	This allows discovery of new parts and at the same time minimizes the expensive training process required for supervised machine learning.
78	5	Parts predicted by CRF and trie in the last run are collected as the final output.
84	2	To further ensure better examples are used in the training example generation process, we could have a constraint to only use the Heads having certain minimum frequency.
92	3	PANDA currently employs k-previous and k-next word tokens and their POS tags as well as the POS tags of part names themselves as these features.
93	1	The POS features can be generated using a POS Tagger such as Brill Tagger (Brill, 1992).
101	3	It extracts the last token of the supplied part and returns that as the Head.
109	1	PANDA supports various types of stopping criteria.
116	3	It contains reasons for significant delays in departure or landing, often due to the condition of one or more parts/systems.
117	4	(c) Communication Systems (CS) includes professional help desk type correspondence between an aircraft manufacturing company and airline operators.
119	1	All data sets contained multiple records, had comparable sizes of 1 million tokens each, and were subject to the same preprocessing steps and POS-tagging.
124	1	SME’s feedback to predicted Heads in each iteration as Good, Bad and Borderline heads, defined in Section 3.7, are also presented in the table.
129	1	It extracted 9374 full parts at the end of the final iteration but only required annotations of 780 part Heads.
137	6	Therefore, we randomly selected 1000 parts for evaluation.
140	3	As noted in Section 2, the only known algorithm in the literature to extract part names from free text is by Chandramouli, Subramanian, and Bal (2013).
142	6	We implemented their best performing algorithm that purifies parts with POS tags as baseline.
145	3	Since the baseline relies on provided Heads - 36 in this case - and has no way of inferring new part Heads and their corresponding parts, it suffers from low recall.
146	2	PANDA, on the other hand can easily infer new Heads and associated parts.
150	4	Baseline results contained 186 such over-generated parts.
152	2	In contrast, the baseline generated door panel (a non-existence part) as well as access door panel.
155	4	Lastly, the baseline generated incorrect parts when there were more than one head in a part name.
159	3	To test the generality of PANDA across different genres of part records, we ran PANDA on MLB, SI and BCS data sets for 5 iterations each.
160	6	As noted above, MLB and SI are very noisy compared to BCS.
173	8	We presented PANDA, a novel approach that discovers part names in noisy text.
174	38	PANDA cleverly exploits the linguistic characteristics of part names in English to automatically generate full part names using basic part names.
175	32	This automates the training example generation process, the most expensive step for building a supervised machine learning model.
176	117	Experiments demonstrated that: • PANDA required minimal human input for training the machine learning model • PANDA was superior to the existing sys- tem in that it was able to infer new heads and parts and dramatically improved recall as compared to the existing system • PANDA extracted high quality full parts • PANDA can scale across diverse data sets With these promising results, PANDA is currently being deployed to extract part names from several data sets for different aircraft models and subsystems.
177	109	In the future, we plan to focus on the normalization of heads (e.g. pnl and panal to panel) and parts (e.g. lft valve and left vlv to left valve) from PANDA extracted results.
