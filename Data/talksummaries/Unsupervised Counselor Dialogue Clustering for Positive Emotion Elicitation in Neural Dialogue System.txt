0	23	Emotionally intelligent systems has high potential as assistive technology in various affective tasks, such as caring for the elderly, low-cost ubiquitous chat therapy, or providing emotional support in general.
1	27	Two of the most studied emotional competences for agents are emotion recognition, which allows a system to discern the user’s emotions and address them in giving a response (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2012; Han et al., 2015; Tielman et al., 2014), and emotion simulation, which helps convey non-verbal aspects to the user for a more believable and human-like interaction, for example to show empathy (Higashinaka et al., 2008) or personality (Egges et al., 2004).
4	29	Recently, there has been an increasing interest in eliciting user’s emotional response via dialogue system interaction, i.e. emotion elicitation.
5	89	Skowron et al. (2013) have studied the impact of different affective personalities in a text-based dialogue system, while Hasegawa et al. (2013) constructed translation-based response generators with various emotion targets.
8	56	This can be achieved by actively eliciting a more positive emotional valence throughout the interaction, i.e. positive emotion elicitation.
9	71	This takes form as a chat-oriented dialogue system interaction that is layered with an implicit goal to address user’s emotional needs.
10	31	With recent advancements in neural network research, end-to-end approaches have been reported to show promising results for non-goal oriented dialogue systems (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2016; Nio et al., 2016).
14	17	Towards positive emotion elicitation, Lubis et al. (2018) have recently proposed a model that encodes emotion information from user input and utilizes it in generating response.
15	38	However, the resulting system is still limited to short and generic responses with positive affect, echoing the long standing lack-of-diversity problem in neural network based response generation (Li et al., 2016).
16	22	Furthermore, the reported system has not learn about positive emotion elicitation strategies from an expert as the corpus construction relied on crowd-sourcing workers.
17	24	This points to another problem: the lack of data that shows positive emotion elicitation or emotion recovery in everyday situations.
22	87	Second, we extract higher level information from the expert’s responses via unsupervised clustering and use the resulting labels to train a neural dialogue system.
23	107	Lastly, we propose a hierarchical neural dialogue system which considers 1) expert’s action, 2) dialogue context, and 3) user emotion, in generating a response by encoding them from user input.
27	19	To fill these gaps, we design our corpus to 1) contain recordings of spontaneous dyadic interactions before and after a negative emotion exposure, and 2) involve a professional counselor as an expert.
28	23	In each interaction, a negative emotion inducer is shown to the dyad, and the goal of the expert is to aid emotion processing and elicit a positive emotional change through the interaction.
49	17	Afterwards, we induce negative emotion by showing an emotion inducer to the dyad.
51	27	In total, we recorded 60 sessions of interactions, 30 with “anger” inducer and 30 with “sadness”.
58	24	For each recording, the participants self report their emotional state using the FEELtrace system (Cowie et al., 2000) immediately after the interaction.
97	28	Especially with subjective aspects such as dialogue act labels, they are often less reliable due to low annotator agreement.
121	21	The largest sub-cluster is sub-cluster 2 with 1324 members which contain longer utterances, a combination of opinion, questions, and other sentences.
186	18	We compute the average test triple length (59.6 tokens), and group the test triples into two: those with below average length as “short” (294 triples), and those above as “long” (186).
188	17	We obtain model with the lowest perplexity when emotion and K-Means labels are both utilized in the training and response generation process.
190	22	More significant improvement is observed on long test triples.
191	39	Looking at the perplexity on all test triples, interestingly, the two cluster labels are affected in starkly different ways when combined with emotion labels: K-Means gain significant improvement, while DPGMM slightly suffers.
197	18	We present human judges with a dialogue triple and ask them to rate the response in terms of three criteria: 1) naturalness, which evaluates whether the response is intelligible, logically follows the dialogue context, and resembles real human response, 2) emotional impact, to measure whether the response elicits a positive emotional impact or promotes an emotionally positive conversation, and 3) engagement, to evaluate whether the proposed response shows involvement in the dialogue and promotes longer conversation by inviting more response.
209	47	We construct a corpus containing recordings of a counselor and 30 participants following a negative emotional exposure to learn expert responses in a positive emotion elicitation scenario.
210	76	We unsupervisedly cluster the expert’s responses and use the resulting labels to train a dialogue system.
211	28	We proposed a novel hierarchical neural architecture for response generation that is conditioned on 1) expert’s action, 2) dialogue context, and 3) user emotion, encoded from user input.
214	37	In the future, we would like to consider emotional impact explicitly for the emotion elicitation in lieu of a data-driven approach of positive emotion elicitation.
215	77	We would also like to consider other modalitiesm such as speech, for a richer emotion encoding.
