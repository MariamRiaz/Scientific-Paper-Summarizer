However, this assumption often does not hold in reality, as occlusions and noisy sensors may limit the agent\u2019s perceptual abilities. Such problems can be formalised as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) (Astrom, 1965; Kaelbling et al., 1998). Because we usually do not have access to the true generative model of our environment, there is a need for reinforcement learning methods that can tackle POMDPs when only a stream of observations is given, without any prior knowledge of the latent state space or the transition and observation functions.\nPOMDPs are notoriously hard to solve: since the current ob-\n1University of Oxford, United Kingdom 2University of British Columbia, Canada.

The networks are updated end-to-end with an RL loss.\n(b) DVRL. The agent learns a generative model which is used to update a belief distribution. Actor and critic now condition on the belief. The generative model is learned to optimise both the ELBO and the RL loss.\nFigure 1: Comparison of RNN and DVRL encoders.\nservation does in general not carry all relevant information for choosing an action, information must be aggregated over time and in general, the entire history must be taken into account.\nThis history can be encoded either by remembering features of the past (McCallum, 1993) or by performing inference to determine the distribution over possible latent states (Kaelbling et al., 1998). However, the computation of this belief state requires knowledge of the model.\nMost previous work on deep learning in POMDPs relies on training a recurrent neural network (RNN) to summarise the past. Examples are the deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) (Hausknecht & Stone, 2015) and the action-specific deep recurrent Q-network (ADRQN) (Zhu et al., 2017). Because these approaches are completely model-free, they place a heavy burden on the RNN. Since performing inference implicitly requires a known or learned model, they are likely to summarise the history either by only remembering features of the past or by computing simple heuristics instead of actual belief states. This is often suboptimal in complex tasks. Generalisation is also often easier over beliefs than\nover trajectories since distinct histories can lead to similar or identical beliefs.\nThe premise of this work is that deep policy learning for POMDPs can be improved by taking less of a black box approach than DRQN and ADRQN. While we do not want to assume prior knowledge of the transition and observation functions or the latent state representation, we want to allow the agent to learn models of them and infer the belief state using these learned models.\nTo this end, we propose DVRL, which implements this approach by providing a helpful inductive bias to the agent. In particular, we develop an algorithm that can learn an internal generative model and use it to perform approximate inference to update the belief state. Crucially, the generative model is not only learned based on an ELBO objective, but also by how well it enables maximisation of the expected return. This ensures that, unlike in an unsupervised application of variational autoencoders (VAEs), the latent state representation and the inference performed on it are suitable for the ultimate control task. Specifically, we develop an approximation to the ELBO based on autoencoding sequential Monte Carlo (AESMC) (Le et al., 2018), allowing joint optimisation with the n-step policy gradient update. Uncertainty in the belief state is captured by a particle ensemble. A high-level overview of our approach in comparison to previous RNN-based methods is shown in Figure 1.\nWe evaluate our approach on Mountain Hike and several flickering Atari games. On Mountain Hike (a low dimensional, continuous environment), we can show that DVRL is better than an RNN based approach at inferring the required information from past observations for optimal action selection in a simple setting. Our results on flickering Atari show that this advantage extends to complex environments with high dimensional observation spaces. Here, partial observability is introduced by (1) using only a single frame as input at each time step and (2) returning a blank screen instead of the true frame with probability 0.5."}, {"heading": "2.

When an action at \u2208 A is executed, the state changes accord-\ning to the transition distribution, st+1 \u223c F (st+1|st, at). Subsequently, the agent receives a noisy or partially occluded observation ot+1 \u2208 O according to the distribution ot+1 \u223c U(ot+1|st+1, at), and a reward rt+1 \u2208 R according to the distribution rt+1 \u223c R(rt+1|st+1, at).\nAn agent acts according to its policy \u03c0(at|o\u2264t, a<t) which returns the probability of taking action at at time t, and where o\u2264t = (o1, . . . , ot) and a<t = (a0, . . . , at\u22121) are the observation and action histories, respectively.

This can be accomplished by memory based approaches, for example by using suffix trees (McCallum & Ballard, 1996; Shani et al., 2005; Bellemare et al., 2014; Bellemare, 2015; Messias & Whiteson, 2017).

It extends the RNN-based approach to explicitly support belief inference.

This avoids drawing entire trajectories from a replay buffer and allows continuous actions.\nFurthermore, since A2C interleaves unrolled trajectories and performs a parameter update only every ns steps, it makes it feasible to maintain an approximately correct latent state. A small bias is introduced by not recomputing the latent state after each gradient update step.\nWe also modify the implementation of backpropagationthrought-time (BPTT) for n-step A2C in the case of policies with latent states. Instead of backpropagating gradients only through the computation graph of the current update involving ns steps, we set the size of the computation graph independently to involve ng steps. This leads to an average BPTT-length of (ng \u2212 1)/2.2 This decouples the biasvariance tradeoff of choosing ns from the bias-runtime tradeoff of choosing ng.

Related Work", "text": "Most existing POMDP literature focusses on planning algorithms, where the transition and observation functions, as well as a representation of the latent state space, are known (Barto et al., 1995; McAllester & Singh, 1999; Pineau et al., 2003; Ross et al., 2008; Oliehoek et al., 2008; Roijers et al., 2015). In most realistic domains however, these are not known a priori.\nThere are several approaches that utilise RNNs in POMDPs (Bakker, 2002; Wierstra et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2015; Heess et al., 2015), including multi-agent settings (Foerster et al., 2016), learning text-based fantasy games (Narasimhan et al., 2015) or, most recently, applied to Atari (Hausknecht & Stone, 2015; Zhu et al., 2017). As discussed in Section 3, our algorithm extends those approaches by enabling the policy to explicitly reason about a model and the belief state.\nAnother more specialised approach called QMDP-Net (Karkus et al., 2017) learns a value iteration network (VIN) (Tamar et al., 2016) end-to-end and uses it as a transition model for planning. However, a VIN makes strong assumptions about the transition function and in QMDP-Net the belief update must be performed analytically.\nThe idea to learn a particle filter based policy that is trained using policy gradients was previously proposed by Coquelin et al. (2009). However, they assume a known model and rely on finite differences for gradient estimation.\nInstead of optimising an ELBO to learn a maximumlikelihood approximation for the latent representation and corresponding transition and observation model, previous work also tried to learn those dynamics using spectral methods (Azizzadenesheli et al., 2016), a Bayesian approach (Ross et al., 2011; Katt et al., 2017), or nonparametrically (Doshi-Velez et al., 2015). However, these approaches do not scale to large or continuous state and observation spaces. For continuous states, actions, and observations with Gaussian noise, a Gaussian process model can be learned (Deisenroth & Peters, 2012). An alternative to learning an (approximate) transition and observation model is to learn a model over trajectories (Willems et al., 1995). However, this is again only possible for small, discrete observation spaces.\nDue to the complexity of the learning in POMDPs, previous work already found benefits to using auxiliary losses. Unlike the losses proposed by Lample & Chaplot (2017), we do not require additional information from the environment. The UNREAL agent (Jaderberg et al., 2016) is, similarly to our work, motivated by the idea to improve the latent representation by utilising all the information already obtained from the environment. While their work focuses on finding unsupervised auxiliary losses that provide good training signals, our goal is to use the auxiliary loss to better align the network computations with the task at hand by incorporating prior knowledge as an inductive bias.\nThere is some evidence from recent experiments on the dopamine system in mice (Babayan et al., 2018) showing that their response to ambiguous information is consistent with a theory operating on belief states."}, {"heading": "5.

Mountain Hike", "text": "In this task, the agent has to navigate along a mountain ridge, but only receives noisy measurements of its current location. Specifically, we have S = O = A = R2 where st = [xt, yt]\nT \u2208 S and ot = [x\u0302t, y\u0302t]T \u2208 O are true and observed coordinates respectively and at = [\u2206xt,\u2206yt]T \u2208 A is the desired step. Transitions are given by st+1 = st+ a\u0303t+ s,t with s,t \u223c N (\u00b7|0, 0.25 \u00b7I) and a\u0303t is the vector at with length capped to \u2016a\u0303t\u2016 \u2264 0.5. Observations are noisy with ot = st+ o,t with o,t \u223c N (\u00b7|0, \u03c3o \u00b7I) and \u03c3o \u2208 {0, 1.5, 3}. The reward at each timestep isRt = r(xt, yt)\u2212 0.01\u2016at\u2016 where r(xt, yt) is shown in Figure 3. The starting position is sampled from s0 \u223c N (\u00b7|[\u22128.5,\u22128.5]T , I) and each episode ends after 75 steps.\nDVRL used 30 particles and we set ng = 25 for both RNN and DVRL. The latent state h for the RNN-encoder architecture was of dimension 256 and 128 for both z and h for\nDVRL. Lastly, \u03bbE = 1 and ns = 5 were used, together with RMSProp with a learning rate of 10\u22124 for both approaches.\nThe main difficulty in Mountain Hike is to correctly estimate the current position. Consequently, the achieved return reflects the capability of the network to do so. DVRL outperforms RNN based policies, especially for higher levels of observation noise \u03c3o (Figure 4). In Figure 3 we compare the different trajectories for RNN and DVRL encoders for the same noise, i.e. RNNs,t = DVRL s,t and RNN o,t = DVRL o,t for all t and \u03c3o = 3. DVRL is better able to follow the mountain ridge, indicating that its inference based history aggregation is superior to a largely memory/heuristics based one.\nThe example in Figure 3 is representative but selected for clarity: The shown trajectories have \u2206J(\u03c3o = 3) = 20.7 compared to an average value of \u2206J\u0304(\u03c3o = 3) = 11.43 (see Figure 4)."}, {"heading": "5.2. Atari", "text": "We chose flickering Atari as evaluation benchmark, since it was previously used to evaluate the performance of ADRQN (Zhu et al., 2017) and DRQN (Hausknecht & Stone, 2015). Atari environments (Bellemare et al., 2013) provide a wide set of challenging tasks with high dimensional observation spaces. We test our algorithm on the same subset of games on which DRQN and ADRQN were evaluated.\nPartial observability is introduced by flickering, i.e., by a probability of 0.5 of returning a blank screen instead of the actual observation. Furthermore, only one frame is used as the observation. This is in line with previous work (Hausknecht & Stone, 2015). We use a frameskip of four3\n3A frameskip of one is used for Asteroids due to known ren-\nand for the stochastic Atari environments there is a 0.25 chance of repeating the current action for a second time at each transition.\nDVRL used 15 particles and we set ng = 50 for both agents. The dimension of h was 256 for both architectures, as was the dimension of z. Larger latent states decreased the performance for the RNN encoder. Lastly, \u03bbE = 0.1 and ns = 5 was used with a learning rate of 10\u22124 for RNN and 2 \u00b7 10\u22124 for DVRL, selected out of a set of 6 different rates based on the results on ChopperCommand.\nTable 1 shows the results for the more challenging stochastic, flickering environments. Results for the deterministic environments, including returns reported for DRQN and ADRQN, can be found in Appendix A. DVRL significantly outperforms the RNN-based policy on five out of ten games and narrowly underperforms significantly on only one. This shows that DVRL is viable for high dimensional observation spaces with complex environmental models."}, {"heading": "5.3. Ablation Studies", "text": "Using more than one particle is important to accurately approximate the belief distribution over the latent state (z, h). Consequently, we expect that higher particle numbers provide better information to the policy, leading to higher returns. Figure 5a shows that this is indeed the case. This is an important result for our architecture, as it also implies that the resampling step is necessary, as detailed in Section 3.4. Without resampling, we cannot approximate the ELBO on only ns observations.\ndering issues with this environment\n0 2 4\nFrames \u00d7107\n2000\n4000\n6000\nR et\nu rn\n1 Particle 3 Particles 10 Particles 30 Particles\n(a) Influence of the particle number on performance for DVRL.

Note that RNN suffers most from very short lengths. This is consistent with our conjecture that RNN relies mostly on memory, not inference.\nFigure 5: Ablation studies on flickering ChopperCommand (Atari).\nSecondly, Figure 5b shows that the inclusion of LELBO to encourage model learning is required for good performance. Furthermore, not backpropagating the policy gradients through the encoder and only learning it based on the ELBO (\u201cNo joint optim\u201d) also deteriorates performance.\nLastly, we investigate the influence of the backpropagation length ng on both the RNN and DVRL based policies. While increasing ng universally helps, the key insight here is that a short length ng = 5 (for an average BPTT-length of 2 timesteps) has a stronger negative impact on RNN than on DVRL. This is consistent with our notion that RNN is mainly performing memory based reasoning, for which longer backpropagation-through-time is required: The belief update (2) in DVRL is a one-step update from bt to bt+1, without the need to condition on past actions and observa-\ntions. The proposal distribution can benefit from extended backpropagation lengths, but this is not necessary. Consequently, this result supports our notion that DVRL relies more on inference computations to update the latent state."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we proposed DVRL, a method for solving POMDPs given only a stream of observations, without knowledge of the latent state space or the transition and observation functions operating in that space. Our method leverages a new ELBO-based auxiliary loss and incorporates an inductive bias into the structure of the policy network, taking advantage of our prior knowledge that an inference step is required for an optimal solution.\nWe compared DVRL to an RNN-based architecture and found that we consistently outperform it on a diverse set of tasks, including a number of Atari games modified to have partial observability and stochastic transitions.\nWe also performed several ablation studies showing the necessity of using an ensemble of particles and of joint optimisation of the ELBO and RL objective. Furthermore, the results support our claim that the latent state in DVRL approximates a belief distribution in a learned model.\nAccess to a belief distribution opens up several interesting research directions. Investigating the role of better generalisation capabilities and the more powerful latent state representation on the policy performance of DVRL can give rise to further improvements. DVRL is also likely to benefit from more powerful model architectures and a disentangled latent state. Furthermore, uncertainty in the belief state and access to a learned model can be used for curiosity driven exploration in environments with sparse rewards."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We would like to thank Wendelin Boehmer and Greg Farquhar for useful discussions and feedback.

Consequently, there is great need for reinforcement learning methods that can tackle such problems given only a stream of rewards and incomplete and noisy observations.

We develop an n-step approximation to the evidence lower bound (ELBO), allowing the model to be trained jointly with the policy.
