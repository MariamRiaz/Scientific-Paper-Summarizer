Among the most widely used and successful approaches for inference of sparse models has been L1 regularization, which, after introduction in the context of linear models with the LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996), has become the standard tool for both directed and undirected models alike (Murphy, 2012).\nDespite its success, however, L1 is a pragmatic compromise. As the closest convex approximation of the idealized\n1Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

Two Bayesian approaches stand out as more accurate models of sparsity than L1. The first, the spike and slab (Mitchell & Beauchamp, 1988), introduces discrete latent variables that directly model the presence or absence of each parameter. This discrete approach is the most direct and accurate representation of a sparsity hypothesis (Mohamed et al., 2012), but the discrete latent space that it imposes is often computationally intractable for models where Bayesian inference is difficult.\nThe second approach to Bayesian sparsity uses the scale mixtures of normals (Andrews & Mallows, 1974), a family of distributions that arise from integrating a zero meanGaussian over an unknown variance as\np(\u03b8) = \u222b \u221e 0 1\u221a 2\u03c0\u03c3 exp { \u2212 \u03b8 2 2\u03c32 } p(\u03c3)d\u03c3. (1)\nScale-mixtures of normals can approximate the discrete spike and slab prior by mixing both large and small values of the variance \u03c32. The implicit prior of L1 regularization, the Laplacian, is a member of the scale mixture family that results from an exponentially distributed variance \u03c32. Thus, mixing densities p(\u03c32) with subexponential tails and more mass near the origin more accurately model sparsity than L1 and are the basis for approaches often referred to as \u201cSparse Bayesian Learning\u201d (Tipping, 2001). Both the Student-t of Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) (MacKay et al., 1994) and the Horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al., 2010) incorporate these properties.\nApplying these favorable, Bayesian approaches to sparsity has been particularly challenging for discrete, undirected models like Boltzmann Machines. Undirected models possess a representational advantage of capturing \u2018collective phenomena\u2019 with no directions of causality, but their likelihoods require an intractable normalizing constant (Murray & Ghahramani, 2004). For a fully observed Boltzmann Machine with x \u2208 {0, 1}D the distribution1 is\np(x|J) = 1 Z(J) exp \u2211 i<j Jijxixj  , (2) 1We exclude biases for simplicity.\nwhere the partition function Z(J) depends on the couplings. Whenever a new set of couplings J are considered during inference, the partition function Z(J) and corresponding density p(x|J) must be reevaluated. This requirement for an an intractable calculation embedded within already-intractable nonconjugate inference has led some to term Bayesian learning of undirected graphical models \u201cdoubly intractable\u201d (Murray et al., 2006). When all 2( D 2) patterns of discrete spike and slab sparsity are added on top of this, we might call this problem \u201ctriply intractable\u201d (Figure 1). Triple-intractability does not mean that this problem is impossible, but it will typically require expensive approaches based on MCMC-within-MCMC (Chen & Welling, 2012).\nHere we present an alternative to MCMC-based approaches for learning undirected models with sparse priors based on stochastic variational inference (Hoffman et al., 2013). We combine three ideas: (i) stochastic gradient variational Bayes (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Titsias & La\u0301zaro-Gredilla, 2014)2, (ii) persistent Markov chains (Younes, 1989), and (iii) a noncentered parameterization of scale-mixture priors, to inherit the benefits of hierarchical Bayesian sparsity in an efficient variational framework. We make the following contributions:\n\u2022 We extend stochastic variational inference to undirected models with intractable normalizing constants by developing a learning algorithm based on persistent Markov chains, which we call Persistent Varia-\n2This is also a type of noncentered parameterization, but of the variational distribution rather than the posterior.\ntional Inference (PVI) (Section 2).\n\u2022 We introduce a reparameterization approach for variational inference under sparsity-inducing scale-mixture priors (e.g. the Laplacian, ARD, and the Horseshoe) that significantly improves approximation quality by capturing scale uncertainty (Section 3). When combined with Gaussian stochastic variational inference, we call this Fadeout.\n\u2022 We demonstrate how a Bayesian approach for learning sparse undirected graphical models with PVI and Fadeout yields significantly improved inferences of both synthetic and real applications in physics and biology (Section 4)."}, {"heading": "2. Persistent Variational Inference", "text": "Background: Learning in undirected models Undirected graphical models, also known as Markov Random Fields, can be written in log-linear form as\np(x|\u03b8) = 1 Z(\u03b8) exp { k\u2211 i=1 \u03b8ifi(x) } , (3)\nwhere i indexes a set of k features {fi(x)}ki=1 and the partition function Z(\u03b8) = \u2211 x exp { \u2211 i \u03b8ifi(x)} normalizes the distribution (Koller & Friedman, 2009). Maximum Likelihood inference selects parameters \u03b8 that maximize the probability of dataD = {x(1), . . . ,x(N)} by ascending the gradient of the (averaged) log likelihood\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8i\n1\nN log p(D|\u03b8) = ED [fi(x)]\u2212 Ep(x|\u03b8) [fi(x)] . (4)\nThe first term in the gradient is a data-dependent average of feature fi(x) over D, while the second term is a dataindependent average of feature fi(x) over the model distribution that often requires sampling (Murphy, 2012)3.\nBayesian learning for undirected models is confounded by the partition function Z(\u03b8). Given the dataD, a prior p(\u03b8), and the log potentials H[x|\u03b8] = \u2212 \u2211 i \u03b8ifi(x) , the posterior distribution of the parameters is\np(\u03b8|D) = p(\u03b8) \u220f i e \u2212H[x(i)|\u03b8]/Z(\u03b8)\u222b\np(\u03b8\u2032) \u220f i e \u2212H[x(i)|\u03b8\u2032]/Z(\u03b8\u2032)d\u03b8\u2032 , (5)\nwhich contains an intractable partition function Z(\u03b8) within the already-intractable evidence term. As a result, most algorithms for Bayesian learning of undirected models require either doubly-intractable MCMC and/or approximations of the likelihood p(x|\u03b8).\n3Depending on the details of the MCMC and the community these approaches are known as Boltzmann Learning, Stochastic Maximum Likelihood, or Persistent Contrastive Divergence (Tieleman, 2008)."}, {"heading": "A tractable estimator for\u2207ELBO of undirected models", "text": "Here we consider how to approximate the intractable posterior in (5) without approximating the partition function Z(\u03b8) or the likelihood p(x|\u03b8) by using variational inference. Variational inference recasts inference with p(\u03b8|D) as an optimization problem of finding a variational distribution q(\u03b8|\u03c6) that is closest to p(\u03b8|D) as measured by KL divergence (Jordan et al., 1999). This can be accomplished by maximizing the Evidence Lower BOund\nL(\u03c6) , Eq [log p(D,\u03b8)\u2212 log q(\u03b8|\u03c6)] \u2264 log p(D). (6)\nFor scalability, we would like to optimize the ELBO with methods that can leverage Monte Carlo estimators of the gradient \u2207\u03c6L(\u03c6). One possible strategy for this would be would be to develop an estimator based on the score function (Ranganath et al., 2014) with a Monte-Carlo approximation of\n\u2207\u03c6L = Eq [ \u2207\u03c6 log q(\u03b8|\u03c6) log\np(D,\u03b8) q(\u03b8|\u03c6)\n] . (7)\nNaively substituting the likelihood (3) in the score function estimator (7) nests the intractable log partition function logZ(\u03b8) within the average over q(\u03b8|\u03c6), making this an untenable (and extremely high variance) approach to inference with undirected models.\nWe can avoid the need for a score-function estimator with the \u2018reparameterization trick\u2019 (Kingma & Welling, 2014;\nRezende et al., 2014; Titsias & La\u0301zaro-Gredilla, 2014) that has been incredibly useful for directed models. Consider a variational approximation q(\u03b8|\u03c6) = \u220f i q(\u03b8i|\u00b5i, si) that is a fully factorized (mean field) Gaussian with means \u00b5 and log standard deviations s. The ELBO expectations under q(\u03b8|\u03c6) can be rewritten as expectations wrt an independent noise source \u223c N (0, I) where4 \u03b8( ) = \u00b5+exp {s} . Then the gradients are\n\u2207\u00b5L = E [\u2207\u03b8 log p(D,\u03b8( ))] , (8) \u2207sL = E [\u2207\u03b8 log p(D,\u03b8( )) (\u03b8( )\u2212 \u00b5)] + 1. (9)\nBecause these expectations require only the gradient of the likelihood \u2207\u03b8 log p(D|\u03b8), the gradient for the undirected model (4) can be substituted to form a nested expectation for \u2207\u03c6L(\u03c6). This can then be used as a Monte Carlo gradient estimator by sampling \u223c N (0, I),x \u223c p(x|\u03b8( )).\nPersistent gradient estimation In Stochastic Maximum Likelihood estimation for undirected models, the intractable gradients of (4) are estimated by sampling p(x|\u03b8). Although sampling-based approaches are slow, they can be made considerably more efficient by running a set of Markov chains in parallel with state that persists between iterations (Younes, 1989). Persistent state maintains the Markov chains near their equilibrium distributions, which means that they can quickly re-equilibrate after perturbations to the parameters \u03b8 during learning.\n4The operator is an element-wise product.\nWe propose variational inference in undirected models based on persistent gradient estimation of \u2207\u03b8 log p(D|\u03b8) and refer to this as Persistent Variational Inference (PVI) (Algorithm in Appendix). Following the notation of PCDn (Tieleman, 2008), PVI-n refers to using n sweeps of Gibbs sampling with persistent Markov chains between iterations. This approach is generally compatible with any estimators of\u2207ELBO that are based on the gradient of the log likelihood, several examples of which are explained in (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Titsias & La\u0301zaro-Gredilla, 2014).\nBehavior of the solution for Gaussian q When the variational approximation is a fully factorized Gaussian q(\u03b8|\u00b5,\u03c3) and the prior is flat p(\u03b8) \u221d 1, the solution to \u00b5?,\u03c3? = argmax\u00b5,\u03c3 L(\u00b5,\u03c3) will satisfy\nED [fi(x)] = Ep\u0303 [fi(x)] , \u03c3?i = 1\nN Ep\u0303 [ ifi(x)] (10)\nwhere p\u0303 = p(x|\u03b8( ))p( ) is an extended system of the original undirected model in which the parameters \u03b8i = \u00b5i + i\u03c3i fluctuate according to the variational distribution. This bridges to the Maximum Likelihood solution as N \u2192 \u221e and \u03c3?i \u2192 0, while accounting for uncertainty in the parameters at finite sample sizes with the inverse of \u2018sensitivity\u2019 Ep\u0303 [ ifi(x)]."}, {"heading": "3.

Noncentered Parameterizations of Hierarchical Priors", "text": "Hierarchical models are powerful because they impose a priori correlations between latent variables that reflect problem-specific knowledge. For scale-mixture priors that promote sparsity, these correlations come in the form of scale uncertainty. Instead of assuming that the scale of a parameter in a model is known a priori, we posit that it is normally distributed with a randomly distributed variance p(\u03c32). The joint prior p(\u03b8|\u03c32)p(\u03c32) gives rise to a strongly curved \u2018funnel\u2019 shape (Figure 2) that illustrates a simple but profound principle about hierarchical models:\nAlgorithm 1 Computing \u2207ELBO for Fadeout Require: Global parameters {\u00b5\u03c4 , s\u03c4} Require: Local parameters {\u00b5\u03b8\u0303, \u00b5log\u03c3, s\u03b8\u0303, slog\u03c3} Require: Hyperprior gradient\u2207log\u03c3,\u03c4 log p(log\u03c3, \u03c4 ) Require: Likelihood gradient\u2207\u03b8p(x|\u03b8) // Sample from variational distribution z1 \u223c N (0, I|\u03c4 |), z2 \u223c N (0, I|\u03b8\u0303|), z3 \u223c N (0, I|\u03c3|) \u03c4 \u2190 \u00b5\u03c4 + exp{s\u03c4} z1 \u03b8\u0303 \u2190 \u00b5\u03b8\u0303 + exp{s\u03b8\u0303} z2 \u03c3 \u2190 exp {\u00b5log \u03c3 + exp {slog \u03c3} z3} \u03b8 \u2190 \u03b8\u0303 \u03c3 // Centered global parameters \u2207\u00b5\u03c4L \u2190 \u2207\u03c4 log p(log \u03c3, \u03c4 ) \u2207s\u03c4L \u2190 exp {s\u03c4} z1 \u2207\u00b5\u03c4L+ 1 // Noncentered local parameters \u2207\u00b5\u03b8\u0303L \u2190 \u03c3 \u2207\u03b8 log p(x|\u03b8)\u2212 \u03b8\u0303 \u2207\u00b5log \u03c3L \u2190 \u03b8 \u2207\u03b8 log p(x|\u03b8) +\u2207log \u03c3 log p(log \u03c3, \u03c4 ) \u2207s\u03b8\u0303L \u2190 exp { s\u03b8\u0303 } z2 \u2207\u00b5\u03b8\u0303L+ 1\n\u2207slog \u03c3L \u2190 exp {slog \u03c3} z3 \u2207\u00b5log \u03c3L+ 1\nas the hyperparameter log \u03c3 decreases and the prior accepts a smaller range of values for \u03b8, normalization increases the probability density at the origin, favoring sparsity. This normalization-induced sharpening has been called called a Bayesian Occam\u2019s Razor (MacKay, 2003).\nWhile normalization-induced sharpening gives rise to sparsity, these extreme correlations are a disaster for meanfield variational inference. Even if a tremendous amount of probability mass is concentrated at the base of the funnel, an uncorrelated mean-field approximation will yield estimates near the top. The result is a potentially non-sparse estimate from a very-sparse prior.\nThe strong coupling of hierarchical funnels also plagues exact methods based on MCMC with slow mixing, but the statistics community has found that these geometry pathologies can be effectively managed by transformations. Many models can be rewritten in a noncentered form where the parameters and hyperparmeters are a priori independen (Papaspiliopoulos et al., 2007; Betancourt & Girolami, 2013). For the scale-mixtures of normals, this change of variables is\n{\u03b8, log \u03c3} \u2192 { \u03b8\n\u03c3 , log \u03c3\n} (11)\nThen \u03b8\u0303 , \u03b8\u03c3 \u223c N(0, 1) while preserving \u03b8\u0303\u03c3 \u223c N(0, \u03c3 2). In noncentered form, the joint prior is independent and well approximated by a mean-field Gaussian, while the likelihood will be variably correlated depending on the strength of the data (Figure 2). In this sense, centered parameterizations (CP) and noncentered parameterizations (NCP) are usually framed as favorable in strong and weak data\nregimes, respectively.5\nWe propose the use of non-centered parameterizations of scale-mixture priors for mean-field Gaussian variational inference. For convenience, we like to call this Fadeout (see next section). Fadeout can be easily implemented by either (i) using the chain rule to derive the gradient of the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) (Algorithm 1) or, for differentiable models, (ii) rewriting models in noncentered form and using automatic differentiation tools such as Stan (Kucukelbir et al., 2017) or autograd6 for ADVI. The only two requirements of the user are the gradient of the likelihood function and a choice of a global hyperprior, several options for which are presented in Table 1.\nEstimators for the centered posterior. Fadeout optimizes a mean-field Gaussian variational distribution over the noncentered parameters q(\u03b8\u0303, log\u03c3). As an estimator for the centered parameters, we use the mean-field property to compute the centered posterior mean as Eq[\u03b8] = Eq[\u03b8\u0303] Eq[\u03c3], giving 7\n\u03b8\u0302 = \u00b5\u03b8\u0303 exp { \u00b5log\u03c3 + 1\n2 e2slog \u03c3\n} (12)\n5Although \u201cweak data\u201d may seem unrepresentative of typical problems in machine learning, it is important to remember that a sufficiently large and expressive model can make most data weak.\n6github.com/HIPS/autograd 7The term 1\n2 e2slog \u03c3 is optional in the sense that including it\ncorresponds to averaging over the hyperparameters, whereas discarding it corresponds to optimizing the hyperparameters (Empirical Bayes).

Connection to Dropout", "text": "Dropout regularizes neural networks by perturbing hidden units in a directed network with multiplicative Bernoulli or Gaussian noise (Srivastava et al., 2014). Although it was originally framed as a heuristic, Dropout has been subsequently interpreted as variational inference under at least two different schemes (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Kingma et al., 2015). Here, we interpret Fadeout the reverse way, where we introduced it as variational inference and now notice that it looks similar to lognormal Dropout.8 If we take the uncertainty in \u03b8\u0303 as low and clamp the other variational parameters, the gradient estimator for Fadeout is:\nz \u223c N (0, I|\u03b8|) \u03c3 \u2190 exp {\u00b5log \u03c3 + exp {slog \u03c3} z} \u03b8 \u2190 \u03b8\u0303 exp {\u00b5log \u03c3 + exp {slog \u03c3} z}\n\u2207\u00b5\u03b8\u0303L \u2190 \u03c3 \u2207\u03b8 log p(x|\u03b8)\u2212 \u03b8\u0303 8Rather than attempting to explain Dropout, the intent is to\nlend intuition about noncentered scale-mixture VI.\nThis is the gradient estimator for a lognormal version of Dropout with an L2 weight penalty of 12 . At each sample from the variational distribution, Fadeout introduces scale noise rather than the Bernoulli noise of Dropout. The connection to Dropout would seem to follow naturally from the common interpretation of scale mixtures as continuous relaxations of spike and slab priors (Engelhardt & Adams, 2014) and the idea that Dropout can be related to variational spike and slab inference (Louizos, 2015)."}, {"heading": "4. Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1. Physics: Inferring Spin Models", "text": "Ising model The Ising model is a prototypical undirected model for binary systems that includes both pairwise interactions and (potentially) sitewise biases.

Since many physical systems are thought to be dominated by a small number of relevant interactions, L1 regularization has been a favored approach for inferring Ising models. Here, we examine how a more accurate model of sparsity based on the Horseshoe prior (Figure 3) can improve inferences in these systems.\nEach coupling Jij and bias parameter hi is given its own scale parameter which are in turn tied under a global HalfCauchy prior for the scales (Figure 3, Appendix).\nSimulated datasets We generated synthetic couplings for two kinds of Ising systems: (i) a slightly sub-critical cubic ferromagnet (Jij > 0 for neighboring spins) and (ii) a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass diluted on an Erdo\u0308sRenyi random graph with average degree 2.

These contacts are have been sufficient to predict the 3D structures of proteins, protein complexes, and RNAs (Marks et al., 2012).\nGroup sparsity Each pairwise factor Jij in a Potts model contains q \u00d7 q parameters capturing all possible joint configurations of xi and xj .

We constructed a synthetic Potts spin glass with a topology inspired by biological macromolecules. We generated synthetic parameters based on contacts in a simulated polymer and sampled 2000 sequences with 2\u00d7 106 steps of Gibbs sampling (Appendix).\nResults for a synthetic protein We inferred couplings with 400 of the sampled sequences using PVI with group sparsity and two standard methods of the field: L2 and Group L1 regularized maximum pseudolikelihood (Appendix). PVI with a noncentered Horseshoe yielded more accurate (Figure 5, right), less shrunk (Figure 5, left) estimates of interactions that were more predictive of the 1600 remaining test sequences (Table 2). The ability to generalize well to new sequences will likely be important to the related problem of predicting mutation effects with unsupervised models of sequence variation (Hopf et al., 2017; Figliuzzi et al., 2015).\nResults for natural sequence variation We applied the hierarchical Bayesian model from the protein simulation to model across-species amino acid covariation in the SH3\ndomain family (Figure 6). Transitioning from simulated to real protein data is particularly challenging for Bayesian methods because available sequence data are highly nonindependent due to a shared evolutionary history. We developed a new method for estimating the effective sample size (Appendix) which, when combined standard sequence reweighting techniques, yielded a reweighted effective sample size of 1,012 from 10,209 sequences.\nThe hierarchical Bayesian approach gave highly localized, sparse estimates of interactions compared to the two predominant methods in the field, L2 and groupL1 regularized pseudolikelihood (Figure 6). When compared to solved 3D structures for SH3 (Appendix), we found that the inferred interactions were considerably more accurate at predicting amino acids close in structure. Importantly, the hierarchical Bayesian approach accomplished this inference of strong, accurate interactions without a need to prespecify hyperparameters such as \u03bb for L2 or L1 regularization.

Although Bayesian methods for inference would be favorable in these contexts, they are rarely used because they require doubly intractable Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we develop a framework for scalable Bayesian inference of discrete undirected models based on two new methods. The first is Persistent VI, an algorithm for variational inference of discrete undirected models that avoids doubly intractable MCMC and approximations of the partition function. The second is Fadeout, a reparameterization approach for variational inference under sparsity-inducing priors that captures a posteriori correlations between parameters and hyperparameters with noncentered parameterizations. We find that, together, these methods for variational inference substantially improve learning of sparse undirected graphical models in simulated and real problems from physics and biology.", "title": "Variational Inference for Sparse and Undirected Models"}
