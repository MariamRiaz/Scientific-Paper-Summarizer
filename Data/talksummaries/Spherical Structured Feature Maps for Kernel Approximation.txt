27	1	Empirically, SSF maps achieve superior performance compared with other methods.
30	1	One earlier work (Rahimi et al., 2007) approximates the shift invariant kernels based on the Bochner’s Theorem.
33	1	According to the Bochner’s theorem, there is a one-to-one corre- spondence between the kernel functions K(x, z) and probability densities p(w) defined on Rd.
36	1	From Bochner’s theorem, the corresponding probability density is also Gaussian.
51	1	Equal weight numerical integration over a d-dimensional sphere Sd := {x ∈ Rd+1 | ‖x‖2 = 1} uses equal weight summation of finite point evaluations of the integrands to approximate the integrals: ∫ Sd f(v)dσ(v) ≈ 1 N N∑ i=1 f(vi) (7) where σ denotes the normalized surface area measure on Sd.
55	1	Particularly, (Brauchart et al., 2014) have proved that maximizing the discrete Riesz s-energy with s ∈ (−2, 0) can generate QMC designs for functions in Sobolev space.
59	1	Rotation invariant property means that K(x, z) = K(Rx, Rz), given any rotation R ∈ SO(d), where SO(d) denotes rotation groups.
60	1	To benefit from rotation invariant property, it is reasonable to construct the feature maps by using spherical equal weight approximation in equation (7) and (8).
70	1	cos ( Φ−(tj)(x− z)Tvi ) = cos ( −Φ−(tj)(x− z)Tvi ) (15) Thus, we achieve equation (16).
72	2	Feature Maps for bth-order Arc-cosine Kernels In this subsection, we discuss the feature maps for bthorder arc-cosine kernels.
85	2	Proof: According to the Lemma 3.1 and the property of the asymptotically uniformly distributed point set V, we obtain equation (22).
93	1	We have discussed the construction of SSF maps in last section.
94	1	However, one unsolved problem is how to obtain the matrix U = [V,−V].
95	1	We employ the discrete Riesz s-energy as the objective function to obtain matrix U because it can generate asymptotically uniformly distributed points on Sd−1 (Brauchart & Grabner, 2015).
99	1	Moreover, by using FFT, matrix U can accelerate the integral approximation which involves projection operations.
101	1	Since U can be constructed by V, i.e. U = [V,−V], we only need to define structured matrix V. To achieve loglinear time complexity of SSF maps construction, we construct V by extracting rows from a discrete Fourier matrix.
102	1	The complexity analysis of SSF maps construction based on matrix V is given in section 5.
103	1	Mathematically, the construction of matrix V is shown as follows.
105	1	Let Λ = [k1, k2, ..., km] ⊂ {1, ..., n− 1} be a subset of indexes.
114	1	In the following, we will discuss how to minimize equation (25) by using a coordinate decent method.
117	1	Proof: Since U = [V,−V] ∈ S(d−1)×2N, we obtain equation (27).
118	1	E(U) = − 2N∑ i=1 2N∑ j=1,j6=i log ‖ui − uj‖ = −2 N∑ i=1 log ‖2vi‖ −2 N∑ i=1 N∑ j=1,j 6=i (log ‖vi − vj‖+ log ‖vi + vj‖) = C − 2 N∑ i=1 N∑ j=1,j 6=i log (‖vi − vj‖ ‖vi + vj‖) = C − 2 N∑ i=1 N∑ j=1,j 6=i log (√ 2− 2vTi vj √ 2 + 2vTi vj ) (27) Recall that N = 2n.
137	1	Obviously, it is a discrete optimization problem.
142	1	Given Λ = [k1, k2, ..., km] ⊂ {1, ..., n − 1} , let y ∈ Cn with yΛ = z.
148	1	All steps to construct SSF maps are summarized as follows: (a) Compute x̃ by x̃ = Dx, where D ∈ {−1,+1}d×d is a diagonal matrix where diagonal elements are uniformly sampled from {−1,+1}.
153	2	It takes O(m) space to store Λ.
178	1	Figure 3 shows that the feature maps obtained with fully Gaussian matrix, the Circulant matrix, QMC with Halton set and QMC with Sobol set have similar reconstruction error.
181	17	Moreover, even if M = 1, SSF maps can achieve about one-third relative mean error and half of the relative max error of other methods for Gaussian Kernel approximation.
182	73	We propose Spherical Structured Feature (SSF) maps to approximate shift and rotation invariant kernels as well as bthorder arc-cosine kernels.
183	68	SSF maps can achieve computation and storage efficiency as well as better approximation accuracy.
