In particular, computing an (\u03b5, k)-proj-sketch, our algorithm only needs O(nnz(A)k) time (ignoring lower order terms) as opposed to O(nnz(A)k\u03b5\u22121 \u00b7 log d) in (Ghashami et al., 2016) (see Table 1).

We provide a result about row sampling, which is analogous to a result from (Drineas et al., 2006). The difference is that they use iid sampling, i.e., each row of B is an iid sample from the rows ofA. On the other hand, we use Bernoulli sampling, i.e., sample each Ai independently with some probability qi, and B is the set of sampled rows. Bernoulli sampling can easily be combined with FD in the streaming model. The proof is essentially the same as that for iid sampling, which can be found in the supplementary material. Theorem 2. For any A \u2208 Rn\u00d7d and F > 0, we sample each row Ai with probability pi \u2265 \u2016Ai\u2016 2\n\u03b12F ; if it is sampled, scale it by 1/ \u221a pi.

For our application, we only need a constant approximation, and only require Z to contain O(k) rows. For this purpose, we give a simplified algorithm with slightly better running time than directly applying the results from (Clarkson & Woodruff, 2013). We require high success probability, which can be achieved using similar techniques as in (Boutsidis et al., 2016). The proof of the following theorem can be found in the supplementary file.

To speed up FD, we will use the idea of adaptive random sampling. Let us first review the standard FD algorithm. Given an integer parameter ` \u2264 d, the algorithm always maintains a matrix B with at most 2` rows at any time. When a new row v arrives, it processes the row using FDShrink(B, v, `) (Algorithm 3). In this procedure, we first append a after B; if B has no more than 2` rows we do nothing, and otherwise we do a DenseShrink operation (Algorithm 1) on B, which halves the number of rows in B (after removing zero rows).

The space is dominated by maintainingB = FD(A, 1/2k, k) andQ = FD(Cs, \u03b1, 0), which is O(dk + d/\u03b1) in total.\nThe running time of computing B is O(ndk), and the running time for Q is O(rows(Cs)d/\u03b1). To bound rows(Cs), we divide the stream into epochs, where F roughly doubles in each epoch. This means the total number of epochs is bounded by O(log(nd)), since we assume each real number in the input can be represented by O(log(nd)) bits2. Applying Theorem 2 on the submatrix in each epoch, it is easy to check the expected number of rows sampled in each epoch is O(1/\u03b12), so rows(Cs) = O( log(nd) \u03b12 ). Thus the total running time is O(ndk) + O\u0303(d\u03b1\u22123). We remark that the residual return by DenseShrinkR is in the form of C = \u03a3V T , where \u03a3 is diagonal and V has orthonormal columns. Therefore, the row norms of C are simply the diagonals of \u03a3."}, {"heading": "4. Algorithm for sparse matrices", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1. Overview of our algorithm", "text": "Our approach is quite different from (Ghashami et al., 2016). Their main idea is to use fast approximate SVD (Musco & Musco, 2015) in the original FD, which leads to suboptimal time. Our approach is summarized as follows.\n1. Decompose ATA = A\u2032TA\u2032 +RTR, such that A\u2032 contains small number of rows and \u2016A\u2032\u2212[A\u2032]k\u20162F = O(1)\u00b7 \u2016A\u2212 [A]k\u20162F . Moreover, \u2016R\u20162F = O(1) \u00b7\u2016A\u2212 [A]k\u20162F .\n2.

The final sketch is S = [B;C].\nNote that S = [B;C] approximate [A\u2032;R] in the sense that\n\u2016A\u2032TA\u2032 +RTR\u2212BTB \u2212 CTC\u20162 \u2264 \u2016A\u2032TA\u2032 \u2212BTB\u20162 + \u2016RTR\u2212 CTC\u20162 \u2264 O(\u03b1) \u00b7 \u2016A\u2212 [A]k\u20162F .\nFrom step (1), we have ATA = A\u2032TA\u2032 + RTR, and thus [B;C] is a good approximation of A. Next we briefly describe how to implement this in one pass and small space.\nTo achieve (1), we use the following new idea. Let Z \u2208 RO(k)\u00d7d be an orthonormal matrix satisfying \u2016A \u2212 ZTZA\u20162F \u2264 O(1)\u2016A \u2212 [A]k\u20162F . Let A\u2032 = ZA and R = (I \u2212 ZTZ)A. It is easy to check that A\u2032 and R satisfy the requirement of (1). In the streaming model, we divide A into blocks, each of which contains roughly dk non-zero entries, and thus there are at most t = nnz(A)dk blocks. We use the above idea for each of the blocks and concatenate the results together. More precisely, for each block A(i) \u2208 R`i\u00d7d, we use an input-sparsity time algorithm (Theorem 3) to compute a matrix Z(i) \u2208 RO(k)\u00d7`i such that\n\u2016A(i) \u2212 Z(i)TZ(i)A(i)\u20162F \u2264 4\u2016A(i) \u2212 [A(i)]k\u20162F .\nLet A\u2032(i) = Z(i)A(i), and R(i) = (I \u2212 Z(i)TZ(i))A(i). We then set A\u2032 = [A\u2032(1); \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;A\u2032(t)] and R = [R(1); \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;R(t)], and prove that A\u2032 and R satisfy the requirement of (1), where A\u2032 only has t\u00d7O(k) = O( nnz(A)d ) rows (since each block of A\u2032 has O(k) rows). Here we do not compute R explicitly, as we will sample a subset of the rows from R. Note that the running time of this step is dominated by computing Z(i)A(i), which is O(nnz(A(i))k), and thus O(nnz(A)k) in total.\nTo compute B of step (2), we may use the standard FD(A\u2032, \u03b1, k) (Theorem 1). Since A\u2032 has at most O( nnz(A)d ) rows, B can be computed in O(nnz(A)(k + \u03b1\u22121)) time. However, it still has an nnz(A)\u03b1\u22121 term. So we apply our faster FD algorithm for dense matrices (Theorem 5) on A\u2032, which only takes O(nnz(A)k) + O\u0303(d\u03b1\u22123) time.\nIn order to compute a sketch C of R in step (3), we first subsample the rows of R using streaming Bernoulli sampling. One difficulty is that R could be dense, and it may take nd time to compute the norms of the rows. Fortunately, constant approximations of the norms are good enough, and thus we can use Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) (Johnson & Lindenstrauss, 1984) transform to reduce the dimensionality of R from d to O(log n). Let \u03a6 \u2208 RO(logn)\u00d7d be a JL transform, then R\u03a6T can be computed in time O(nnz(A) log n+nk log n). Now we only need to compute the norms of the rows in R\u03a6T , which are constant approximations to the row norms inR (by JL Lemma). LetQ be the\nsampled rows, with rows(Q) = O\u0303(1/\u03b12), and each row of Q can be computed in time O(kd) as Z(i)A(i) has already been computed in step (1). We finally use FD(Q,\u03b1, 0) to compute a sketch matrix C of Q in time O\u0303(d\u03b1\u22123).\nIn all, the running time is roughly O(nnz(A)(k + log n)) + O\u0303(d\u03b1\u22123 + dk\u03b1\u22122)."}, {"heading": "4.2.

To prove the first part, we only need to prove A(i)TA(i) = R(i)TR(i) +A\u2032(i)TA\u2032(i) holds for all i. Recall that A\u2032(i) = Z(i)A(i).

Then the second part follows from Lemma 2.\nLemma 4. If the entries of A are integers bounded in magnitude by poly(nd) and rank(A) \u2265 1.1k, then \u2016A \u2212 [A]k\u20162F \u2265 1/poly(nd).\nProof. The lemma directly follows from a result of (Clarkson & Woodruff, 2009), and here we use the restated version from (Boutsidis et al., 2016).\nLemma 5 (Lemma 37 of (Boutsidis et al., 2016)). If an n\u00d7 d matrix A has integer entries bounded in magnitude by \u03b3, and has rank \u03c1, then the k-th largest singular value of A satisfies\n\u03c3k \u2265 (nd\u03b32)\u2212k/2(\u03c1\u2212k).\nLemma 6. We set \u03b7 = poly\u22121(nd), then with probability at least 0.99, it holds that\n\u2016Q\u20162F = O(\u2016R\u20162F ), \u2016RTR\u2212QTQ\u20162 = O(\u03b1)\u00b7\u2016A\u2212[A]k\u20162F ,\nand rows(Q) = O(log(nd)/\u03b12).\nProof. Let us first assume rank(A) \u2265 1.1k. Each row Ri ofR is sampled with probability \u0398(\u2016Ri\u2016 2\n\u03b12F ) (by JL property), with F initialized to be \u03b7. We have \u03b7 \u2264 \u2016A\u2212 [A]k\u20162F (by Lemma 4). When \u2016R\u20162F \u2265 \u03b7, the probability is at least \u2126( \u2016Ri\u2016 2\n\u03b12\u2016R\u20162F ) (since F will be a constant approximation of \u2016R\u20162F by JL), so the first two parts directly follow from Theorem 2 and Lemma 2. Otherwise if \u2016R\u20162F \u2264 \u03b7, then the probability is \u2126(\u2016Ri\u2016 2\n\u03b12\u03b7 ) = \u2126( \u2016Ri\u20162\n\u03b12\u2016A\u2212[A]k\u20162F ) the first two\nparts follow by Theorem 2.\nTo bound the number of rows sampled, we divide the stream into epochs, where F roughly doubles in each epoch. So the total number of epochs is bounded by O(log \u2016R\u2016F\u03b7 ), as the final value of F is at most O(\u2016R\u20162F ). As we assume each\nentry of A is integer bounded in magnitude by poly(nd), which implies the number of epochs is\nO(log \u2016R\u20162F \u03b7\n) \u2264 O ( log ( \u2016A\u20162F \u00b7 poly(nd) )) = O(log(nd)).\nThe number of rows sampled in each epoch is at most O(1/\u03b12): let a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , at be the rows of R in the epoch, and thus \u2211 j \u2016aj\u20162 \u2264 O(F ) (otherwise the epoch ends); each row aj is sampled with probability \u0398( \u2016aj\u20162 \u03b12F ), which implies the total number of rows sampled is O(1/\u03b12). This proves the third part.\nThe case rank(A) \u2264 1.1k is easier: we can set the rank parameter k a little larger (say k\u2032 = 2k) in our algorithm so that R is always 0 by Lemma 2, and thus rows(Q) = 0. In this case, our algorithm is essentially exact.\nCorrectness. By union bound, with probability 0.9 all the above lemmas hold simultaneously, and we will assume this happens.

For space, we need a buffer to store a new block ofA, the size of which is at most dk+d, as the nnz(A(i)) is at most dk+ d. When applying Theorem 3, we set \u03b4 = 1/n2, and the input matrix has at most dk log(nd) rows, so we need O(dk) space to compute and store Z. A\u2032(i) is of dimension O(k)\u00d7 d, which needs O(dk) space to compute and store. To naively compute W = (I \u2212 ZTZ)A(i)\u03a6, we need O(dk + d log n) space. However,\nobserve that we do not have to compute W explicitly, we only need to know its row norms, i.e. the vector w. To save space, we compute one column of W at a time, i.e., generate columns of \u03a6 one by one, and update w iteratively, and thus the extra space used is O(d). From Theorem 5, the space used by FFDdense(A\u2032, \u03b1, k) is O(d(k + \u03b1\u22121)). Note that, in line 11 of Algorithm 5, the rows of Q(i) can be computed one by one, and thus compute C = FD(Q,\u03b1, 0) uses O(d/\u03b1) space by theorem 1. So the total space usage is bounded by O(d(k + \u03b1\u22121)).\nLet `i be the number of rows in ith block A(i). The time to compute Z using Theorem 3 is O(nnz(A(i) log n) + O\u0303(`ik\n3). Hence the total time used on this step is\u2211 i O(nnz(A(i) log n) + O\u0303(`ik 3) =\nO(nnz(A) log n) + O\u0303(nk3).\nThe step to compute the matrix multiplicationA\u2032(i) = ZA(i) takes O(nnz(A(i))k) time, since Z has O(k) rows. So the total time spent on this step is O(nnz(A)k). By the definition of blocks, there are at most O( nnz(A)dk + nk log(nd) d ) blocks. After left multiplying Z, each block contributes O(k) rows to A\u2032, and thus the total number of rows in A\u2032 is at most O( nnz(A)d + nk2 log(nd)\nd ). Computing B by invoking B = FFDdense(A\u2032, \u03b1, k) needs O(rows(A\u2032)dk) + O\u0303(d/\u03b13) = O(nnz(A)k) + O\u0303(nk3 + d/\u03b13) time. Finally, each row of Q can be computed in time O(dk) given A\u2032 (which has been computed in line 5). Invoking C = FD(Q,\u03b1, 0) needs O\u0303(d/\u03b13 + dk/\u03b12) since rows(Q) = O\u0303(1/\u03b12) by Lemma 6. The total time is thus O(nnz(A)k + nnz(A) log n) + O\u0303(nk3 + d\u03b1\u22123 + dk\u03b1\u22122)."}, {"heading": "5.
