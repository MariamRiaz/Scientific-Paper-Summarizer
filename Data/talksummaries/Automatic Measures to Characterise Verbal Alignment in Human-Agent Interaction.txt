0	31	Convergence of behaviour is an important feature of Human-Human (H-H) interaction that occurs both at low-level (e.g., body postures, accent and speech rate, word choice, repetitions) and at highlevel (e.g., mental, emotional, cognitive) (Gallois et al., 2005).
1	21	In particular, dialogue participants (DPs) automatically align their communicative behaviour at different linguistic levels including the lexical, syntactic and semantic ones (Pickering and Garrod, 2004).
2	28	A key ability in dialogue is to be able to align (or not) to show a convergent, engaged behaviour or at the opposite a divergent one.
3	20	Such convergent behaviour may facilitate successful task-oriented dialogues (Nenkova et al., 2008; Friedberg et al., 2012).
4	137	Our goal is to provide a virtual agent with the ability to detect the alignment behaviour of its human interlocutor, as well as the ability to align with the user to enhance its believability, to increase interaction naturalness and to maintain user’s engagement (Yu et al., 2016).
5	33	In this paper, we aim at providing measures characterising verbal alignment pro- cesses based on repetitions between DPs.
6	27	We propose a framework based on repetition at the lexical level which deals with textual dialogues (e.g., transcripts), along with automatic and generic measures indicating verbal alignment between interlocutors.
9	26	Section 2 presents and discusses the related work.
46	30	In this work, we define an expression as a surface text pattern at the utterance level that has been produced by both speakers in a dialogue.
61	31	In this example, “that’s not gonna work for me” is an expression initiated by A in turn 1 and established in turn 4.
68	19	The automatic extraction of expressions from a dialogue is an instance of sequential pattern mining (Mooney and Roddick, 2013) applied to textual dialogues.
81	45	Globally, we derive the following measures from the model: Expression lexicon size (ELS) the number of items in the expression lexicon, i.e. the number of established expressions in the dialogue Expression variety (EV) the expression lexicon size normalised by the total number of tokens in the dialogue.
96	20	The corpus of this study focuses on a negotiation task between two DPs and is detailed in (Gratch et al., 2016).
111	48	The order of interaction with the agents (Brad-Ellie or EllieBrad) was randomly chosen.
112	39	Half of the human participants was told they were interacting with an autonomous agent while the other half was told they were interacting with a human wizard (though the agent was always controlled by a wizard).
117	23	First, the goal in both negotiations is for the agent to win.
124	19	It shows that H-A dialogues are a bit shorter than H-H dialogues but still comparable.
127	18	This randomisation process is similar to the ones adopted by various work investigating verbal alignment (e.g., (Ward and Litman, 2007), (Healey et al., 2014), (Fusaroli and Tyln, 2016)).
137	22	Besides, we should expect more verbal alignment from the human participant than from the agent.
138	19	Indeed, the human participant both has the ability to verbally align (contrary to the agent) and may be influenced by beliefs about the communicative limitations of the agent.
189	38	Then, the human participant dedicates more tokens to the repetition of an established expression than the Woz (see Figure 1).
222	22	It turns out that some significant differences exist between the two types of negotiation (integrative and distributive) in the HA corpus.
228	18	We have presented automatic and generic measures of verbal alignment based on an expression framework focusing on repetition between DPs at the level of surface of text utterances.
230	69	The proposed measures make it possible to quantify the routinization process (via EV), the degree of repetition between DPs (via ER), and the orientation of the verbal alignment (via IES and ERS) at the level of expressions.
231	123	Besides, these measures are based on efficient algorithms (Gusfield, 1997) that make it realistic to envision an online usage in a dialogue system.
232	60	They have made it possible to check quantitatively that verbal alignment was real in both H-H and H-A task-oriented interactions (i.e. it is not likely to happen randomly).
233	20	Next, they have helped contrasting quantitatively H-H interactions from H-A interactions, showing that verbal alignment was symmetrical in H-H interactions while being asymmetrical in H-A (comforting previous hypotheses (Branigan et al., 2010)).
234	32	Finally, we have observed that H-A verbal alignment was independent of the gender of the agent (male or female) and of the framing of the experiment (human operator VS AI).
243	27	This paper has presented a framework based on expression repetition at the surface text of dialogue utterances involving automatic and computationally inexpensive measures.
244	48	These measures make it possible to quantitatively characterise the strength and orientation of verbal alignment between DPs in a task-oriented dialogue.
