3	60	Several influential factor analysis studies have shown that the three most important, largely independent, dimensions of word meaning are valence (positiveness–negativeness/pleasure– displeasure), arousal (active–passive), and dominance (dominant–submissive) (Osgood et al., 1957; Russell, 1980, 2003).1 Thus, when comparing the meanings of two words, we can compare their degrees of valence, arousal, or dominance.
5	23	Access to these degrees of valence, arousal, and dominance of words is beneficial for a number of applications, including those in natural language processing (e.g., automatic sentiment and emotion analysis of text), in cognitive science (e.g., for understanding how humans represent and use language), in psychology (e.g., for understanding how people view the world around them), in social sciences (e.g., for understanding relationships between people), and even in evolutionary linguistics (e.g., for understanding how language and behaviour inter-relate to give us an advantage).
6	30	Existing VAD lexicons (Bradley and Lang, 1999; Warriner et al., 2013) were created using rating scales and thus suffer from limitations associated with the method (Presser and Schuman, 1996; Baumgartner and Steenkamp, 2001).
8	66	In this paper, we describe how we obtained human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for more than 20,000 commonly used English words by crowdsourcing.
9	36	Notably, we use a comparative annotation technique called Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) that addresses the limitations of traditional rating scales (Louviere, 1991; Cohen, 2003; Louviere et al., 2015).
16	119	We show that even though overall the annotations are consistent (as seen from the high SHR scores), people aged over 35 are significantly more consistent in their annotations than people aged 35 or less.
18	59	We find that some personality traits significantly impact a person’s annotations of one or more of valence, arousal, and dominance.
20	30	All of the annotation tasks described in this paper were approved by our institution’s review board, which examined the methods to ensure that they were ethical.
52	38	• 520 words from the Roget’s Thesaurus categories corresponding to the eight basic Plutchik emotions.6 • About 1000 high-frequency content terms, including emoticons, from the Hashtag Emotion Corpus (HEC) (Mohammad, 2012).7 The union of the above sets resulted in 20,007 terms that were then annotated for valence, arousal, and dominance.
75	35	In the task settings for CrowdFlower, we specified that we needed annotations from six people for each word.11 However, because of the way the gold questions work in CrowdFlower, they were annotated by more than six people.
76	27	Both the minimum and the median number of annotations per item was six.
91	25	Table 5 shows the correlations between various pair-wise combinations of valence, arousal, and dominance for both our lexicon and the Warriner lexicon.
95	23	To assess this reproducibility, we calculate average split-half reliability (SHR) over 100 trials.
96	58	All annotations for an item (in our case, 4-tuples) are randomly split into two halves.
106	53	Summary of Main Results: The low correlations between the scores in our lexicon and the Warriner lexicon (especially for D and A) show that the scores in the two lexicons are substantially different.
108	71	SHR scores of 0.95 for valence, 0.9 for arousal, and 0.9 for dominance show for the first time that highly reliable fine-grained ratings can be obtained for valence, arousal, and dominance.
116	21	Understanding how different genders perceive and use language is an important component of that research.
122	67	For each demographic attribute, we partitioned the annotators into two groups: male (m) and female (f), ages 18 to 35 (≤35) and ages over 35 (>35), and so on.15 For each of the five personality traits, annotators are partitioned into the two groups shown in the bullet list of Section 4.
123	44	We then calculated the extent to which people within the same group agreed with each other, and the extent to which people across groups agreed with each other on the VAD annotations (as described in the paragraph below).
132	41	Table 7 numbers indicate that women have a higher shared understanding of the degree of arousal of words (higher f–f average agreement scores on A), whereas men have a higher shared understanding of dominance and valence of words (higher m–m average agreement scores on V and D).
148	32	However, this raises new questions: why do certain demographic attributes impact our judgments of V, A, and D?
155	28	The VAD lexicon can be used along with lists of words associated with emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, etc.
158	99	The Tweet Emotion Intensity Dataset has emotion intensity and valence scores for whole tweets (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017).
159	36	We will use the VAD lexicon to determine the extent to which high intensity and high valence tweets consist of high V, A, and D words, and to identify sentences that express high emotional intensity without using high V, A, and D words.
165	39	• To analyze interactions between demographic groups and specific groups of words, for example, whether younger annotators have a higher shared understanding of tweet terms, whether a certain gender is associated with a higher shared understanding of adjectives, etc.
172	30	(It has about 40% more words than the largest existing manually created VAD lexicon).
173	27	We used best–worst scaling to obtain finegrained scores (and word rankings) and addressed issues of annotation consistency that plague traditional rating scale methods of annotation.
176	63	We analyzed demographic information to show that even though the annotations overall lead to consistent scores in repeated annotations, there exist statistically significant differences in agreements across demographic groups such as males and females, those above the age of 35 and those that are 35 or under, and across personality dimensions (extroverts and introverts, neurotic and secure, etc.).
177	38	These results show that certain demographic attributes impact how we view the world around us in terms of the relative valence, arousal, and dominance of the concepts in it.
178	43	The NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance Lexicon is made available.17 It can be used in combination with other manually created affect lexicons such as the NRC Word–Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2013)18 and the NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon (Mohammad, 2018).19
