Linguistic alignment Linguistic alignment is the tendency to use the same or similar words as one’s conversational partner.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Alignment is an instance of a widespread and socially important human behavior: communication accommodation, the tendency of two interacting people to nonconsciously adopt similar behaviors.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[1.0],"['Alignment is an instance of a widespread and socially important human behavior: communication accommodation, the tendency of two interacting people to nonconsciously adopt similar behaviors.']"
"Evidence of accommodation appears in many behavioral dimensions, including gestures, postures, speech rate, self-disclosure, and language or dialect choice (see Giles et al. (1991) for a review).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"More accommodating people are rated by their interlocutors as more intelligible, attractive, and cooperative (Feldman, 1968; Ireland et al., 2011; Triandis, 1960).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[1.0],"['More accommodating people are rated by their interlocutors as more intelligible, attractive, and cooperative (Feldman, 1968; Ireland et al., 2011; Triandis, 1960).']"
"These perceptions have material consequences—for example, high accommodation requests are more likely to be fulfilled, and pairs who accommodate more in how they express uncertainty perform better in lab-based tasks (Buller and Aune, 1988; Fusaroli et al., 2012).

"Although accommodation is ubiquitous, individuals vary in their levels of accommodation in ways that are socially informative.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Notably, more powerful people are accommodated more strongly in many settings, including trials (Gnisci, 2005), online forums (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012), and Twitter (Doyle et al., 2016).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Most relevant for this work, speakers may increase their accommodation to signal camaraderie or decrease it to differentiate from the group.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[1.0],"['Most relevant for this work, speakers may increase their accommodation to signal camaraderie or decrease it to differentiate from the group.']"
"For example, Bourhis and Giles (1977) found that Welsh English speakers increased their use of the Welsh accent and language in response to an English speaker who dismissed it.

Person-group fit and linguistic alignment These findings suggest that linguistic alignment is a useful avenue for studying how people assimilate into a group.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[1.0],['Person-group fit and linguistic alignment These findings suggest that linguistic alignment is a useful avenue for studying how people assimilate into a group.']
"Whereas traditional approaches to studying person-group fit rely on self-reports that are subject to various forms of reporting bias and cannot feasibly be collected with high granularity across many points in time, recent studies have proposed language-based measures as a means to tracing the dynamics of person-group fit without having to rely on self-reports.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Building on Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013)’s research into language use similarities as a proxy for social distance between individuals, Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) and Goldberg et al. (2016) devel-
oped a measure of cultural fit based on the similarity in linguistic style between individuals and their colleagues in an organization.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Their timevarying measure highlights linguistic compatibility as an important facet of cultural fit and reveals distinct trajectories of enculturation for employees with different career outcomes.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While this approach can help uncover the dynamics and consequences of an individual’s fit with her colleagues in an organization, it cannot disentangle the underlying reasons for this alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For two primary reasons, it cannot distinguish between fit that arises from internalization and fit produced by self-regulation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"First, Goldberg et al. (2016) and Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) define fit using a symmetric measure, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which does not take into account the direction of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
Yet the distinction between an individual adapting to peers versus peers adapting to the individual would appear to be consequential.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Second, this prior work considers fit across a wide range of linguistic categories but does not interrogate the role of particular categories, such as pronouns, that can be especially informative about enculturation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For example, a person’s base rate use of the first-person singular (I) or plural (we) might indicate the degree of group identity internalization, whereas adjustment to we usage in response to others’ use of the pronoun might reveal the degree of self-regulation to the group’s normative expectations.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Modeling fit with WHAM To address these limitations, we build upon and extend the WHAM alignment framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016) to analyze the dynamics of internalization and selfregulation using the complete corpus of email communications and personnel records from a mid-sized technology company over a seven-year period.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM uses a conditional measure of alignment, separating overall homophily (unconditional similarity in people’s language use, driven by internalized similarity) from in-the-moment adaptation (adjusting to another’s usage, corresponding to self-regulation).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM also provides a directed measure of alignment, in that it estimates a replier’s adaptation to the other conversational participant separately from the participant’s adaptation to the replier.
Level(s) of alignment The convention within linguistic alignment research, dating back to early
work on Linguistic Style Matching (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002), is to look at lexical alignment: the repetition of the same or similar words across conversation participants.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"From a communication accommodation standpoint, this is justified by assuming that one’s choice of words represents a stylistic signal that is partially independent of the meaning one intends to express—similar to the accommodation on paralinguistic signals discussed above.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"The success of previous linguistic alignment research shows that this is valid.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"However, words are difficult to divorce from their meanings, and sometimes repeating a word conflicts with repeating its referent.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"In particular, pronouns often refer to different people depending on who uses the pronoun.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While there is evidence that one person using a first-person singular pronoun increases the likelihood that her conversation partner will as well (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007), we may also expect that one person using first-person singular pronouns may cause the other to use more second-person pronouns, so that both people are referring to the same person.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"This is especially important under the Interactive Alignment Model view (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), where conversants align their entire mental representations, which predicts both lexical and referential alignment behaviors will be observed.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Discourse-strategic explanations for alignment also predict alignment at multiple levels (Doyle and Frank, 2016).
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Since we have access to a high-quality corpus with meaningful outcome measures, we can investigate the relative importance of these two types of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We will show that referential alignment is more predictive of employment outcomes than is lexical alignment, suggesting a need for alignment research to consider both levels rather than just the latter.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We use the complete corpus of internal emails exchanged among full-time employees at a midsized US-based technology company between 2009 to 2014 (Srivastava et al., forthcoming).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
Each email was summarized as a count of word categories in its text.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"These categories are a subset of the Linguistic Information and Word Count system (Pennebaker et al., 2007).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"The categories were chosen because they are likely to be indica-
tive of one’s standing/role within a group.1
We divided email chains into message-reply pairs to investigate conditional alignment between a message and its reply.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To limit these pairs to cases where the reply was likely related to the preceding message, we removed all emails with more than one sender or recipient (including CC/BCC), identical sender and recipient, or where the sender or recipient was an automatic notification system or any other mailbox that was not specific to a single employee.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[1.0],"['To limit these pairs to cases where the reply was likely related to the preceding message, we removed all emails with more than one sender or recipient (including CC/BCC), identical sender and recipient, or where the sender or recipient was an automatic notification system or any other mailbox that was not specific to a single employee.']"
"We also excluded emails with no body text or more than 500 words in the body text, and pairs with more than a week’s latency between message and reply.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Finally, because our analyses involve enculturation dynamics over the first six months of employment, we excluded replies sent by an employee whose overall tenure was less than six months.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[1.0],"['Finally, because our analyses involve enculturation dynamics over the first six months of employment, we excluded replies sent by an employee whose overall tenure was less than six months.']"
"This resulted in a collection of 407,779 messagereply pairs, with 485 distinct replying employees.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]

Privacy protections and ethical considerations Research based on employees’ archived electronic communications in organizational settings poses potential threats to employee privacy and company confidentiality.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To address these concerns, and following established ethical guidelines for the conduct of such research (Borgatti and Molina, 2003), we implemented the following procedures: (a) raw data were stored on secure research servers behind the company’s firewall; (b) messages exchanged with individuals outside the firm were eliminated; (c) all identifying information such as email addresses was transformed into hashed identifiers, with the company retaining access to the key code linking identifying information to hashed identifiers; and (d) raw message content was transformed into linguistic categories so that identities could not be inferred from message content.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Per terms of the non-disclosure agreement we signed with the firm, we are not able to share the data underlying the analyses reported below.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"1Six pronoun categories (first singular (I), first plural (we), second (you), third singular personal (he, she), third singular impersonal (it, this), and third plural (they)) and five time/certainty categories (past tense, present tense, future tense, certainty, and tentativity).

"We can, however, share the code and dummy test data, both of which can be accessed at http: //github.com/gabedoyle/acl2017.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To assess alignment, we use the Word-Based Hierarchical Alignment Model (WHAM) framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The core principle of WHAM is that alignment is a change, usually an increase, in the frequency of using a word category in a reply when the word category was used in the preceding message.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[1.0],"['The core principle of WHAM is that alignment is a change, usually an increase, in the frequency of using a word category in a reply when the word category was used in the preceding message.']"
"For instance, a reply to the message What will we discuss at the meeting?, is likely to have more instances of future tense than a reply to the message What did we discuss at the meeting?",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Under this definition, alignment is the log-odds shift from the baseline reply frequency, the frequency of the word in a reply when the preceding message did not contain the word.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"WHAM is a hierarchical generative modeling framework, so it uses information from related observations (e.g., multiple repliers with similar demographics) to improve its robustness on sparse data (Doyle et al., 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"There are two key parameters, shown in Figure 2: ηbase, the log-odds of a given word category c when the preceding message did not contain c, and ηalign, the increase in the log-odds of c when the preceding message did contain c.
A dynamic extension To understand enculturation, we need to track changes in both the alignment and baseline over time.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"We add a month-bymonth change term to WHAM, yielding a piecewise linear model of these factors over the course of an employee’s tenure.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[1.0],"['We add a month-bymonth change term to WHAM, yielding a piecewise linear model of these factors over the course of an employee’s tenure.']"
"Each employee’s tenure is broken into two or three segments: their first six months after being hired, their last six months before leaving (if they leave), and the rest of their tenure.2 The linear segments for their alignment are fit as an intercept term ηalign, based at their first month (for the initial period) or their last month (for the final period), and per-month slopes α.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Baseline segments are fit similarly, with parameters ηbase and β.3",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To visualize the align-
2Within each segment, the employee’s alignment model is similar to that of Yurovsky et al. (2016), who introduced a constant by-month slope parameter to model changes in parent-child alignment during early linguistic development.
3The six month timeframe was chosen as previous research has found it to be a critical period for early enculturation (Bauer et al., 1998).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Pilot investigations into the change
ment behaviors and the parameter values, we create “sawhorse” plots, with an example in Figure 1.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In our present work, we are focused on changes in cultural fit during the transitions into or out of the group, so we collapse observations outside the first/last six months into a stable point estimate, constraining their slopes to be zero.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This simplification also circumvents the issue of different employees having different middle-period lengths.4
Model structure The graphical model for our instantiation of WHAM is shown in Figure 2.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For each word category c, WHAM’s generative model represents each reply as a series of tokenby-token independent draws from a binomial distribution.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The binomial probability µ is dependent on whether the preceding message did (µalign) or did not (µbase) contain a word from category c, and the inferred alignment value is the difference between these probabilities in log-odds space (ηalign).
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The specific values of these variables depend on three hierarchical features: the word category c, the group g that a given employee falls into, and the time period t (a piece of the piece-wise
in baseline usage over time showed roughly linear changes over the first/last six months, but our linearity assumption may mask interesting variation in the enculturation trajectories.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"4As shown in Figure 1, the pieces do not need to define a continuous function.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Alignment behaviors continue to change in the middle of an employee’s tenure (Srivastava et al., forthcoming), so alignment six months in to the job is unlikely to be equal to alignment six months from leaving, or the average alignment over the middle tenure.
linear function: beginning, middle, or end).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Note that the hierarchical ordering is different for the η chains and the α/β chains; c is above g and t for the η chains, but below them for the α/β chains.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This is because we expect the static (η) values for a given word category to be relatively consistent across different groups and at different times, but we expect the values to be independent across the different word categories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Conversely, we expect that the enculturation trajectories across word categories (α/β) will be similar, while the trajectories may vary substantially across different groups and different times.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Lastly, the month m in which a reply is written (measured from the start of the time period t) has a linear effect on the η value, as described below.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To estimate alignment, we first divide the replies up by group, time period, and calendar month.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We separate the replies into two sets based on whether the preceding message contained the category c (the “alignment” set) or not (the “baseline” set).,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All replies within a set are then aggregated in a single bag-of-words representation, with category token counts Calignc,g,t,m and C base c,g,t,m, and total token counts N basec,g,t,m and N base c,g,t,m comprising the observed variables on the far right of the model.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Moving from right to left, these counts are assumed to come from binomial draws with prob-
ability µalignc,g,t,m or µ base c,g,t,m. The µ values are then in turn generated from η values in log-odds space by an inverse-logit transform, similar to linear predictors in logistic regression.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The ηbase variables are representations of the baseline frequency of a marker in log-odds space, and µbase is simply a conversion of ηbase to probability space, the equivalent of an intercept term in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"ηalign is an additive value, with µalign = logit−1(ηbase + ηalign), the equivalent of a binary feature coefficient in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]

"mαc,g,t, and similarly with β for the baseline.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The remainder of the model is a hierarchy of normal distributions that integrate social structure into the analysis.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In the present work, we have three levels in the hierarchy: category, group, and time period.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In Analysis 1, employees are grouped by their employment outcome (stay, leave voluntarily, leave involuntarily); in Analyses 2 & 3, where we predict the employment outcomes, each group is a single employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The normal distributions that connect these levels have identical standard deviations σ2 = .25.5,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The hierarchies

are headed by a normal distribution centered at 0, except for the ηbase hierarchy, which has a Cauchy(0, 2.5) distribution.6
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
Message and reply length can affect alignment estimates; the WHAM model was developed in part to reduce this effect.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"As different employees had different email length distributions, we further accounted for length by dividing all replies into five quintile length bins, and treated each bin as separate observations for each employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This design choice adds an additional control factor, but results were qualitatively similar without it.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All of our analyses are based on parameter estimates from RStan fits of WHAM with 500 iterations over four chains.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"While previous research on cultural fit has emphasized either its internalization (O’Reilly et al., 1991) or self-regulation (Goldberg et al., 2016) components, our extension to the WHAM framework helps disentangle them by estimating them as separate baseline and alignment trajectories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For example, we can distinguish between an archetypal individual who initially aligns to her colleagues and then internalizes this style of communication such that her baseline use also shifts and another archetypal person who aligns to her colleagues but does not change her baseline usage.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The former exhibits high correspondence between internalization and self-regulation, whereas the latter demonstrates an ability to decouple them.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We perform three analyses on this data.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"First, we examine the qualitative behaviors of pronoun alignment and how they map onto employee outcomes in the data.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Second, we show that these qualitative differences in early enculturation are meaningful, with alignment behaviors predicting employment outcome above chance.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we consider lexical versus referential levels of alignment and show that predictions are improved under the referential formulation, suggesting that alignment is not limited to low-level wordrepetition effects.
",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"6As ηbase is the log-odds of each word in a reply being a part of the category c, it is expected to be substantially negative.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"For example, second person pronouns (you), are around 2% of the words in replies, approximately −4 in log-odds space.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
We follow Gelman et al. (2008)’s recommendation of the Cauchy prior as appropriate for parameter estimation in logistic regression.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"We begin with descriptive analyses of the behavior of pronouns, which are likely to reflect incorporation into the company.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"In particular, we look at first-person singular (I), first-person plural (we), and second-person pronouns (you).",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]

"For baselines, we see decreased use of I
and you over the first six months, with we usage increasing over the same period, confirming the expected result that incorporating into the group is accompanied by more inclusive pronoun usage.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Despite the baseline changes, alignment is fairly stable through the first six months.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Alignment on first-person singular and second-person pronouns is lower than first-person plural pronouns, likely due to the fact that I or you have different referents when used by the two conversants, while both conversants could use we to refer to the same group.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
We will consider this referential alignment in more detail in Analysis 3.,5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]

"The model estimated the initial level of baseline use (ηbase) and alignment (ηalign) for each employee, as well as the slope (α, β) for baseline and alignment over those first six months, over all 11 word categories mentioned in Section 3.

"We then created logistic regression classifiers, using the parameter estimates to predict whether an employee would leave the company.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[1.0],"['We then created logistic regression classifiers, using the parameter estimates to predict whether an employee would leave the company.']"
We fit separate classifiers for leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our results show that early alignment behaviors are better at identifying employees who will leave involuntarily than voluntarily, consistent with Srivastava et al.’s (forthcoming) findings that voluntary leavers are similar to stayers until late in their tenure.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[1.0],"['Our results show that early alignment behaviors are better at identifying employees who will leave involuntarily than voluntarily, consistent with Srivastava et al.’s (forthcoming) findings that voluntary leavers are similar to stayers until late in their tenure.']"

"For each model, we report the area under the curve (AUC).",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This value is estimated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate over different classification thresholds.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
An AUC of 0.5 represents chance performance.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We use balanced, stratified cross-
validation to reduce AUC misestimation due to unbalanced outcome frequencies and high noise (Parker et al., 2007).
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Results The left column of Figure 5 shows the results over 10 runs of 10-fold balanced logistic classifiers with stratified cross-validation in R. The alignment-based classifiers are both above chance at predicting that an employee will leave the company, whether involuntarily or voluntarily.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"The baseline-based classifiers perform worse, especially on voluntary leavers.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This finding is consistent with the idea that voluntary leavers resemble stayers (who form the bulk of the employees) until late in their tenure when their cultural fit declines.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We fit a model using both alignment and baseline parameters, but this model yielded an AUC value below the alignment-only classifier.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This suggests that where alignment and baseline behaviors are both predictive, they do not provide substantially different predictive power and lead to overfitting.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
A more sophisticated classifier may overcome these challenges; our goal here was not to achieve maximal classification performance but to test whether alignment provided any useful information about employment outcomes.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our final analysis investigates the nature of linguistic alignment: specifically, whether there is an effect of referential alignment beyond that of the more commonly used lexical alignment.
",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
Testing this hypothesis requires a small change to the alignment calculations.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"Lexical alignment is based on the conditional probability of the replier using a word category c given that the preceding message used that same category c. For referential alignment, we examine the conditional probability of the replier using a word category cj given that the preceding message used the category ci, where ci and cj are likely to be referentially linked.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"We also consider cases where ci is likely to transition to cj throughout the course of the conversation, such as present tense verbs turning into past tense as the event being described recedes into the past.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"The pairs of categories that are likely to be referentially or transitionally linked are: (you, I); (we, I); (you, we); (past, present); (present, future); and (certainty, tentativity).",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[1.0],"['The pairs of categories that are likely to be referentially or transitionally linked are: (you, I); (we, I); (you, we); (past, present); (present, future); and (certainty, tentativity).']"
"We include both directions of these pairs, so this provides approximately the same number of predictor variables for both situa-
tions to maximize comparability (12 for the referential alignments, 11 for the lexical).",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"This modification does not change the structure of the WHAM model, but rather changes its C and N counts by reclassifying replies between the baseline or alignment pathways.

Results Figure 5 plots the differences in predictive model performance using lexical versus referential alignment parameters.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[1.0],['Results Figure 5 plots the differences in predictive model performance using lexical versus referential alignment parameters.']
We find that the semantic parameters provide more accurate classification than the lexical both for voluntarily and involuntarily-leaving employees.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[1.0],['We find that the semantic parameters provide more accurate classification than the lexical both for voluntarily and involuntarily-leaving employees.']
"This suggests that while previous work looking at lexical alignment successfully captures social structure, referential alignment may reflect a deeper and more accurate representation of the social structure.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"It is unclear if this behavior holds in less formal situations or with weaker organizational structure and shared goals, but these results suggest that the traditional alignment approach of only measuring lexical alignment should be augmented with referential alignment measures for a more complete analysis.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"A key finding from this work is that pronoun usage behaviors in employees’ email communication are consistent with social integration into the group; employees use “I” pronouns less and
“we” pronouns more as they integrate.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we see the importance of using an alignment measure such as WHAM for distinguishing the base rate and alignment usage of words.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Employees who leave the company involuntarily show increased “we” usage through greater alignment, using “we” more when prompted by a colleague, but introducing it less of their own accord.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This suggests that these employees do not feel fully integrated into the group, although they are willing to identify as a part of it when a more fully-integrated group member includes them, corresponding to self-regularization over internalization.",6 Discussion,[1.0],"['This suggests that these employees do not feel fully integrated into the group, although they are willing to identify as a part of it when a more fully-integrated group member includes them, corresponding to self-regularization over internalization.']"
"The fact that these alignment measures alone, without any job productivity or performance metrics, have some predictive capability for employees’ leaving the company suggests the potential for support or intervention programs to help highperforming but poorly-integrated employees integrate into the company better.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"More generally, the prominence of pronominally-driven communication changes suggest that alignment analyses can provide insight into a range of social integration settings.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This may be especially helpful in cases where there is great pressure to integrate smoothly, and people would be likely to adopt a self-regulating approach even if they do not internalize their group membership.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Such settings not only include the high-stakes situation of keeping one’s job, but of transitioning from high school to college or moving to a new country or region.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Maximizing the chances for new members to become comfortable within a group is critical both for spreading useful aspects of the group’s existing culture to new members and for integrating new ideas from the new members’ knowledge and practices.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Alignment-based approaches can be a useful tool in separating effective interventions that cause internalization of the group dynamics from those that lead to more superficial self-regularization changes.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
This paper described an effort to use directed linguistic alignment as a measure of cultural fit within an organization.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We adapted a hierarchical alignment model from previous work to estimate fit within corporate email communications, focusing on changes in language during employees’ entry to and exit from the company.",7 Conclusions,[1.0],"['We adapted a hierarchical alignment model from previous work to estimate fit within corporate email communications, focusing on changes in language during employees’ entry to and exit from the company.']"
"Our results
showed substantial changes in the use of pronouns, with pronoun patterns varying by employees’ outcomes within the company.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
The use of the firstperson plural “we” during an employee’s first six months is particularly instructive.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Whereas stayers exhibited increased baseline use, indicating internalization, those eventually departing involuntarily were on the one hand decreasingly likely to introduce “we” into conversation, but increasingly responsive to interlocutors’ use of the pronoun.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"While not internalizing a shared identity with their peers, involuntarily departed employees were overly self-regulating in response to its invocation by others.
",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Quantitatively, rates of usage and alignment in the first six months of employment carried information about whether employees left involuntarily, pointing towards fit within the company culture early on as an indicator of eventual employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Finally, we saw ways in which the application of alignment to cultural fit might help to refine ideas about alignment itself: preliminary analysis suggested that referential, rather than lexical, alignment was more predictive of employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"More broadly, these results suggest ways that quantitative methods can be used to make precise application of concepts like “cultural fit” at scale.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]

Cultural fit is widely believed to affect the success of individuals and the groups to which they belong.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"Yet it remains an elusive, poorly measured construct.",abstractText,[0],[0]
Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"By contrast, we develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic alignment, which estimates the influence of one person’s word use on another’s and distinguishes between two enculturation mechanisms: internalization and selfregulation.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We use this measure to trace employees’ enculturation trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of individuals downstream outcomes, especially involuntary exit.",abstractText,[0],[0]
Further predictive analyses suggest referential alignment plays an overlooked role in linguistic alignment.,abstractText,[0],[0]
