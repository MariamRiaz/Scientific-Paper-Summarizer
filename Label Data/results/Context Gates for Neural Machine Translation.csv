"As science advances, scientists around the world continue to produce a large number of research articles, which provide the technological basis for worldwide dissemination of scientific discoveries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Online digital libraries such as Google Scholar, CiteSeerx, and PubMed store and index millions of such research articles and their metadata, and make it easier for researchers to search for scientific information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These libraries require effective and efficient methods for topic classification of research articles in order to facilitate the retrieval of content that is tailored to the interests of specific individuals or groups.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Supervised approaches for topic classification of research articles have been developed, which generally use either the content of the articles (Caragea et al., 2011), or take into account the citation relation between research articles (Lu and Getoor, 2003).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To be successful, these supervised approaches assume the availability of large amounts of labeled
data, which require intensive human labeling effort.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we explore a semi-supervised approach that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with small amounts of labeled data for accurate topic classification of research articles, while minimizing the human effort required for data labeling.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the scholarly domain, research articles (or papers) are highly interconnected in giant citation networks, in which papers cite or are cited by other papers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We posit that, in addition to a document’s textual content and its local neighborhood in the citation network, other information exists that has the potential to improve topic classification.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, in a citation network, information flows from one paper to another via the citation relation (Shi et al., 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This information flow and the topical influence of one paper on another are specifically captured by means of citation contexts, i.e., short text segments surrounding a citation’s mention.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These contexts are not arbitrary, but they often serve as brief summaries of a cited paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We therefore hypothesize that these micro-summaries can be successfully used as an independent view of a research article in a co-training framework to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for the task of topic classification.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The idea of using terms from citation contexts stems from the analysis of hyperlinks and the graph structure of the Web, which are instrumental in Web search (Manning et al., 2008).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Many search engines follow the intuition that the anchor text pointing to a page is a good descriptor of its content, and thus anchor text terms are used as additional index terms for a target webpage.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The use of links and anchor text was thoroughly researched for information retrieval (Koolen and Kamps, 2010), broadening a user’s search (Chakrabarti et al., 1998), query refinement (Kraft and Zien, 2004), and enriching document representations (Metzler et al., 2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Blum and
2357
Mitchell (1998) introduced the co-training algorithm using hyperlinks and anchor text as a second, independent view of the data for classifying webpages, in addition to a webpage content.

Contributions and Organization.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present a co-training approach to topic classification of research papers that effectively incorporates information from a citation network, in addition to the information contained in each paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The result of this classification task will aid indexing of documents in digital libraries, and hence, will lead to improved organization, search, retrieval, and recommendation of scientific documents.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our contributions are as follows:
• We propose the use of citation contexts as an additional view in a co-training approach, which results in high accuracy classifiers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To our knowledge, this has not been addressed in the literature.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We show experimentally that our co-training
classifiers significantly outperform: (1) supervised classifiers trained using either content or citation contexts independently, for the same fraction of labeled data; and (2) several other semi-supervised classifiers, trained on the same fractions of labeled and unlabeled data as co-training.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We also show that using the citation context
information available in citation networks, the human effort involved in data labeling for training accurate classifiers can be largely reduced.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our co-training classifiers trained on a very small sample of labeled data and a large sample of unlabeled data yield accurate topic classification of research articles.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 2, we discuss related work.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Section 3 describes our data and its characteristics, followed by the presentation of our proposed co-training approach in Section 4.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present experiments and results in Section 5, and conclude the paper and present future directions of our work in Section 6.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We discuss here the most relevant works to our study.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
A large variety of methods have been proposed in the literature with regard to automatic text classification and topic prediction.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Different classifiers have been applied on the Vector Space Model (VSM), in which a document is represented as a vector of words or phrases asso-
ciated with their TF-IDF score, i.e. term frequency - inverse document frequency (Zhang et al., 2011; Kansheng et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"VSM is the most used method due to its simple, efficient and easy to understand implementation.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Another widely used model is the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) where co-occurrences are analyzed to find semantic relationships between words or phrases (Zhang et al., 2011; Ganiz et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, a great range of classifiers were used for this task, including: Naı̈ve Bayes (Lewis and Ringuette, 1994), Knearest neighbors (Yang, 1999) and Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These techniques, however, all require a large number of labeled documents in order to build accurate classifiers.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, we propose a co-training algorithm that only requires a small amount of labeled data in order to make accurate topic classification.
Semi-supervised methods essentially involve different means of transferring labels from labeled to unlabeled samples in the process of learning a classifier that can generalize well on new unseen data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Co-training was originally introduced in (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) where it was used to classify web pages into academic course home page or not.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This approach has two views of the data as follows: the content of a web page, and the words found in the anchor text of the hyperlinks that point to the web page.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wan (2009) used co-training for cross-lingual sentiment classification of product reviews, where English and Chinese features were considered as two independent views of the data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, Gollapalli et al. (2013) used co-training to identify authors’ homepages from the current-day university websites.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The paper presents novel features, extracted from the URL of a page, that were used in conjunction with content features, forming two complementary views of the data.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Citation networks have been used before in other problems.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Caragea et al. (2014) used citation contexts to extract informative features for keyphrase extraction.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Lu and Getoor (2003) proposed an approach for document classification that used only citation links, without any textual data from the citation contexts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Ritchie et al. (2006) used a combination of terms from citation contexts and existing index terms of a paper to improve indexing of cited papers.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Citation contexts were also used to improve the performance of citation recommendation systems (Kataria et al., 2010) and to study author influence in document networks
(Kataria et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, citation contexts were used for scientific paper summarization (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011; Qazvinian et al., 2010; Qazvinian and Radev, 2008; Mei and Zhai, 2008; Lehnert et al., 1990)",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, in Qazvinian et al. (2010), a set of important keyphrases is extracted first from the citation contexts in which the paper to be summarized is cited by other papers and then the “best” subset of sentences that contain such keyphrases is returned as the summary.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Mei and Zhai (2008) used information from citation contexts to determine what sentences of a paper are of high impact (as measured by the influence of a target paper on further studies of similar or related topics).,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These sentences constitute the impact-based summary of the paper.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Despite the use of citation contexts and anchor text in many information retrieval and natural language processing tasks, to our knowledge, we are the first to propose the incorporation of citation context information available in citation networks in a co-training framework for topic classification of research papers.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The dataset used in our experiments is a subset sampled from the CiteSeerx digital library1 and labeled by Dr. Lise Getoor’s research group at the University of Maryland.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"This subset was previously used in several studies including (Lu and Getoor, 2003) and (Kataria et al., 2010).",3 Data,[0],[0]
"The dataset consists of 3186 labeled papers, with each paper being categorized into one of six classes: Agents, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) and Databases (DB).",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For each paper, we acquire the citation contexts directly from CiteSeerx.",3 Data,[0],[0]
A citation context is defined as a window of n words surrounding a citation mention.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"We differentiate between cited and citing contexts for a paper as follows: let d be a target paper and C be a citation network such that d ∈ C. A cited context for d is a context in which d is cited by some paper di in C. A citing context for d is a context in which d is citing some paper dj in C. If a paper is cited in multiple contexts within another paper, the contexts are aggregated into a single context.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For each paper in the dataset, we have at least one cited or one citing context.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"A summary of the dataset is provided in Table 1.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
"1http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/
As expected, we have a higher number of cited contexts than citing contexts.",3 Data,[0],[0]
This is due to the page restrictions often imposed to research articles that can limit the number of papers each article can cite.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, a good research paper can accumulate hundreds of citations, and hence, cited contexts over the years.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
Context lengths.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"In CiteSeerx, citation contexts have about 50 words on each side of a citation mention.",3 Data,[0],[0]
A previous study by Ritchie et al. (2008) shows that a fixed window length of about 100 words around a citation mention is generally effective for information retrieval tasks.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"For this reason, we use the contexts provided by CiteSeerx directly.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"In future, it would be interesting to study more sophisticated approaches to identifying the text that is relevant to a target citation (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2012; Teufel, 1999) and study the influence of context lengths on our task.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
"For all experiments, our labeled dataset is split in train, validation and test sets.",3 Data,[0],[0]
The validation and test sets have about 200 papers each.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"We sampled another set of papers from the labeled dataset in order to simulate the existence of unlabeled data, with a fixed size of around 2000 papers.",3 Data,[0],[0]
The remaining 786 papers are used as labeled training data.,3 Data,[0],[0]
Each experiment was repeated 10 times with 10 different random seeds and the results were averaged.,3 Data,[0],[0]
Blum and Mitchell (1998) proposed the cotraining algorithm in the context of webpage classification.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In co-training, the idea is that two classifiers trained on two different views of the data teach one another by re-training each classifier on the data enriched with predicted examples that the other classifier is most confident about.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In Blum and Mitchell (1998), webpages are represented using two different views: (1) using terms from webpages’ content and (2) using terms from the anchor text of hyperlinks pointing to these pages.

In this paper, we study the applicability and extension of the co-training algorithm to the task of topic classification of research papers, which are embedded in large citation networks.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Here, in addition to the information contained in a paper itself, citing and cited papers capture different aspects (e.g., topicality, domain of study,",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"algorithms used) about the target paper (Teufel et al., 2006), with citation contexts playing an instrumental role.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"We conjecture that citation contexts, which act as brief summaries about a cited paper, provide important clues in predicting the topicality of a target paper.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
These clues give rise to the design of our co-training based model for topic classification of research papers.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In our model, we use the content of a paper as one view and the citation contexts as another view of our data.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"In particular, for the content of a paper, we use its title and abstract as it is commonly used in the literature (Lu and Getoor, 2003); for the citation contexts, we use both the cited and citing contexts, as described in the previous section.
",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
Our co-training procedure is described in Algorithm 1.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
L and U represent the labeled and unlabeled datasets and contain instances from both views.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
The fractions of the training set are obtained from the 786 papers by selecting k% random examples from each class.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"For a round of co-training, we train classifiers C1 and C2 on the two views.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Next, s examples are sampled from the unlabeled data into S, and C1, C2 are used to obtain predictions for these s examples.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"The GetMostConfidentExamples method is a generic placeholder that stands for a function that deter-
mines what examples from S are chosen to be added into training.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Finally, at the end of an iteration, the examples left into S are moved back to U , and the algorithm iterates until there are no more unlabeled examples in U .",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
The final classifier C is obtained by combining C1 and C2 using the product of their class probability distributions.,4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"The class with the highest posterior probability (of the product of the two distributions) is chosen as the predicted class.
",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike the original co-training algorithm described by Blum and Mitchell (1998), which tackled a binary classification task (course vs. noncourse page classification), we address a multiclass classification problem, where each example (i.e., research paper) is classified into one of six different classes.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Moreover, in Blum and Mitchell (1998), the co-training algorithm moves p highest confidence positive examples and n highest confidence negative examples from S to L, where p : n represents the class distribution in the original labeled training set (i.e., if there are 10 positive examples and 90 negative examples in the labeled set L, then p = 1 positive and n = 9 negative examples are moved to the labeled set at each iteration of co-training).",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike, this approach that preserves the class distribution of the original labeled training set, we move into L all examples that are classified with a confidence above a certain threshold.",4 Co-Training for Topic Classification,[0],[0]
"First, the proposed method is evaluated on the validation set.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We first compare it against various supervised and semi-supervised baselines.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Next, we report the performance of our co-training algorithm under different scenarios, where either cited or citing contexts are used.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We also show the most informative words for each classifier.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Finally, with the best parameters obtained on the validation set, we report the precision, recall and F1-score, obtained by each method, on the test set.
",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In experiments, the sample size ‘s’ from Algorithm 1 is set to 300, i.e. the number of documents sampled from the unlabeled pool at each iteration; the confidence threshold is set to 0.95, i.e. if both classifiers agree on the class label and have a confidence ≥ 0.95, the instance is labeled and moved into the labeled training set.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"These parameters are estimated on the validation set, but the results are not shown due to space limitation.
",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
Evaluation Measures.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We report results averaged over ten different runs with random splits.,5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"For each random split, we return the weighted average precision, recall and F1-score.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In all the experiments, we use the Naı̈ve Bayes Multinomial classifier and its Weka implementation2, with term-frequencies as feature values.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"We experimented with both TF and TF-IDF scores, using different classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Naı̈ve Bayes Multinomial, and simple Naı̈ve Bayes classifiers), but Naive Bayes Multinomial with TF performed best.",5 Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
How does co-training compare with supervised learning techniques?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we compare our co-training method with two supervised baselines: (1) when only document content is used and (2) when only citation contexts are used.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 1 shows the F1-scores achieved using different initial training sizes.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"We can see that overall, the citation contexts are better at predicting the topic of a document compared with the content, outperforming them in 9 out of 10 experimental settings.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The only exception to this trend is when a small number (5%) of training instances is available, in which case the supervised content view performs better, reaching an F1-score of 0.534.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Regardless, the co-training method shows significant improvement over both baselines, in all experiments.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Starting with an F1-score of 0.572, it continues to improve its performance as the training percentage is increasing.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The maximum F1score, i.e. 0.742, is reached when 30% of the labeled training set is used.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Note that the difference in performance between co-training and the two supervised baselines is statistically significant for
2http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
A fully supervised baseline that uses 100% of the training set achieves an F1-score of 0.720 (using content) and 0.738 (using citation contexts).,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In contrast, co-training requires only 15% of the labeled training set to outperform the fully supervised content baseline and 30% of the training set to outperform the fully supervised citation contexts baseline.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Consequently, using a co-training approach that includes citation contexts as well as the document content can not only increase the performance, but will also significantly reduce the need of expensive labeled instances.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 illustrates the confusion matrices of three experiments: (a) supervised content view, i.e. the title and abstract, (b) supervised citation contexts view, and (c) co-training that uses both views.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
These experiments use 10% of the training set.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Each of the matrices are represented by a heat map, i.e. the redder the color, the higher the value assigned to that position.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
An accuracy of 1 will be represented by a matrix with red blocks on the main diagonal and white blocks everywhere else.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"This experiment was performed 10 times with 10 different seeds and the results have been averaged.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, the matrix that uses only titles and abstracts, i.e. left side, is showing the highest percentage of misclassified documents, classifying correctly about 58.8% instances, on average.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Using only citation contexts in a supervised framework, i.e. center matrix, we reach a higher accuracy of 60.7%.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The co-training method, which uses the content of the paper and citations as two independent views, significantly increases the average accuracy to 67.3%.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
This experiment shows that citation contexts are better than titles and abstracts at predicting the topic of a document.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, our proposed approach, which uses the content of the paper as well as citation contexts, achieves higher results than each view used separately.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The difference in accuracy is statistically significant across all three experiments for a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Overall, the Agents class seem to be the easiest to classify, reaching an accuracy value of 91.6% when using co-training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the AI class is the hardest to classify.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
One reason for this is that the AI class contains the lowest number of instances in the dataset.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Another can be that the AI class is the most general among all classes and therefore, classifying documents with this la-
Left: using titles and abstracts; Center: using citation contexts;",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Right: using co-training.
bel can be a difficult task even for a human.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Other common misclassifications occur between classes like HCI and Agents, ML and IR or AI and ML, due to their similarity.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
How does our co-training method compare with other supervised approaches?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we compare the performance of co-training against two other methods: early and late fusion.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In early fusion, the feature vectors of the two views are concatenated, creating a single representation of the data.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In contrast, late fusion trains two separate classifiers and then combines them by taking the label with the highest confidence.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows this comparison over different training sizes.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The results show that the cotraining method is more accurate than all others, performing best in all 10 experimental settings.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Late fusion has an overall lower performance compared with co-training, but is in a tight correlation with it.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, early fusion achieves the lowest F1-score across the experiments.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The reported results are statistically significant at p value of 0.05, when the training percentage is between 5 and 35.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we can say that train-
ing two separate classifiers, one of each view, yields higher performance compared with training a single classifier that incorporates both views.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Moreover, using a co-training approach that incorporates information from unlabeled data into the model, will help the two classifiers increase their confidences and minimize the error rate.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
How does co-training compare with semisupervised methods?,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Here, we present results comparing co-training with two other wellknown semi-supervised techniques: self-training and Naı̈ve Bayes with Expectation Maximization.
Self-Training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"First, we show results of the comparison of co-training with two variations of selftraining: (1) self-training using only document content, and (2) self-training using only citation contexts.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Figure 4 shows the results of this experiment.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Self-training is similar to co-training, except that it uses only one view of the data (Zhu, 2005).",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Self-training parameters, e.g., sample size ‘s’ or number of iterations, are estimated as in cotraining.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Although the document content version of selftraining outperforms co-training when using 5%
of the training instances, we can see that overall, there is a significant difference in terms of F1score values in the favor of co-training.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"In 9 out of 10 experiments, our co-training approach is superior to both self-training methods.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The results are statistically significant across all experimental setups for a p value of 0.05.
",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Expectation Maximization.,5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Figure 5 shows the F1-score values obtained after running NBM with EM with the same training, unlabeled and test sets.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"The EM algorithm uses the same classifier, i.e. NBM, and the weight for each unlabeled instance is set to 1, as this setting achieved the highest results.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Two different experiments were performed using EM: (1) using only document content, and (2) using only citation contexts.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in the figure, overall, the co-training approach significantly outperforms both variations of EM.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"However, the co-training method falls short when using 5% of the training instances, where EM Content and EM Citations methods are achieving higher F1-score values.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Nonetheless, both EM variations tend to achieve an F1-score value below or equal to 0.710, whereas co-training reaches performance values of 0.74 or higher.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
"Again, the comparison results between co-training and both variations of EM are statistically significant for training sizes between 10% and 50%, for a p value of 0.05.",5.1 Baseline Comparisons,[0],[0]
Which of the two types of citation contexts (cited or citing) help the task of topic classification more and how does co-training perform in the absence of either one?,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
The answer to this question is important as there are cases in which citation contexts are not readily available.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"One frequently encountered example includes newly published research papers that have no cited contexts.
",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"In this case, it is important to know how our method performs when we only have one type of citation contexts.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"Figure 6 shows the difference in performance when using: (1) only cited contexts, (2) only citing contexts, and (3) both context types.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"Note that the content view remains the same across all three experiments.
",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
The plot is showing that citing contexts are bringing in a significantly higher margin of knowledge compared with cited contexts.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"This is consistent over different training set sizes, as shown in the figure, with a more prominent impact when a small training size is used, i.e. 5-30%.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"The fact that the citing contexts achieve higher F1-score than cited contexts is consistent with the intuition that when citing a paper y, an author generally summarizes the main ideas from y using important words from a target paper x, making the citing contexts to have higher overlap with words from x.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
"In turn, a paper z that cites x may use paraphrasing to summarize ideas from x with words more similar to those from the content of z.
When the two types of contexts are used, cotraining achieves higher results compared with cases when only one context type is used.",5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
This experiment shows that our method can be applied for both old and new research articles.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
Citing contexts will be available in the text of the target paper and are independent of the existence of the cited contexts.,5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types,[0],[0]
What are the most informative words from each view: document content and citation contexts?,5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
Figure 7 shows the words from each view that are most useful for our topic classification task.,5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"The larger the word, the more informative is for our
task.",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"To determine the informativeness of a word, we used its Information Gain score.",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"For these experiments, we used training sets consisting of 30% of the instances, setting in which we achieved the best results on the validation and test sets using our proposed co-training approach.
",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, the two word clouds have a high word overlap.",5.3 Informative Features,[0],[0]

"In this paper, we focus on full information games in which it is assumed that the feedback supplied at trial t by the environment is the entire vector `t. On the other hand, we make very few assumptions about the decision set: S may be described by an arbitrary SAT formula, that is, any set of combinatorial constraints representable by Boolean clauses.",1.

"As SAT encodings of discrete solution spaces are frequently used in academic and industrial applications (Biere et al., 2009), our setting covers an important class of combinatorial prediction games.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As usual, the performance of an online learning algorithm is measured according to two metrics.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The first, called regret, measures the difference in cumulative loss between the algorithm and the best solution in hindsight.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this study, we make no assumption about the sequence of loss vectors; in particular `t may depend on the previous decisions s1, · · · , st−1 made by the learner.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Related Work.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the literature of combinatorial prediction games, three main strategies have been proposed to attain an expected regret that is sublinear in the game horizon T and polynomial in the input dimension d. The
first, and arguably simplest strategy, is to Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL): on each trial t, the learner draws at random a perturbation vector zt ∈ Rd, and then selects in S a minimizer of ηLt + zt, where η ∈ (0, 1] is a step-size parameter, andLt is the cumulative lossLt = `1 + · · ·+`t−1.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Based on the pioneering work of Hannan (1957), refined in (Hutter & Poland, 2005; Kalai & Vempala, 2005), the FPL algorithm achieves an expected regret of O(d 32 √ T ).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The second strategy is based on the popular exponentially weighted average forecaster in the framework of prediction with expert advice (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The overall idea is to maintain a weight for each feasible solution s ∈ S, which decays exponentially according to the estimated cumulative loss of s. Specifically, on each trial t, the learner draws a solution st ∈ S at random from the exponential family pt(s) ∼ exp(−η〈Lt, s〉).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This strategy, referred to as Expanded Hedge (EH) in (Koolen et al., 2010), attains an expected regret of O(d 32 √ T ).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, the third strategy is to Follow the Regularized Leader, a paradigm often advocated in online convex optimization (Hazan, 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here, the learner operates on the convex hull of S, denoted conv(S).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"On each trial t, the learner starts by choosing a point pt ∈ conv(S) that minimizes η〈L̂t,p〉 + F (p), where F is a regularization function.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Next, pt is decomposed as a convex composition of feasible solutions in S, and then, a decision st is picked at random according to the resulting distribution.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For modular loss functions, this strategy is equivalent to the Online Stochastic Mirror Descent (OSMD) algorithm (Audibert et al., 2014; Rajkumar & Agarwal, 2014), which iteratively performs a gradient descent in the dual space of conv(S) under F , and projects back to the primal space according to the Bregman divergence defined from F .",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Notably, when F is the Euclidean regularizer, OSMD coincides with the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm (Robbins & Monro, 1951).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, when F is the entropic regularizer, OSMD corresponds to the Component Hedge (CH) algorithm (Koolen et al., 2010), which achieves an optimal expected regret of O(d √ T ).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"From the viewpoint of regret, the results outlined above indicate that few improvements remain to be made in full information games.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, we get a different picture if computational considerations are taken into account: all aforementioned algorithms rely on powerful oracles for making decisions in spaces S represented by combinatorial constraints.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Namely, the EH algorithm is required, at each iteration, to sample a solution according to an exponential family over S , a problem which is generally #P-hard (Dyer et al., 2009).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Similarly, the FPL strategy has to repeatedly solve a linear optimization task over S, which is generally NP-hard (Creignou et al., 2001).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the OSMD algorithm, and its specializations SGD and CH, the computational issue
is exacerbated by the fact that, even if the learner has access to a linear optimization oracle, it still has to perform, at each trial, a Bregman projection step for which the best known algorithms run in O(d6) time (Suehiro et al., 2012).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although combinatorial prediction games are generally intractable, efficient implementations of sampling and optimization oracles may be obtained for several decision sets S. For example, when the feasible solutions in S coincide with the bases of a binary matroid, or the perfect matchings of a bipartite graph, linear optimization can be performed in polynomial time, and tractable forms of FPL and OSMD may be derived (Helmbold & Warmuth, 2009; Koolen et al., 2010; Takimoto & Hatano, 2013; Rajkumar & Agarwal, 2014).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, when the feasible solutions in S correspond to the paths or multi-paths of a rooted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), the sampling oracle may be implemented by the weight pushing technique (Mohri, 1998), that recursively evaluates the partition function of an exponential family over the edges of the input DAG.",1.

"With these compilation tools in hand, our contributions are threefold: (i) we show that for dDNNF circuits, the sampling oracle in EH and the linear optimization oracle in FPL, run in linear time using a simple variant of the weight-
pushing technique; (ii) for the SGD and CH strategies, we develop a Bregman projection-decomposition method that uses O(d2 ln(dT ))",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"In both environments, the agent’s observation consists of a bag of words, where the words correspond to (feature, location).",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"Features consist of item types, names, and their other properties.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"The locations include position relative to the agent in the maze, and also a few special slots for inventory, current, and target attributes.
",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
Training proceeds according to Algorithm 1.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"During the explore phase, an exploratory policy is trained with reinforcement learning using a count-based reward proportional
to c⇡e(⇢i, ⇢j)P",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"i,j c⇡e(⇢i, ⇢j) + 0.001 !",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"0.5
for making a transition (⇢i, ⇢j), where c⇡e(⇢i, ⇢j) is the number of times transition (⇢i, ⇢j) has been seen so far.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"We discuss this exploration bonus in Appendix A.
During the final phase of training we simultaneously compute ⇡ and c⇡ , so we use an exponentially decaying average of the success rate of ⇡ to deal with it’s nonstationarity:
c⇡(⇢i, ⇢j) =
PT t=1
T tSt⇡(⇢i, ⇢j)PT t=1 T tAt⇡(⇢i, ⇢j) ,
where T is the number of training epochs, At⇡ is the number of attempted transitions (⇢i, ⇢j) during epoch t, and St⇡ is the number of successful transitions.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
A decay rate of = 0.9 is used.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"More details of the model and training are provided in Appendix C.
In the switches environment, multi-step test tasks are generated by setting a random attribute as target, which can require up to 12 attribute transitions.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"In the crafting environment, test tasks are generated by randomly selecting a (crafted) item as a target.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"Since we do not care about other items in the inventory, the target state is underspecified.
",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
We produce a curriculum baseline by gradually increase the upper bound on the difficulty of tasks during training.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"In the switches environment, the difficulty corresponds to the number of toggles necessary for solving the task.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"The craft environment has two levels of difficulty: tasks can be completed by a single grab or craft action, and tasks that require multiple such actions.
",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
Table 3 compares our Attribute Planner (AP) to a reinforcement learning baseline on the mazebase tasks.,4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"The AP planning outperforms purely reactive training regardless of whether one-step, multi-step, or a curriculum of training examples is provided.",4.2. Grid Worlds,[0],[0]
"Finally, we test our approach for planning a build order in StarCraft: Brood War (Synnaeve et al., 2016).",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"We consider the space of tasks of building particular units in a fixed time of 500 steps, e.g. “build 1 barracks and 2 marines“.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"This task is challenging for RL because the agent must complete a number of distinct steps, e.g. mine enough ore, then build a barracks, and finally train marines using the barracks, before receiving a reward.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Each of these steps requires the agent have to control multiple units of different types using low-level actions similar to how a human plays the game.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"See Appendix D for more details.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"As in (Sukhbaatar et al., 2017), we restrict the game to the Terran race and only allow construction of certain units.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"In the small version, the agent can mine ore and build SCVs, supply depots, barracks, and marines.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"In the large version, an engineering bay and missile turrets are included as well.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"The attributes are chosen to be the number of units and resources of each type, specifically
{min(bNore/25c, 40), NSCV , Ndepot, Nbarracks, Nmarine}
where Nx is the number of x present in the game, including units under construction.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"The large version also include {Neng.bay, Nturrets}.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Models are trained for a total of 30 million steps.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
AP uses 16 million steps for exploration and 14 million steps for training ⇡.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"Table 4 shows the final performance of the AP model and reactive RL baselines on this task after 30 million steps of training.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"AP exploration finds 120,000 and 420,000 edges for the small and large versions, respectively.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
The size and scaling of this graph show the limitations of a fully explicit graph.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"In fact, we represent the ore attribute as bNore/25c because it decreases the size of the graph by a factor of 25: otherwise for each transition w.r.t.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"the other attributes, the graph would have a separate edge for each valid value of total ore.
",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Count-based exploration over attributes is vital during the Explore phase in StarCraft.,4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
"If a random policy is used in the small version, only 2047 edges are discovered as opposed to 120,000 using count-based exploration, and the final performance is reduced from 31.7% to 6.4%.",4.3. StarCraft,[0],[0]
Our results show that structuring the space of tasks with high level attributes allows an agent to compose policies for simple tasks into solutions of more complex tasks.,5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"The agent plans a path to the final goal at the level of the attributes, and executes the steps in this path with a reactive policy.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Thus, supervision of an agent by labeling attributes can lead to generalization from simple tasks at train time to more complex tasks at test time.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"There are several fronts for further work:
Sample complexity of the planning module: In Table 2 we can see both the benefits and the liabilities of the explicit non-parametric form for c⇡ .",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"By 10K samples, the parametric lower level policy is already able to have a reasonable success rate.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, because in this environment, there are over 200K edges in the graph, most of the edges have not been seen, and without any weight-sharing, our model cannot estimate these transition probabilities.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, by 100K samples the model has seen enough of the graph to make nontrivial plans; and the non-parametric form of the graph makes planning straightforward.
",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"In future work, we hope to combine parametric models for c⇡ with search to increase the sample efficiency of the planning module.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, we might hope to make progress on dynamic abstraction (projecting out some of the attributes) depending on the current state and goal, which would make the effective number of edges of the graph smaller.
",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Exploration We have shown that the attributes ⇢ and counts c⇡, in addition to their usefulness for planning, provide a framework for incentivizing exploration.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"In this work we considered a simple count-based exploration strategy, which achieved better exploration in attribute space than random exploration.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, this setting of pure exploration where there are no empirical rewards is different from the classic problem of exploration in an MDP, and warrants further exploration (see Appendix A).
",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
Learning the attributes: Discovering the attributes automatically would remove much of the need for human supervision.,5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Recent work, such as (Thomas et al., 2017), demonstrates how this could be done.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Another avenue for discovering attributes is to use a few “seed” attributes, which is necessary for task specification anyway, and use aliasing as a signal that some attributes need to be refined.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
The tasks that an agent will need to solve often are not known during training.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"However, if the agent knows which properties of the environment are important then, after learning how its actions affect those properties, it may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifically for them.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Towards this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We propose a method that learns a policy for transitioning between “nearby” sets of attributes, and maintains a graph of possible transitions.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We show in 3D block stacking, gridworld games, and StarCraft that our model is able to generalize to longer, more complex tasks at test time by composing simpler learned policies.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"Clustering is one of the most widely used techniques in data analysis (Xu & Wunsch, 2005; Jain, 2010).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite a rich literature on pure continuous data or pure categorical data, the clustering problem remains challenging for mixed-type data, i.e., data with both types of attributes (Everitt et al., 2001).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Mixed-type data are ubiquitous in real world domains, e.g., social science, biomedicine and finance, where categorical attributes often describe demographic information or questionnaire responses, and continuous attributes often correspond to quantitative measurements.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, only a very limited number of clustering methods have been proposed for such data (Everitt et al., 2001; Huang, 1998).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The major challenge is the lack of a good geometric intuition of data on the mixed-type domain;

"such intuition is the important basis of many successful geometric clustering methods, e.g., k-means (MacQueen et al., 1967), Ward’s method (Ward Jr, 1963), DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996), to name a few.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In practice, what usually being done is to convert mixed-type data to either pure continuous or pure categorical domain, and subsequently use existing geometric clustering methods.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A metric for directly dealing with mixed-type data is also available, based on Gower’s coefficient (1971).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The uptake of geometric clustering methods is mostly driven by their lightweight computational requirements.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, these methods lack a well justified underlying probabilistic model, are sensitive to the choice of underlying metric, and do not give a principled answer to the fundamental question of required number of clusters for the data at hand.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose a probabilistic clustering method for mixed-type data, which admits at least four attractive properties.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, our probabilistic method goes beyond the widely-adopted class conditional independence assumption of feature variables, e.g., as in the latent class model (McCutcheon, 1987).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, our method is based on the global topographical features, i.e., peaks and mountains, of the density function, rather than the distances between data points.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The argument for topographical features is to sidestep a premature specification of the metric space in which our mixed-type data will achieve the best grouping.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third, our method is able to utilize a persistent homology theory to automatically determine the number of clusters in the data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Fourth, the proposed method can be easily parallelized to achieve a competitive running time with respect to many lightweight geometric clustering methods.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"From the modeling perspective, we compose tree graphical models with topographical features to achieve a probabilistic mixed-type clustering model.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Graphical models provide a way of factorizing a joint probability distribution into a product of local interactions.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
These local interactions capture dependency among feature variables.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
While a Bayesian network or a Markov random field can be built with a set of nodes representing each feature variable.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The graph structure and parameter estimation can be computationally expensive.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"By constraining the graph to be a tree, the structure and parameter can be learned efficiently.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Other than computational benefits, tree-structured
graphical models also provide a modeling elegance; with a tree structure, we have a factorization that explicitly corresponds to empirical univariate and bivariate marginal distributions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the bivariate distributions, we can then adapt the product kernel density estimation (Scott, 2015) to capture interaction between continuous-continuous variables, between categorical-categorical variables, and between categorical-continuous variables.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Having modeled the data generation process via a tree graphical model, we are left with finding a robust approach for assigning each data point to its cluster.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To achieve this, we adopt a topological perspective, namely, we view a probability distribution as a terrain function, called the density landscape, and capture its topographical features as the basis for defining clusters.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The topographical features include modes (peaks) and their attractive basins.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For high-dimension and sparse data, it is natural to have many modes.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To avoid over-segmentation of the data and generation of many clusters with only few members, we employ a persistent homology theory (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010) to measure the saliency of all modes and merge the trivial ones.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our principled method for clustering mixed-type data respects the underlying topographical features of the density landscape and achieves competitive performance on real data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Clustering has been extensively studied in machine learning and data mining.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Many comprehensive surveys have been produced detailing the landscape of clustering problems and models.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Here we will review related work in the context of geometric versus probabilistic clustering methods for mixed-type data and clustering methods that rely on topographical features such as modes and their attractive basins.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Geometric clustering methods A straightforward approach for mixed-type data clustering is to map them into either pure continuous or pure categorical domains before applying a standard clustering method.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"A metric based on Gower’s coefficient (Gower, 1971) has been proposed for mixed-type data, which rescales the difference in all dimensions, continuous or categorical, and take the average.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
One can apply any distance based method using these metrics.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, all these methods are heuristic; there is no good justification for the underlying geometric intuition of these methods on such a counter-intuitive metric space, despite some successful stories in practice.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, K-Prototypes algorithm (Huang, 1998) uses a weighted sum of the Euclidean distance and Hamming distance and adopts the K-Means method (Faber, 1994), which iteratively finds the mean of each cluster and re-associates data to different clusters.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"When the data is pure categorical, the method is called K-Modes (Huang, 1997).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Chiu et al. (2001) proposed a hierarchical clustering method, in
which distance between clusters are measured using their log-likelihood, which treat continuous and categorical domain separately.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Probabilistic clustering methods Graphical models have been applied to clustering before.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Zhang (2004) proposed a latent tree model, i.e., a Bayesian tree whose leaf nodes correspond to all observed dimensions and internal nodes are latent variables determining different clusters.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Such tree structure can be learned using efficient algorithms (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, this method is only restricted to categorical data.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Lee & Hastie (2015) proposed a loopy graphical model to model mixed-type data.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their model reduces to a discrete Markov random field when all attributes are categorical, and a Gaussian graphical model when all attributes are continuous.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Parameters are learned using pseudo-likelihood estimation (Besag, 1975) and edges are selected using group sparsity penalties (Yuan & Lin, 2006; Huang & Zhang, 2010).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, an efficient inference model is missing in order to apply such model to clustering.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Clustering by mode-seeking The density landscape has been exploited before to extract global properties of the data and to achieve better clustering quality.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Mode-seeking methods, i.e., associating data to modes representing clusters, have been proposed before in continuous domain (Cheng, 1995; Comaniciu & Meer, 2002b).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"But such methods rely on a kernel density estimation, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality and thus do not scale to high dimensions (Wasserman, 2013, chap. 20).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Chen & Quadrianto (2016) proposed a mode-seeking method for categorical data clustering.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, their method tends to produce trivial modes/clusters and thus over-segments the data, mainly due to the lack a principled way to merge modes into clusters of proper size.
",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Persistent homology for merging clusters In recent years, novel approaches have been proposed to merge modes/clusters based on the topographical landscape of the density function.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Chazal et al. (2013) used topological persistence to guide the merging of data into clusters.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their method, although theoretically sound, relies on a k-nearest neighbor graph of the data and a given density function, e.g., a kernel density estimation (Silverman, 1986) or a distance from measure (Chazal et al., 2011).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
This method assumes that the data is a high quality sample of the domain and the k-nearest neighbor graph faithfully captures the topographical characteristics of the distribution.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, this condition is often too strong to assume in practice, where most datasets are relatively sparse.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose to start with mode-seeking, and leverage these modes and the gradient paths as a more accurate account of the density landscape.",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
Our idea proves to be a better solution and a good complement to the theoretical tool.,1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]
"We also refer to other topological and geometrical studies into the
global structures of hierarchical clustering (Eldridge et al., 2015; Carlsson & Mémoli, 2010).",1.1. Related Work,[0],[0]

Our RBCML framework leverages the strengths of rank breaking and CML.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The major advantage of CML is that often marginal likelihood functions are much easier to optimize than the full likeli-
hood function.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, for RUMs, even computing the marginal likelihood may take too much time, as CML needs to count the number of pairwise comparisons between alternatives in the rankings, which takes O(m2n) time, where m is the number of alternatives and n is the number of rankings.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, standard CML becomes inefficient when m or n are large.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
RBCML overcomes such inefficiency by applying rank-breaking.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"The lexicographic approach can capture finer-grained meaning distinctions, at a risk of relying upon idiosyncratic and potentially incomplete dictionary definitions.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"The semantic class approach, which we follow here, focuses on commonalities in meaning across multiple lexical items, and aims to general-
2Of course, meanings marked by prepositions/possessives are to some extent captured in predicate-argument or graphbased meaning representations (e.g., Palmer et al., 2005; Fillmore and Baker, 2009; Oepen et al., 2016; Banarescu et al., 2013) and domain-centric representations like TimeML and ISO-Space (Pustejovsky et al., 2003, 2012).
ize more easily to new types and usages.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"The most recent class-based approach to prepositions was our initial framework of 75 preposition supersenses arranged in a multiple inheritance taxonomy (Schneider et al., 2015, 2016).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"It was based largely on relation/role inventories of Srikumar and Roth (2013) and VerbNet (Bonial et al., 2011; Palmer et al., 2017).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"The framework was realized in version 3.0 of our comprehensively annotated corpus, STREUSLE3 (Schneider et al., 2016).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"However, several limitations of our approach became clear to us over time.
",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"First, as pointed out by Hwang et al. (2017), the one-label-per-token assumption in STREUSLE is flawed because it in some cases puts into conflict the semantic role of the PP with respect to a predicate, and the lexical semantics of the preposition itself.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Hwang et al. (2017) suggested a solution, discussed in §3.3, but did not conduct an annotation study or release a corpus to establish its feasibility empirically.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"We address that gap here.
",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Second, 75 categories is an unwieldy number for both annotators and disambiguation systems.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Some are quite specialized and extremely rare in STREUSLE 3.0, which causes data sparseness issues for supervised learning.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"In fact, the only published disambiguation system for preposition supersenses collapsed the distinctions to just 12 labels (Gonen and Goldberg, 2016).",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
Hwang et al. (2017) remarked that solving the aforementioned problem could remove the need for many of the specialized categories and make the taxonomy more tractable for annotators and systems.,2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"We substantiate this here, defining a new hierarchy with just 50 categories (SNACS, §3) and providing disambiguation results for the full set of distinctions.
",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Finally, given the semantic overlap of possessive case and the preposition of, we saw an opportunity to broaden the application of the scheme to include possessives.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Our reannotated corpus, STREUSLE 4.0, thus has supersense annotations for over 1000 possessive tokens that were not semantically annotated in version 3.0.",2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
We include these in our annotation and disambiguation experiments alongside reannotated preposition tokens.,2 Background: Disambiguation of Prepositions and Possessives,[0],[0]
"Apart from canonical prepositions and possessives, there are many lexically and semantically overlap-
3https://github.com/nert-gu/streusle/
ping closed-class items which are sometimes classified as other parts of speech, such as adverbs, particles, and subordinating conjunctions.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002) argues for an expansive definition of ‘preposition’ that would encompass these other categories.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"As a practical measure, we decided to encourage annotators to focus on the semantics of these functional items rather than their syntax, so we take an inclusive stance.
",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
Another consideration is developing annotation guidelines that can be adapted for other languages.,3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"This includes languages which have postpositions, circumpositions, or inpositions rather than prepositions; the general term for such items is adpositions.4 English possessive marking (via ’s or possessive pronouns like my) is more generally an example of case marking.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"Note that prepositions (4a–4c) differ in word order from possessives (4d), though semantically the object of the preposition and the possessive nominal pattern together:
(4) a. eat in a restaurant b. the man in a blue shirt c. the wife of the ambassador d. the ambassador’s wife
Cross-linguistically, adpositions and case marking are closely related, and in general both grammatical strategies can express similar kinds of semantic relations.",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"This motivates a common semantic inventory for adpositions and case.
",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"We also cover multiword prepositions (e.g., out_of, in_front_of), intransitive particles (He flew away), purpose infinitive clauses (Open the door to let in some air5), prepositions with clausal complements (It rained before the party started), and idiomatic prepositional phrases (at_large).",3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
Our annotation guidelines give further details.,3.1 Lexical Categories of Interest,[0],[0]
"The hierarchy of preposition and possessive supersenses, which we call Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses (SNACS), is shown in figure 2.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"It is simpler than its predecessor— Schneider et al.’s (2016) preposition supersense hierarchy—in both size and structural complexity.

"Counts are of direct uses of labels, excluding uses of subcategories.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Role and function positions are not distinguished (so if a token has different role and function labels, it will count toward two supersense frequencies).
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
SNACS has 50 supersenses at 4 levels of depth; the previous hierarchy had 75 supersenses at 7 levels.,3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"The top-level categories are the same:
• CIRCUMSTANCE:",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Circumstantial information, usually non-core properties of events (e.g., location, time, means, purpose) •",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
PARTICIPANT: Entity playing a role in an event • CONFIGURATION:,3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Thing, usually an entity or property, involved in a static relationship to some other entity The 3 subtrees loosely parallel adverbial adjuncts, event arguments, and adnominal complements, respectively.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"The PARTICIPANT and CIRCUMSTANCE subtrees primarily reflect semantic relationships prototypical to verbal arguments/adjuncts and were inspired by VerbNet’s thematic role hierarchy (Palmer et al., 2017; Bonial et al., 2011).",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Many CIRCUMSTANCE subtypes, like LOCUS (the concrete or abstract location of something), can be governed by eventive and non-eventive nominals as well as verbs: eat in the restaurant, a party in the restaurant, a table in the restaurant.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"CONFIGURATION mainly encompasses non-spatiotemporal relations holding between entities, such as quantity, possession, and part/whole.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Unlike the previous hierarchy, SNACS does not use multiple inheritance, so there is no overlap between the 3 regions.
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"The supersenses can be understood as roles in fundamental types of scenes (or schemas) such as: LOCATION—THEME is located at LO-
CUS; MOTION—THEME moves from SOURCE along PATH to GOAL; TRANSITIVE ACTION— AGENT acts on THEME, perhaps using an INSTRUMENT;",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"POSSESSION—POSSESSION belongs to POSSESSOR; TRANSFER—THEME changes possession from ORIGINATOR to RECIPIENT, perhaps with COST;",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"PERCEPTION—EXPERIENCER is mentally affected by STIMULUS; COGNITION— EXPERIENCER contemplates TOPIC; COMMUNICATION—information (TOPIC) flows from ORIGINATOR to RECIPIENT, perhaps via an INSTRUMENT.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"For AGENT, CO-AGENT, EXPERIENCER, ORIGINATOR, RECIPIENT, BENEFICIARY, POSSESSOR, and SOCIALREL, the object of the preposition is prototypically animate.
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Because prepositions and possessives cover a vast swath of semantic space, limiting ourselves to 50 categories means we need to address a great many nonprototypical, borderline, and special cases.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"We have done so in a 75-page annotation manual with over 400 example sentences (Schneider et al., 2018).
",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"Finally, we note that the Universal Semantic Tagset (Abzianidze and Bos, 2017) defines a crosslinguistic inventory of semantic classes for content and function words.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
"SNACS takes a similar approach to prepositions and possessives, which in Abzianidze and Bos’s (2017) specification are simply tagged REL, which does not disambiguate the nature of the relational meaning.",3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
Our categories can thus be understood as refinements to REL.,3.2 The SNACS Hierarchy,[0],[0]
Hwang et al. (2017) have pointed out the perils of teasing apart and generalizing preposition semantics so that each use has a clear supersense label.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
One key challenge they identified is that the preposition itself and the situation as established by the verb may suggest different labels.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"For instance:
(5) a. Vernon works at Grunnings.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"b. Vernon works for Grunnings.
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"The semantics of the scene in (5a, 5b) is the same: it is an employment relationship, and the PP contains the employer.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"SNACS has the label ORGROLE for this purpose.6 At the same time, at in (5a) strongly suggests a locational relationship, which would correspond to the label LOCUS; consistent with this
6ORGROLE is defined as “Either a party in a relation between an organization/institution and an individual who has a stable affiliation with that organization, such as membership or a business relationship.”
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"hypothesis, Where does Vernon work? is a perfectly good way to ask a question that could be answered by the PP.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"In this example, then, there is overlap between locational meaning and organizationalbelonging meaning.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
(5b) is similar except the for suggests a notion of BENEFICIARY:,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
the employee is working on behalf of the employer.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
Annotators would face a conundrum if forced to pick a single label when multiple ones appear to be relevant.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Schneider et al. (2016) handled overlap via multiple inheritance, but entertaining a new label for every possible case of overlap is impractical, as this would result in a proliferation of supersenses.
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Instead, Hwang et al. (2017) suggest a construal analysis in which the lexical semantic contribution, or henceforth the function, of the preposition itself may be distinct from the semantic role or relation mediated by the preposition in a given sentence, called the scene role.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
The notion of scene role is a widely accepted idea that underpins the use of semantic or thematic roles: semantics licensed by the governor7 of the prepositional phrase dictates its relationship to the prepositional phrase.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"The innovative claim is that, in addition to a preposition’s relationship with its head, the prepositional choice introduces another layer of meaning or construal that brings additional nuance, creating the difficulty we see in the annotation of (5a, 5b).",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
Construal is notated by ROLE;FUNCTION.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Thus, (5a) would be annotated ORGROLE;LOCUS and (5b) as ORGROLE;BENEFICIARY to expose their common truth-semantic meaning but slightly different portrayals owing to the different prepositions.
",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Another useful application of the construal analysis is with the verb put, which can combine with any locative PP to express a destination:
(6) Put it on/by/behind/on_top_of/. . .",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]

I.e., the preposition signals a LOCUS, but the door serves as the GOAL with respect to the scene.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"This approach also allows for resolution of various se-
7By “governor” of the preposition or prepositional phrase, we mean the head of the phrase to which the PP attaches in a constituency representation.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"In a dependency representation, this would be the head of the preposition itself or of the object of the preposition depending on which convention is used for PP headedness: e.g., the preposition heads the PP in CoNLL and Stanford Dependencies whereas the object is the head in Universal Dependencies.",3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
The governor is most often a verb or noun.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
"Where the PP is a predicate complement (e.g. Vernon is with Grunnings), there is no governor to specify the nature of the scene, so annotators must rely on world knowledge and context to determine the scene.

Both role and function slots are filled by supersenses from the SNACS hierarchy.,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]
Annotators have the option of using distinct supersenses for the role and function; in general it is not a requirement (though we stipulate that certain SNACS supersenses can only be used as the role).,3.3 Adopting the Construal Analysis,[0],[0]

"We chose SaintExupéry’s novella The Little Prince, which is readily available in many languages and has been annotated with semantic representations such as AMR (Banarescu et al., 2013).",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"The genre is markedly different from online reviews—it is quite literary, and employs archaic or poetic figures of speech.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"It is also a translation from French, contributing to the markedness of the language.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
This text is therefore a challenge for an annotation scheme based on colloquial contemporary English.,5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"We addressed this issue by running 3 practice rounds of annotation on small passages from The Little Prince, both to assess whether the scheme was applicable without major guidelines changes and to prepare the annotators for this genre.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"For the final annotation study, we chose chapters 4 and 5, in which 242 markables of 52 types were identified heuristically (§6.2).",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"The types of, to, in, as, from, and for, as well as possessives, occurred at least 10 times.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]
"Annotators had the option to mark units as false positives using special labels (see §4) in addition to expressing uncertainty about the unit.

"Agreement is higher on the function slot than on the scene role slot, which implies that the former is an easier task than the latter.",5 Interannotator Agreement Study,[0],[0]

We now describe systems that identify and disambiguate SNACS-annotated prepositions and possessives in two steps.,6 Disambiguation Systems,[0],[0]
Target identification heuristics (§6.2) first determine which tokens (single-word or multiword) should receive a SNACS supersense.,6 Disambiguation Systems,[0],[0]
A supervised classifier then predicts a supersense analysis for each identified target.,6 Disambiguation Systems,[0],[0]

"Furthermore, 14.1% of tokens labeled as adpositions or possessives are not annotated because they are part of a multiword expression (MWE).",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"It is therefore neither obvious nor trivial to decide which tokens and groups of tokens should be selected as targets for SNACS annotation.
",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"To facilitate both manual annotation and automatic classification, we developed heuristics for identifying annotation targets.",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"The algorithm first scans the sentence for known multiword expressions, using a blacklist of non-prepositional MWEs that contain preposition tokens (e.g., take_care_of ) and a whitelist of prepositional MWEs (multiword prepositions like out_of and PP idioms like in_town).",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
Both lists were constructed from the training data.,6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"From segments unaffected by the MWE heuristics, single-word candidates are identified by matching a high-recall set of parts of speech, then filtered through 5 different heuristics for adpositions, possessives, subordinating conjunctions, adverbs, and infinitivals.",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]
"Most of these filters are based on lexical lists learned from the training portion of the STREUSLE corpus, but there are some specific rules for infinitivals that handle forsubjects (I opened the door for Steve to take out the trash—to, but not for, should receive a supersense) and comparative constructions with too and enough (too short to ride).",6.2 Target Identification,[0],[0]

"We briefly describe the feature set here, and refer the reader to the original work for further details.",6.3 Classification,[0],[0]
"At a high level, it consists of features extracted from selected neighboring words in the dependency tree (i.e., heuristically identified governor and object) and in the sentence (previous verb, noun and adjective, and next noun).",6.3 Classification,[0],[0]

"For each identified target unit u, we extract its first token, and its governor and object headword.",6.3 Classification,[0],[0]

The rest of this section presents analyses of the results along various axes.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
Target identification.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
The identification heuristics described in §6.2 achieve an F1 score of 89.2% on the test set using gold syntax.15,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
Most false positives (47/54=87%) can be ascribed to tokens that are part of a (non-adpositional or larger adpositional) multiword expression.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"9 of the 50 false negatives (18%) are rare multiword expressions not occurring in the training data and there are 7 partially identified ones, which are counted as both false positives and false negatives.
",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
Automatically generated parse trees slightly decrease quality (table 4).,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Target identification, being the first step in the pipeline, imposes an upper bound on disambiguation scores.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"We observe this degradation when we compare the Gold ID and the Auto ID blocks of table 5, where automatically identified targets decrease F-score by about 10 points in all settings.16
Classification.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Along with the statistical classifier results in table 5, we also report performance
15Our evaluation script counts tokens that received special labels in the gold standard (see §4) as negative examples of SNACS targets, with the exception of the tokens labeled as unintelligible/nonnative/etc., which are not counted toward or against target ID performance.

"Note that all learned classifiers, across all settings, outperform the most frequent baseline for both role and function prediction.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"The feature-rich and the neural models perform roughly equivalently despite the significantly different modeling strategies.

Function and scene role performance.,6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Function prediction is consistently more accurate than role prediction, with roughly a 10-point gap across all systems.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"This mirrors a similar effect in the interannotator agreement scores (see §5), and may be due to the reduced ambiguity of functions compared to roles (as attested by the baseline’s higher accuracy for functions than roles), and by the more literal nature of function labels, as opposed to role labels that often require more context to determine.
Impact of automatic syntax.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"Automatic syntactic analysis decreases scores by 4 to 7 points, most likely due to parsing errors which affect the identification of the preposition’s object and governor.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
"In the auto ID/auto syntax condition, the worse target ID performance with automatic parses (noted above) contributes to lower classification scores.",6.4 Results & Analysis,[0],[0]
We can use the structure of the SNACS hierarchy to probe classifier performance.,6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
"As with the interannotator study, we evaluate the accuracy of predicted labels when they are coarsened post hoc by moving up the hierarchy to a specific depth.",6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
"Table 6 shows this for the feature-rich classifier for different depths, with depth-1 representing the coarsening of the labels into the 3 root labels.",6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
Depth-4 (Exact) represents the full results in table 5.,6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
These results show that the classifiers often mistake a label for another that is nearby in the hierarchy.,6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]
"Examining the most frequent confusions of both models, we observe that LOCUS is overpredicted
(which makes sense as it is most frequent overall), and SOCIALROLE–ORGROLE and GESTALT– POSSESSOR are often confused (they are close in the hierarchy: one inherits from the other).",6.5 Errors & Confusions,[0],[0]

"In compressed sensing, we wish to acquire an n-dimensional signal x ∈ Rn using only m n measurements linear in x.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The measurements could potentially be noisy, but even in the absence of any noise we need to impose additional structure on the signal to guarantee unique recovery.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Classical results on compressed sensing impose structure by assuming the underlying signal to be approximately l-sparse in some known basis, i.e., the l-largest entries dominate the rest.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, images and audio signals are typically sparse in the wavelet and Fourier basis respectively (Mallat, 2008).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"If the matrix of linear vectors relating the signal and measurements satisfies certain mild conditions, then one can provably recover x with only m = O(l log nl ) measurements using LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996; Candès & Tao, 2005; Donoho, 2006; Candès et al., 2006; Bickel et al., 2009).

"Alternatively, structural assumptions on the signals being sensed can be learned from data, e.g., using a dataset of typical signals (Baraniuk et al., 2010; Peyre, 2010; Chen et al., 2010; Yu & Sapiro, 2011).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Particularly relevant to this work, Bora et al. (2017) proposed an approach where structure is provided by a deep generative model learned from data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"Consequently, the signal x is recovered by optimizing for a latent vector z that minimizes the `2 distance between the measurements corresponding to G(z) and the actual ones.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Even though the objective being optimized in this case is non-convex, empirical results suggest that the reconstruction error decreases much faster than LASSO-based recovery as we increase the number of measurements.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A limitation of the above approach is that the recovered signal is constrained to be in the range of the generator function G. Hence, if the true signal being sensed is not in the range of G, the algorithm cannot drive the reconstruction error to zero even when m ≥ n",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
(even if we ignore error due to measurement noise and non-convex optimization).,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is also observed empirically, as the reconstruction error of generative model-based recovery saturates as we keep
increasing the number of measurements m. On the other hand, LASSO-based recovery continues to shrink the error with increasing number of measurements, eventually outperforming the generative model-based recovery.

"The recovered signals have the general form of G(ẑ) + ν̂, where ν̂ ∈ Rn is a sparse vector.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This allows the recovery algorithm to consider signals away from the range of the generator function.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Similar to LASSO, we relax the hardness in optimizing for sparse vectors by minimizing the `1 norm of the deviations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

The above lemma shows that there exists a decoder such that the error in recovery can be upper bounded for measurement matrices satisfying S-REC and RIP.,4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
Note that Lemma 1 only guarantees the existence of such a decoder and does not prescribe an optimization algorithm for recovery.,4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
"Apart from the errors due to the bounded measurement noise max and a scaled slack term appearing in the S-REC condition δ′, the major term in the upper bound corresponds to (up to constants) the minimum possible error incurred by the best possible recovery vector in Sl,G given by σl,G(x).",4.

"The first term includes dependence on the Lipschitz constant L of the generative model function G. A high Lipschitz constant makes recovery harder (by requiring a larger
number of measurements), but only contributes logarithmically.",4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]

Such recovery requires measurement matrices that satisfy both the RIP and S-REC conditions over the set of vectors that deviate in sparse directions from the range of a generative model function.,4. Theoretical Analysis,[0],[0]
"In Theorems 1-2, we observed that the number of measurements required to guarantee recovery with high probability grow almost linearly (with some logarithmic terms) with the latent space dimensionality k of the generative model and the permissible sparsity l for deviating from the range of the generative model.",4.

"In the case of sparse recovery methods (including Sparse-Gen) it is possible that unconstrained optimization returns signals outside the domain of interest, in which case they are projected to the required domain by simple clipping, i.e., any signal less than zero is clipped to 0 and similarly any signal greater than one is clipped to 1.

The reconstruction errors for varying number of measurements are given in Figure 2.,5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Consistent with the theory, the strong prior in generative modelbased recovery methods outperforms the LASSO-based methods for sparse vector recovery.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In the regime of low measurements, the performance of algorithms that can incorporate the generative model prior dominates over methods modeling sparsity using LASSO.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The performance of plain generative model-based methods however saturates with increasing measurements, unlike Sparse-Gen and LASSO which continue to shrink the error.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The trends are consistent for both MNIST and Omniglot, although we observe the relative magnitudes of errors in the case of Omniglot are much higher than that of MNIST.",5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
This is expected due to the increased diversity and variations of the structure of the signals being sensed in the case of Omniglot.,5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
We also observe the trends to be consistent across the various norms considered.,5. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
One of the primary motivations for compressive sensing is to directly acquire the signals using few measurements.,5.1. Transfer compressed sensing,[0],[0]

"For both the sourcetarget pairs, we observe that the Sparse-Gen consistently performs well.",5.1. Transfer compressed sensing,[0],[0]
Vanilla generative model-based recovery shows hardly an improvements with increasing measurements.,5.1. Transfer compressed sensing,[0],[0]
We can qualitatively see this phenomena for transferring from MNIST (source) to Omniglot (target) in Figure 4.,5.1. Transfer compressed sensing,[0],[0]
"With only m = 100 measurements, all models perform poorly and generative model based methods particularly continue to sense images similar to MNIST.",5.1. Transfer compressed sensing,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, there is a noticeable transition at m = 200 measurements for SparseVAE where it adapts better to the domain being sensed than plain generative model-based recovery and achieves lower reconstruction error.",5.1. Transfer compressed sensing,[0],[0]
"Since the introduction of compressed sensing over a decade ago, there has been a vast body of research studying various extensions and applications (Candès & Tao, 2005; Donoho,

"This work explores the effect of modeling different structural assumptions on signals in theory and practice.
",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
Themes around sparsity in a well-chosen basis has driven much of the research in this direction.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For instance, the paradigm of model-based compressed sensing accounts for the interdependencies between the dimensions of a sparse data signal (Baraniuk et al., 2010; Duarte & Eldar, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2017).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, adaptive selection of basis vectors from a dictionary that best capture the structure of the particular signal being sensed has also been explored (Peyre, 2010; Tang et al., 2013).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Many of these methods have been extended to recovery of structured tensors (Zhang et al., 2013; 2014).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In another prominent line of research involving Bayesian compressed sensing, the sparseness assumption is formalized by placing sparsenesspromoting priors on the signals (Ji et al., 2008; He & Carin, 2009; Babacan et al., 2010; Baron et al., 2010).
",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
Research exploring structure beyond sparsity is relatively scarce.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
Early works in this direction can be traced to Baraniuk & Wakin (2009) who proposed algorithms for recovering signals lying on a smooth manifold.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
The generative model-based recovery methods consider functions that do not necessarily define manifolds since the range of a generator function could intersect with itself.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]

algorithms for efficient sensing of signals from a mixture of Gaussians.",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
The recent work in deep generative model-based recovery differs in key theoretical aspects as well in the use of a more expressive family of models based on neural networks.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
A related recent work by Hand & Voroninski (2017) provides theoretical guarantees on the solution recovered for solving non-convex linear inverse problems with deep generative priors.,6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Empirical advances based on well-designed deep neural network architectures that sacrifice many of the theoretical guarantees have been proposed for applications such as MRI (Mardani et al., 2017; 2018).",6. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Many recent methods propose to learn mappings of signals to measurements using neural networks, instead of restricting them to be linear, random matrices (Mousavi et al., 2015; Kulkarni et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018).

"Meanwhile, semantic slots defined in traditional LU systems are on a plain level, while there is no structure to indicate their relation.
",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"To solve this problem, we propose to use atomic concepts to represent the semantic slots.",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
Atomic concepts are exploited to break down the slots.,3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"We
represent the semantic slots as atomic concept tuples (Figure 1 is an example).",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"The semantic slot composed of these atomic concepts can keep a unified resource for concept definition and extend the semantic knowledge flexibly.

"The concept tuple is ordered.
",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"In general, atomic concepts can be classified into two categories, one is value-aware and the other is context-aware.",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
The principle for defining slot as a concept branch is: lower dimension less context-aware.,3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"For example, “city name” and “airport name” depend on rare context (valueaware).",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
They should be located in the first dimension.,3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]

"The atomic concept tuple shows the inner relation between different semantic slots explicitly.
",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the procedure of constructing atomic concept tuples for slots can be divided into the following steps.
",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"• Firstly, we build a vocabularyC of the atomic concepts for all the slots.",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"By analyzing the conceptual intersection of different slots, we can split the slots into smaller ones which are called atomic concepts.",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"After that, each slot is represented as a set of atomic concepts which are not ordered.
",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"• Secondly, we gather the atoms into different groups.",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
Atomic concepts from the same group should be mutually exclusive.,3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"Therefore we can investigate the inner relation and outer relation of these groups.
",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
"• Finally, each group is associated with one dimension (Ci) of the atomic concept tuple.",3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
The groups are ordered depending on whether they are value-aware or contextaware.,3 Atomic Concept Tuples,[0],[0]
The slot filling is typically considered as a sequence labelling problem.,4 Concept Transfer Learning,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we only consider the sequence-labelling based slot filling task.",4 Concept Transfer Learning,[0],[0]

Value set mismatch task evaluates the generalization capability of different slot filling models.,6 Experiments,[0],[0]

"Since the semantically annotated data is always limited, only a part of values
is seen in the training data.",6 Experiments,[0],[0]
Will the slot filling model perform well on the unseen values?,6 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To answer this question, we synthesize a test set by the values mismatched with the training set of ATIS corpus.",6 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our methods may take advantages of the prior knowledge about slot relations based on the atomic concepts and the literal descriptions of slot names.

Domain adaptation task evaluates the adaptation capability of our methods when they meet new slots in the target domain.,6 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In this task, a seed training set of the target domain is provided.",6 Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, it is very limited: 1) some new slots may not be covered; 2) not all contexts are covered for each new slot.",6 Experiments,[0],[0]
The atomic-concepts based method would alleviate this problem.,6 Experiments,[0],[0]

Recently a variety of LSTM-based conditional language models (LM) have been applied across a range of language generation tasks. In this work we study various model architectures and different ways to represent and aggregate the source information in an endto-end neural dialogue system framework. A method called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance improvements independent of which architecture is used.",text,[0],[0]
"Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based conditional language models (LM) have been shown to be very effective in tackling a number of real world problems, such as machine translation (MT) (Cho et al., 2014) and image caption generation (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recently, RNNs were applied to task of generating sentences from an explicit semantic representation (Wen et al., 2015a).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Attention-based methods (Mei et al., 2016) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)-like (Hochreiter

"Although it is now clear that LSTMbased conditional LMs can generate plausible natural language, less effort has been put in comparing the different model architectures.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, conditional generation models are typically tested on relatively straightforward tasks conditioned on a single source (e.g. a sentence or an image) and where the goal is to optimise a single metric (e.g. BLEU).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we study the use of conditional LSTMs in the generation component of neural network (NN)-based dialogue systems which depend on multiple conditioning sources and optimising multiple metrics.

"Neural conversational agents (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015) are direct extensions of the sequence-to-sequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014) in which a conversation is cast as a source to target transduction problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, these models are still far from real world applications because they lack any capability for supporting domain specific tasks, for example, being able to interact with databases (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2016) and aggregate useful information into their responses.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"In Wen et al. (2016a), the objective function for learning the dialogue policy and language generator depends solely on the likelihood of the output sentences.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this sequential supervision signal may not be informative enough to learn a good conditioning vector representation resulting in a generation process which is dominated by the LM.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This can often lead to inappropriate system outputs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we therefore also investigate the use of snapshot learning which attempts to mitigate this problem by heuristically applying companion supervision signals to a subset of the conditioning vector.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This idea is similar to deeply supervised nets (Lee et al., 2015) in which the final cost from the output layer is optimised together with the companion signals generated from each intermediary layer.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We have found that snapshot learning offers several benefits: (1) it consistently improves performance; (2) it learns discriminative and robust feature representations and alleviates the vanishing gradient problem; (3) it appears to learn transparent and interpretable subspaces of the conditioning vector.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Machine learning approaches to task-oriented dialogue system design have cast the problem as a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) (Young et al., 2013) with the aim of using reinforcement learning (RL) to train dialogue policies online through interactions with real users (Gašić et al., 2013).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In order to make RL tractable, the state and action space must be carefully designed (Young et al., 2010) and the understanding (Henderson et al., 2014; Mrkšić et al., 2015) and generation (Wen et al., 2015b; Wen et al., 2016b) modules were assumed available or trained standalone on supervised corpora.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]

"Snapshot learning can be viewed as a special form of weak supervision (also known as distant- or self supervision) (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Snow et al., 2004), in which supervision signals are heuristically labelled by matching unlabelled corpora with entities or attributes in a structured database.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]

"In practice, snapshot learning is similar to deeply supervised nets (Lee et al., 2015) in which companion objectives are generated from intermediary layers and optimised altogether with the output objective.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The testbed for this work is a neural network-based task-oriented dialogue system proposed by Wen et al. (2016a).,3 Neural Dialogue System,[0],[0]
"The model casts dialogue as a source to target sequence transduction problem (modelled by a sequence-to-sequence architecture (Sutskever et al., 2014))",3 Neural Dialogue System,[0],[0]
"augmented with the dialogue history (modelled by a belief tracker (Henderson et al., 2014)) and the current database search outcome (modelled by a database operator).",3 Neural Dialogue System,[0],[0]
The model consists of both encoder and decoder modules.,3 Neural Dialogue System,[0],[0]
The details of each module are given below.,3 Neural Dialogue System,[0],[0]
"At each turn t, the goal of the encoder is to produce a distributed representation of the system action mt, which is then used to condition a decoder to generate the next system response in skeletal form1.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"It consists of four submodules: intent network, belief tracker, database operator, and policy network.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]

The hidden layer of the LSTM at the last encoding step zt is taken as the representation.,3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"As mentioned in Wen et al. (2016a), this representation can be viewed as a distributed version of the speech act (Traum, 1999) used in traditional systems.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"Belief Trackers In addition to the intent network, the neural dialogue system uses a set of slot-based belief trackers (Henderson et al., 2014; Mrkšić et al., 2015) to track user requests.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"By taking each user input as new evidence, the task of a belief tracker is to maintain a multinomial distribution p over values v ∈",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"Vs for each informable slot2 s, and a binary distribution for each requestable slot2.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
These probability distributions pst are called belief states of the system.,3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"The belief states pst , together with the intent vector zt, can be viewed as the system’s comprehension of the user requests up to turn t. Database Operator Based on the belief states pst , a DB query is formed by taking the union of the maximum values of each informable slot.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"A vector xt representing different degrees of matching in the DB (no match, 1 match, ... or more than 5 matches) is produced by counting the number of matched entities and expressing it as a 6-bin 1-hot encoding.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"If xt is not zero, an associated entity pointer is maintained which identifies one of the matching DB entities selected at random.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
The entity pointer is updated if the current entity no longer matches the search criteria; otherwise it stays the same.,3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]
"Policy Network Based on the vectors zt, pst , and xt from the above three modules, the policy network combines them into a single action vector mt by a three-way matrix transformation,
mt = tanh(Wzmzt + Wxmxt + ∑ s∈G W s pmp s t ) (1)
where matrices Wzm, Wspm, and Wxm are parameters and G is the domain ontology.",3.1 Encoder Module,[0],[0]

This model was motivated by the fact that long-term dependency is not needed for the conditioning vector because we apply this information at every step j anyway.",3.2.1 Conditional Generation Network,[0],[0]
The decoupling of the conditioning vector and the LM is attractive because it leads to better interpretability of the results and provides the potential to learn a better conditioning vector and LM.,3.2.1 Conditional Generation Network,[0],[0]

An attention-based mechanism provides an effective approach for aggregating multiple information sources for prediction tasks.,3.2.2 Attention and Belief Representation,[0],[0]

Belief Representation The effect of different belief state representations on the end performance are also studied.,3.2.2 Attention and Belief Representation,[0],[0]
"For user informable slots, the full belief state pst is the original state containing all categorical values; the summary belief state contains only three components: the summed value of all categorical probabilities, the probability that the user said they “don’t care” about this slot and the probability that the slot has not been mentioned.",3.2.2 Attention and Belief Representation,[0],[0]
"For user requestable slots, on the other hand, the full belief state is the same as the summary belief state because the slot values are binary rather than categorical.",3.2.2 Attention and Belief Representation,[0],[0]
"Learning conditional generation models from sequential supervision signals can be difficult, because it requires the model to learn both long-term word dependencies and potentially distant source encoding functions.",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
"To mitigate this difficulty, we introduce a novel method called snapshot learning to create a vector of binary labels Υjt ∈",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]

"In order to make the tanh activations of m̂jt compatible with the 0-1 snapshot labels, we squeeze each
value of m̂jt by adding 1 and dividing by 2 before computing the cost.
",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
"The indicator functions we use in this work have two forms: (1) whether a particular slot value (e.g., [v.food]1) is going to occur, and (2) whether the system has offered a venue3, as shown in Figure 2.",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
The offer label in the snapshot is produced by checking the delexicalised name token ([v.name]) in the entire dialogue.,3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
"If it has occurred, every label in subsequent turns is labelled with 1.",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
Otherwise it is labelled with 0.,3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
"To create snapshot targets for a particular slot value, the output sentence is matched with the corresponding delexicalised token turn by turn, per generation step.",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
"At each generation step, the target is labelled with 0 if that delexicalised token has been generated; otherwise it is set to 1.",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
"However, for the models without attention, the targets per turn are set to the same because the condition vector will not be able to learn the dynamically changing behaviour without attention.",3.3 Snapshot Learning,[0],[0]
"Dataset The dataset used in this work was collected in the Wizard-of-Oz online data collection described by Wen et al. (2016a), in which the task of the system is to assist users to find a restaurant in Cambridge, UK area.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]

slots) that the user can ask a value for once a restaurant has been offered.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
There are 676 dialogues in the dataset (including both finished and unfinished dialogues) and approximately 2750 turns in total.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
The database contains 99 unique restaurants.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
Training The training procedure was divided into two stages.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Firstly, the belief tracker parameters θb were pre-trained using cross entropy errors between tracker labels and predictions.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Having fixed the tracker parameters, the remaining parts of the model θ\b are trained using the cross entropy errors from the generation network LM,
L(θ\b) =",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"− ∑
t ∑ j H(y t j ,p t j) + λLss(·) (3)
where ytj and p t j are output token targets and predictions respectively, at turn t of output step j, Lss(·) is the snapshot cost from Equation 2, and λ is the tradeoff parameter in which we set to 1 for all models trained with snapshot learning.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
We treated each dialogue as a batch and used stochastic gradient descent with a small l2 regularisation term to train the model.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The collected corpus was partitioned into a training, validation, and testing sets in the ratio 3:1:1.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
Early stopping was implemented based on the validation set considering only LM log-likelihoods.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
Gradient clipping was set to 1.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The hidden layer sizes were set to 50, and the weights were randomly
initialised between -0.3 and 0.3 including word embeddings.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The vocabulary size is around 500 for both input and output, in which rare words and words that can be delexicalised have been removed.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Decoding In order to compare models trained with different recipes rather than decoding strategies, we decode all the trained models with the average log probability of tokens in the sentence.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We applied beam search with a beamwidth equal to 10, the search stops when an end-of-sentence token is generated.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In order to consider language variability, we ran decoding until 5 candidates were obtained and performed evaluation on them.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
Metrics We compared models trained with different recipes by performing a corpus-based evaluation in which the model is used to predict each system response in the held-out test set.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Three evaluation metrics were used: BLEU score (on top-1 and top5 candidates) (Papineni et al., 2002), slot matching rate and objective task success rate (Su et al., 2015).",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The dialogue is marked as successful if both: (1) the offered entity matches the task that was specified to the user, and (2) the system answered all the associated information requests (e.g. what is the address?) from the user.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The slot matching rate is the percentage of delexicalised tokens (e.g. [s.food] and [v.area]1) appear in the candidate also appear in the
reference.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
We computed the BLEU scores on the skeletal sentence forms before substituting with the actual entity values.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
All the results were averaged over 10 random initialised networks.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
Results Table 1 shows the evaluation results.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
The numbers to the left and right of each table cell are the same model trained w/o and w/ snapshot learning.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
The first observation is that snapshot learning consistently improves on most metrics regardless of the model architecture.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
This is especially true for BLEU scores.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We think this may be attributed to the more discriminative conditioning vector learned through the snapshot method, which makes the learning of the conditional LM easier.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In the first block belief state representation, we compare the effect of two different belief representations.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, using a succinct representation is better (summary>full) because the identity of each categorical value in the belief state does not help when the generation decisions are done in skeletal form.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In fact, the full belief state representation may encourage the model to learn incorrect coadaptation among features when the data is scarce.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In the conditional architecture block, we compare the three different conditional generation architectures as described in section 3.2.1.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This result shows that the language model type (lm) and memory type (mem) networks perform better in terms of BLEU score and slot matching rate, while the hybrid type (hybrid) networks achieve higher task success.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is probably due to the degree of separation be-
tween the LM and conditioning vector: a coupling approach (lm, mem) sacrifices the conditioning vector but learns a better LM and higher BLEU; while a complete separation (hybrid) learns a better conditioning vector and offers a higher task success.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Lastly, in the attention-based model block we train the three architectures with the attention mechanism and compare them again.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Firstly, the characteristics of the three models we observed above also hold for attention-based models.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Secondly, we found that the attention mechanism improves all the three architectures on task success rate but not BLEU scores.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is probably due to the limitations of using n-gram based metrics like BLEU to evaluate the generation quality (Stent et al., 2005).",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
Gate Activations We first studied the average activation of each individual gate in the models by averaging them when running generation on the test set.,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
We analysed the hybrid models because their reading gate to output gate activation ratio (rj/oj) shows clear tradeoff between the LM and the conditioning vector components.,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in Ta-
ble 2, we found that the average forget gate activations (fj) and the ratio of the reading gate to the output gate activation (rj/oj) have strong correlations to performance: a better performance (row 3>row 2>row 1) seems to come from models that can learn a longer word dependency (higher forget gate ft activations) and a better conditioning vector (therefore higher reading to output gate ratio rj/oj).",5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
Learned Attention We have visualised the learned attention heat map of models trained with and without snapshot learning in Figure 3.,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
The attention is on both the informable slot trackers (first three columns) and the requestable slot trackers (the other columns).,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
We found that the model trained with snapshot learning (Figure 3b) seems to produce a more accurate and discriminative attention heat map comparing to the one trained without it (Figure 3a).,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
This may contribute to the better performance achieved by the snapshot learning approach.,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
Snapshot Neurons,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
"As mentioned earlier, snapshot learning forces a subspace of the conditioning vector m̂jt to become discriminative and interpretable.",5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
Three example generated sentences together with the snapshot neuron activations are shown in Figure 4.,5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, when generating words one by one, the neuron activations were changing to detect different events they were assigned by the snapshot training signals: e.g. in Figure 4b the light blue and orange neurons switched their domination role when the token [v.address] was generated; the offered neuron is in a high activation state in Figure 4b because the system was offering a venue, while in Figure 4a it is not activated because the system was still helping the user to find a venue.",5 Model Analysis,[0],[0]
This paper has investigated different conditional generation architectures and a novel method called snapshot learning to improve response generation in a neural dialogue system framework.,6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
The results showed three major findings.,6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Firstly, although the hybrid type model did not rank highest on all metrics, it is nevertheless preferred because it achieved the highest task success and also it provided more interpretable results.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Secondly, snapshot learning provided gains on virtually all metrics regardless of the architecture used.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"The analysis suggested that the benefit of snapshot learning mainly comes from the more discriminative and robust subspace representation learned from the heuristically labelled companion signals, which in turn facilitates optimisation of the final target objective.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Lastly, the results suggested that by making a complex system more interpretable at different levels not only helps our understanding but also leads to the highest success rates.
",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"However, there is still much work left to do.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
This work focused on conditional generation architectures and snapshot learning in the scenario of generating dialogue responses.,6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
It would be very helpful if the same comparison could be conducted in other application domains such as machine translation or image caption generation so that a wider view of the effectiveness of these approaches can be assessed.,6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, removing slot-value delexicalisation and learning confirmation behaviour in noisy speech conditions are also main research problems from the system development prospective.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]

"In this paper, we addressed the problem of density estimation for unnormalised models where the normalising partition function cannot be computed.",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
We proposed a new method that follows the principles of noise-contrastive estimation and “learning by comparison”.,5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"In contrast to noisecontrastive estimation (NCE), in the proposed conditional noise-contrastive estimation (CNCE), the contrastive noise is allowed to depend on the data.
",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"The main advantage of allowing the noise distribution to depend on the data is that the information in the data can be leveraged to produce, with rather simple conditional noise distributions as for example a Gaussian, noise samples that are well adapted to a wide range of different data and model

types.",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"A second advantage is that for symmetric conditional noise distributions, a closed form expression for the conditional noise is not needed, which both enables a wider choice of distributions and has computational benefits.",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"If the value of the normalisation constant is not of interest, a third advantage of the proposed approach is that the intractable partition function cancels out.",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Unlike in noise-contrastive estimation, there is thus never a need to introduce an additional parameter for the scaling of the model.
",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
We provided theoretical and empirical arguments that CNCE provides a consistent estimator and proved that score matching emerges as a limiting case.,5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"As score matching makes more stringent assumptions but does not rely on sampling, it is an open question whether we can use this result to e.g. devise a hybrid approach where parts of the model are automatically estimated with the more suitable method.
",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We further found that the relative performances of NCE and CNCE are model dependent, but that CNCE has an
advantage in the important case where the data lie in a lower dimensional manifold.
",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"An inherent limitation of empirical comparisons, and hence also those performed here, is that the results depend on the models and noise distributions used.",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"However, given the adaptive nature of CNCE, simple Gaussian conditional noise distributions are likely widely useful, as exemplified by our results on unsupervised deep learning of a neural image model.
",5. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"The proposed method further allows one to iteratively adapt the conditional noise distribution to make the classification task successively more challenging, as it was done in some simulations for NCE (Gutmann & Hyvärinen, 2010), and generally for learning in generative latent variable models (Gutmann et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2014).",5.

They are easy and trustworthy to apply for most scenarios.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While there exists a long history on ensemble methods, the progress on developing more advanced ensembles specialized for deep neural networks has been slow.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite continued efforts that apply various ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting to deep models, it has been observed that traditional independent ensembles (IE) which train models independently with random initialization achieve the best performance (Ciregan et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2015).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we focus on developing more advanced ensembles for deep models utilizing the concept of multiple choice learning (MCL).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The MCL concept was originally proposed in (GuzmanRivera et al., 2012) under the scenario when inference procedures are cascaded:
(a) First, generate a set of plausible outputs.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"(b) Then, pick the correct solution form the set.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, (Park & Ramanan, 2011; Batra et al., 2012) proposed human-pose estimation methods which produce multiple predictions and then refine them by employing a temporal model, and (Collins & Koo, 2005) proposed a sentence parsing method which re-ranks the output of an initial system which produces a set of plausible outputs (Huang & Chiang, 2005).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In such scenarios, the goal of the first stage (a) is generating a set of plausible outputs such that at least one of them is correct for the second stage (b), e.g., human operators.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Under this motivation, MCL has been studied (Guzman-Rivera et al., 2014; 2012; Lee et al., 2016), where various applications have been demonstrated, e.g., image classification (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), semantic segmentation (Everingham et al., 2010) and image captioning (Lin et al., 2014b).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"It trains an ensemble of multiple models by minimizing the so-called oracle loss, only focusing on the most accurate prediction produced by them.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Consequently, it makes each model specialized for a certain subset of data, not for the entire one similarly as mixture-of-expert schemes (Jacobs et al., 1991).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although MCL focuses on the first stage (a) in cascaded scenarios and thus can produce diverse/plausible outputs, it might be not useful if one does not have a good scheme for
the second stage (b).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"One can use a certain average/voting scheme of the predictions made by models for (b), but MCL using deep neural networks often fails to make a correct decision since each network tends to be overconfident in its prediction.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Namely, the oracle error/loss of MCL is low, but its top-1 error rate might be very high.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Contribution.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To address the issue, we develop the concept of confident MCL (CMCL) that does not lose any benefit of the original MCL, while its target loss and architecture are redesigned for making the second stage (b) easier.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, it targets to generate a set of diverse/plausible confident predictions from which one can pick the correct one using a simple average/voting scheme.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To this end, we first propose a new loss function, called confident oracle loss, for relaxing the overconfidence issue of MCL.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our key idea is to additionally minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence from a predictive distribution to the uniform one in order to give confidence to non-specialized models.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Then, CMCL that minimizes the new loss can be efficiently trained like the original MCL for certain classes of models including neural networks, via stochastic alternating minimization (Lee et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, when CMCL is applied to deep models, we propose two additional regularization techniques for boosting its performance: feature sharing and stochastic labeling.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite the new components, we note that the training complexity of CMCL is almost same to that of MCL or IE.
We apply the new ensemble model trained by the new training scheme for several convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), and ResNet (He et al., 2016) for image classification on the CIFAR (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) and SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011) datasets, and fully-convolutional neural networks (FCNs) (Long et al., 2015) for foreground-background segmentation on the iCoseg dataset (Batra et al., 2010).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, for the image classification task, CMCL outperforms all baselines, i.e., the traditional IE and the original MCL, in top-1 error rates.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In particular, CMCL of 5 ResNet with 20 layers provides 14.05% and 6.60% relative reductions in the top-1 error rates from the corresponding IE on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, respectively.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, for the foreground-background segmentation task, CMCL using multiple FCNs with 4 layers also outperforms all baselines in top-1 error rates.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Each model trained by CMCL generates high-quality solutions by specializing for specific images while each model trained by IE does not.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We believe that our new approach should be of broader interest for many deep learning tasks requiring high accuracy.

"We describe the proposed loss and the corre-
sponding training scheme in Section 3.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Section 4 provides additional techniques for the proposed ensemble model.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Experimental results are reported in Section 5.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this section, we describe the basic concept of multiple choice learning (MCL) (Guzman-Rivera et al., 2014; 2012).",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"Throughout this paper, we denote the set {1, . . .",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
", n} by [n] for positive integer n.",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
The MCL scheme is a type of ensemble learning that produces diverse outputs of high quality.,2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"Formally, given a training dataset D = {(xi, yi) | i ∈",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"[N ], xi ∈ X , yi ∈ Y}, we consider an ensemble ofM models f , i.e., (f1, . . .",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
", fM ).",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"For some task-specific loss function ` (y, f (x)), the oracle loss over the dataset D is defined as follows:
LO (D) = N∑ i=1",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"min m∈[M ] ` (yi, fm (xi)) , (1)
while the traditional independent ensemble (IE) loss is
LE (D) =",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
N∑ i=1,2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"∑ m∈[M ] ` (yi, fm (xi)) .",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"(2)
If all models have the same capacity and one can obtain the (global) optimum of the IE loss with respect to the model parameters, then all trained models should produce the same outputs, i.e., f1 = . . .",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
= fM .,2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the oracle loss makes the most accurate model optimize the loss function ` (y, f (x)) for each data x. Therefore, MCL produces diverse outputs of high quality by forcing each model to be specialized on a part of the entire dataset.
",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
Minimizing the oracle loss (1) is harder than minimizing the independent ensemble loss (2) since the min function is a non-continuous function.,2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"To address the issue, (GuzmanRivera et al., 2012) proposed an iterative block coordinate decent algorithm and (Dey et al., 2015) reformulated this problem as a submodular optimization task in which ensemble models are trained sequentially in a boosting-like manner.",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"However, when one considers an ensemble of deep neural networks, it is challenging to apply these methods since they require either costly retraining or sequential training.",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"Recently, (Lee et al., 2016) overcame this issue by proposing a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based algorithm.",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"Throughout this paper, we primarily focus on ensembles of deep neural networks and use the SGD algorithm for optimizing the oracle loss (1) or its variants.",2.1. Multiple Choice Learning,[0],[0]
"The oracle loss (1) used for MCL is useful for producing diverse/plausible outputs, but it is often inappropriate for ap-
plications requiring a single choice, i.e., top-1 error.",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"This is because ensembles of deep neural networks tend to be overconfident in their predictions, and it is hard to judge a better solution from their outputs.",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"To explain this in more detail, we evaluate the performance of ensembles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the image classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009).",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
We train ensembles of 5 CNNs (two convolutional layers followed by a fully-connected layer) using MCL.,2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
We also train the models using traditional IE which trains each model independently under different random initializations.,2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
Figure 1 summarizes the class-wise test set accuracy of each ensemble member.,2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"In the case of MCL, most models become specialists for certain classes (see Figure 1(a)), while they are generalized in the case of traditional IE as shown in Figure 1(c).",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"However, as expected, each model trained by MCL significantly outperforms for its specialized classes than that trained by IE.",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"For choosing a single output, similar to (Wan et al., 2013; Ciregan et al., 2012), one can average the output probabilities from ensemble members trained by MCL, but the corresponding top-1 classification error rate is often very high (e.g., see Table 1 in Section 5).",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
This is because each model trained by MCL is overconfident for its non-specialized classes.,2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"To quantify this, we also compute the entropy of the predictive distribution on the test data and use this to evaluate the quality of confidence/uncertainty level.",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
Figure 2(a) reports the entropy extracted from the predictive distribution of one of ensemble models trained by MCL.,2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"One can observe that it has low entropy as expected for its specialized classes (i.e., classes that the model has a test accuracy higher than 90%).",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"However, even for non-specialized classes, it also has low entropy.",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"Due to this, with respect to top-1 error rates, simple averaging of models trained by MCL performs much worse than that of IE.",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"Such issue typically occurs in deep neural networks since it is well known that they are poor at quantifying predictive uncertainties, and tend to be easily overconfident (Nguyen et al., 2015).",2.2. Oracle Loss for Top-1 Choice,[0],[0]
"In this section, we propose a modified oracle loss for relaxing the issue of MCL described in the previous section.",3.1. Confident Oracle Loss,[0],[0]
"Suppose that the m-th model outputs the predictive distribution Pθm (y | x) given input x, where θm denotes the model parameters.",3.1. Confident Oracle Loss,[0],[0]

"By minimizing the KL divergence from the predictive distribution to the uniform one, the new loss forces the predictive distribution to be closer to the uniform one, i.e., zero confidence, on non-specialized data, while those for specialized data still follow the correct one.",3.1. Confident Oracle Loss,[0],[0]
"For example, for classification tasks, the most accurate model for each data is allowed to optimize the classification loss, while others are forced to give less confident predictions by minimizing the KL divergence.",3.1. Confident Oracle Loss,[0],[0]
"We remark that although we optimize the KL divergence only for non-specialized data, one can also do it even for specialized data to regularize each model (Pereyra et al., 2017).",3.1. Confident Oracle Loss,[0],[0]
"In order to minimize the confident oracle loss (3) efficiently, we use the following procedure (Guzman-Rivera et al., 2012), which optimizes model parameters {θm} and assignment variables {vmi } alternatively:

",3.2. Stochastic Alternating Minimization for Training,[0],[0]
The above scheme iteratively assigns each data to a particular model and then independently trains each model only using its assigned data.,3.2. Stochastic Alternating Minimization for Training,[0],[0]
"Even though it monotonically decreases the objective, it is still highly inefficient since it requires training each model multiple times until assignments {vmi } converge.",3.2. Stochastic Alternating Minimization for Training,[0],[0]
"To address the issue, we propose deciding assignments and update model parameters to the gradient directions once per each batch, similarly to (Lee et al., 2016).",3.2. Stochastic Alternating Minimization for Training,[0],[0]

Effect of Confident Oracle Loss,[0],[0]
"In this section, we introduce advanced techniques for reducing the overconfidence and improving the performance.",4. Regularization Techniques,[0],[0]
We first propose a feature sharing scheme that stochastically shares the features among member models of CMCL to further address the overconfidence issue.,4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
The primary reason why deep learning models are overconfident is that they do not always extract general features from data.,4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"For examples, assume that some deep model only trains frogs and roses for classifying them.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"Although there might exist many kinds of features on their images, the model might make a decision based only on some specific features, e.g., colors.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"In this case, ‘red’ apples can be classified as rose with high confidence.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
Such an issue might be more severe in CMCL (and MCL) compared to IE since members of CMCL are specialized to certain data.,4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"To address the issue, we suggest the feature ensemble approach that encourages each model to generate meaningful abstractions from rich features extracted from other models.
",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"Formally, consider an ensemble ofM neural networks with L hidden layers.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"We denote the weight matrix for layer
` of model m ∈",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"[M ] and `-th hidden feature of model m by W`m and h ` m, respectively.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"Instead of sharing the whole units of a hidden feature, we introduce random binary masks determining which units to be shared with other models.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"We denote the mask for layer ` from model n to m as σ`nm ∼ Bernoulli(λ), which has the same dimension with h`n (we use λ = 0.7 in all experiments).",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"Then, the `-th hidden feature of model m with sharing (`− 1)-th hidden features is defined as follows:

Figure 2(d) illustrates the proposed feature sharing scheme in an ensemble of deep neural networks.,4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
It makes each model learn more generalized features by sharing the features among them.,4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"However, one might expect that it might make each model overfitted due to the increased number of parameters that induces a single prediction, i.e., the statistical dependencies among outputs of models increase, which would hurt the ensemble effect.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"In order to handle this issue, we introduce the randomness in sharing across models in a similar manner to DropOut (Srivastava et al., 2014) using the random binary masks σ .",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"In addition, we propose sharing features at lower layers since sharing the higher layers might overfit the overall networks more.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"For example, in all experiments with CNNs in this paper, we commonly apply feature sharing for hidden features just before the first pooling layer.",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"We also remark that such feature sharing strategies for better generalization have also been investigated in the literature for different purposes (Misra et al., 2016; Rusu et al., 2016).",4.1. Feature Sharing,[0],[0]
"For more efficiency in minimizing the confident oracle loss, we also consider a noisy unbiased estimator of gradients of the KL divergence with Monte Carlo samples from the uniform distribution.",4.2. Stochastic Labeling,[0],[0]
"The KL divergence from the predictive distribution to the uniform distribution can be written as follows:
DKL (U (y) ‖",4.2. Stochastic Labeling,[0],[0]

"w − 1

This random estimator takes samples from the uniform distribution U (y) and constructs estimates of the gradient using them.,4.2. Stochastic Labeling,[0],[0]

"The SVHN dataset consists of 73,257 training and 26,032 test images.2 We pre-process the images with global contrast normalization and ZCA whitening following (Ian J. Goodfellow & Bengio, 2013; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), and do not use any data augmentation.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"Using these datasets, we train various CNNs, e.g., VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015), GoogLeNet",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]

"For evaluation, we measure the top-1 and oracle error rates on the test dataset.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
The top-1 error rate is calculated by averaging output probabilities from all models and predicting the class of the highest probability.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]

"While a lower oracle error rate suggests higher diversity, a lower oracle error rate does not always bring a higher top-1 accuracy as this metric does not reveal the level of overconfidence of each model.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"By collectively measuring the top-1 and oracle error rates, one can grasp the level of specialization and confidence of a model.
",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
Contribution by each technique.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
Table 1 validates contributions of our suggested techniques under comparison with other ensemble methods IE and MCL.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
We evaluate an ensemble of five simple CNN models where each model has two convolutional layers followed by a fully-connected layer.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
We incrementally apply our optimizations to gauge the stepwise improvement by each component.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
One can note that CMCL significantly outperforms MCL in the top1 error rate even without feature sharing or stochastic labeling while it still provides a comparable oracle error rate.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"By sharing the 1st ReLU activated features, the top-1 error rates are improved compared to those that employ only confident oracle loss.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
Stochastic labeling further improves both error rates.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"This implies that stochastic labeling not only reduces computational burdens but also provides regularization effects.
",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
Overlapping.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"As a natural extension of CMCL, we also consider picking K specialized models instead of having only one specialized model, which was investigated for original MCL (Guzman-Rivera et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2016).",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"This is easily achieved by modifying the constraint (3b) as ∑M m=1 v m i = K, where K is an overlap parameter that controls training data overlap between the models.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
This simple but natural scheme brings extra gain in top-1 performance by generalizing each model better.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"Table 2 compares the performance of various ensemble methods with varying values of K. Under the choice of K = 4, CMCL of 10 CNNs provides 9.13% relative reduction in the top-1 error rates from the corresponding IE.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"Somewhat interestingly, IE has similar error rates on ensembles of both 5 and 10 CNNs, which implies that the performance of CMCL might be impossible to achieve using IE even if one increases the number of models in IE.
",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
Large-scale CNNs.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"We now evaluate the performance of our ensemble method when it is applied to larger-scale CNN models for image classification tasks on CIFAR-10
and SVHN datasets.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we test VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015), GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), and ResNet (He et al., 2016).",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"We share the nonlinear activated features right before the first pooling layer, i.e., the 6th, 2nd, and 1st ReLU activations for ResNet with 20 layers, VGGNet with 17 layers, and GoogLeNet with 18 layers, respectively.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
This choice is for maximizing the regularization effect of feature sharing while minimizing the statistical dependencies among the ensemble models.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"For all models, we choose the best hyperparameters for confident oracle loss among the penalty parameter β ∈ {0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5} and the overlapping parameter K ∈ {2, 3, 4}.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows that CMCL consistently outperforms all baselines with respect to the top-1 error rate while producing comparable oracle error rates to those of MCL.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
We also apply the feature sharing to IE as reported in Figure 4(a).,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"Even though the feature sharing also improves the performance of IE, CMCL still outperforms IE: CMCL provides 6.11% relative reduction of the top-1
error rate from the IE with feature sharing under the choice of M = 10.",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"We also remark that IE with feature sharing has similar error rates as the ensemble size increases, while CMCL does not (i.e., the gain is more significant for CMCL).",5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
This implies that feature sharing is more effectively working for CMCL.,5.1. Image Classification,[0],[0]
"In this section, we evaluate if ensemble models trained with CMCL produce high-quality segmentation of foreground and background of an image with the iCoseg dataset.",5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]

"For each class, we randomly split 80% and 20% of the data into training and test sets, respectively.",5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]
"We train on 75 × 125 resized images using the bicubic interpolation (Keys, 1981).",5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]

"The top-1 error rate is measured by following the predictions of the member model that has a lower pixel-wise entropy, i.e., picking the output of a more confident model.",5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]
"For each ensemble method, we vary the number of ensemble models and measure the oracle error rate and test error rate.",5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]
Figure 4(b) and 4(c) show both top-1 and oracle error rates for all ensemble methods.,5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]
We remark that the ensemble models trained by CMCL consistently improves the top-1 error rate over baselines.,5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]
"In an ensemble of 5 models, we find that CMCL achieve up to 6.77% relative reduction
in the top-1 error rate from the corresponding IE.",5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 3, an individual model trained by CMCL generates high-quality solutions by specializing itself in specific images (e.g., model 1 is specialized for ‘lobster’",5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]
while model 2 is specialized for ‘duck’) while each model trained by IE does not.,5.2. Foreground-Background Segmentation,[0],[0]

"Complex evaluation metrics for binary classification are best described as set metrics, or non-decomposable metrics – as, in general, the evaluation for a set of predictions cannot be decomposed into the average of individual instance evaluations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

The PU approach has strongest roots in classical statistical analysis which often deals with asymptotically optimal estimation.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"Thus, the consistent ETU classifier is one which optimizes the expected prediction error over test sets of a pre-defined size.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Consistency Analysis for Binary Classification Revisited,title,[0],[0]
Competitive analysis of online algorithms has been an area of spirited research with beautiful results over the past two decades.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"At its heart, this area is about decision making under uncertainty about the future—the input is revealed in an online manner, and at every point in time the algorithm must make an irrevocable choice.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A standard example is that of caching algorithms—at every time step the algorithm must make a choice about which elements to keep in the cache, and which elements to evict (Fiat et al., 1991).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

The key metric in online algorithms is the competitive ratio.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"It measures the quality of the solution obtained by an online algorithm versus an offline optimum, which has the luxury of seeing the whole input before making any decisions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In situations where the competitive ratio is relatively small, for example, the list update problem (Sleator & Tarjan, 1985), this is a great measure by which we can compare different algorithms.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, in some scenarios strong lower bounds on the competitive ratio imply that any algorithm that makes irrevocable choices will necessarily perform poorly when compared to an offline optimum.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Online clustering is one such example.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this setting points x1, x2, . . .",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"arrive one at a time, and must be instantly given one of k cluster labels.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As is typical, the goal is to have the highest quality clustering (under some pre-specified objective function, like k-CENTER or k-MEDIAN) at every point in time.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As Liberty et al. (2016) showed, not only do online clustering algorithms have an unbounded competitive ratio, but one must use bi-criteria approximations to have any hope of a constant approximate solution.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Another approach to evade strong lower bounds is to make additional assumptions about the input to the problem.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, one may assume that the input comes in a random (or partially random) order.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This assumption has been a fruitful avenue when studying online problems in different contexts, as the classic secretary problem (Ferguson, 1989; Kesselheim et al., 2015; Kleinberg, 2005) or matching (Karp et al., 1990; Mahdian & Yan, 2011).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Another alternative is to assume some additional structure on the distribution that points are coming from (Feldman et al., 2009).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A big downside of both of these assumptions is that they are hard to test and validate in practice, which is why we take a different approach in this work.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the irrevocability of past choices makes sense from a theoretical standpoint, for some practical problems this requirement is unrealistically draconian.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"For example, consider a load balancer, which, when faced with requests arriving online, assigns them to different machines.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"Better cache performance dictates that similar requests should be
assigned to the same machine, thus the load balancer is essentially performing online clustering.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"However, fundamentally, nothing is preventing the load balancer from reassigning some of the past jobs to other machines.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"In this situation, a re-clustering—a reassignment of jobs to machines to increase performance—is not an impossible operation.
",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"Another common example of a costly, but not prohibitive recomputation comes from standard applications of unsupervised clustering: feature engineering for large scale machine learned systems.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"In this setting a feature vector x, is augmented with the id of a cluster it falls in, x′, and the full vector (x, x′) is given as input to the learner.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
This is mainly done to introduce expressiveness and non-linearity to simple systems.,1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"In this situation, changing the clustering would entail changing the set of features passed to the learner, and retraining the whole system; thus one certainly does not want to do it at every time step, but it can be done if the gains are worthwhile.
",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"From a theoretical perspective, the ability to correct for past mistakes offers the ability for much better solutions.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"In particular for clustering problems, it avoids the lower bounds introduced by Liberty et al. (2016).",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"As we will show, the option to recluster dramatically improves the quality of the solution, even if it is taken rarely.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"More formally, we will introduce a parameter β which controls the number of times the solution changes.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"Setting β = 0 is equivalent to online algorithms, whereas a large value of β is equivalent to recomputing the answer from scratch at every time step.",1.1. Consistency,[0],[0]
"In this paper we focus on exploring the trade-off between the approximation ratio of clustering algorithms, and the number of times we must recompute the results.

"We begin by formally defining the notion of (α, β)consistent clustering in Section 3.",1.2. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"Then we prove a lower bound, showing that any constant competitive algorithm must change its cluster centers at least Ω(k log n) times (Section 3.1).",1.2. Our Contributions,[0],[0]
"Then we show that a known algorithm by Charikar et al. (2004) achieves this bound for the kCENTER problem, and we develop a new algorithm for other clustering objectives, and show that it requires at most O(k2 log4 n) reclusterings, an exponential improvement over the naive solution (Section 5).",1.2.

",5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]
"The first is the Meyerson sketch for online facility location (Meyerson, 2001).",5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]
This sketch has already been used by Charikar et al. (2003) to solve the k-median problem on data streams.,5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]
"We show that the main ingredients of the sketch continue to work under costp objectives, and use it to generally reduce the number of points under considerations from n to k · poly log n.
One caveat of this sketch is that to use it we need to have access to a good lower bound on the cost of the optimal solution at any point in time.",5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]
We obtain it by running the Θ(p) approximation algorithm described by Gupta & Tangwongsan (2008) on all available points.,5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]

"Then we divide the progress of our algorithm into log n phases based on this lower bound and in each phase we use a different sketch.
",5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]
"Finally, while the Meyerson sketch maintains O(k log2 n) possible centers, to computer the k-clustering, we have to reduce these points into exactly k final centers.",5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]
We first show that this is possible and then we prove that we do not need to recluster frequently.,5.1. Main ideas,[0],[0]

",5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
Proof.,5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
"As mentioned above, Lemma 5.1 implies that if we construct 2 log n single Meyerson sketches in parallel, with probability 1 − O(n−1), at least one of them gives a constant approximation to the optimum at every point in time.",5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
Furthermore in total it contains only 4k(1 + log n),5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
"( 22p+1 γp + 1 ) points.
",5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
Now in Algorithm 2 we are almost building 2 log n Meyerson sketches; the only difference is that we stop adding points to a single sketch when it becomes too large.,5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
This modification does not change the probability that there exist at least one single sketch that gives a constant approximation to the optimum at every point in time and has at most 4k(1 + log n),5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
"( 22p+1 γp + 1 ) points.
",5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
Thus with probability 1 − O(n−1) at least one of the sketches constructed in Lemma 5.1 gives a constant approximation to the optimum at every point in time.,5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
Merging other sketches to this sketch does not affect this property.,5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]
Furthermore the number of points in each sketch is explicitly bounded by 4k(1 + log n),5.2. The Meyerson sketch,[0],[0]

The algorithm,[0],[0]
"Note that every time we change the centers, we fully recluster, and so increase the consistency factor by k in the worst case.",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
"Therefore to prove the theorem we need to show that one of these conditions is met at most O(k log4 n) times.
",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
"From our assumptions we know that the spread of the point set is polynomial in n, which implies the same bound on the cost of the optimum solution.",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the cost of the solution computed by A doubles at most O(log n) times.
",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
"For the same reason we update the lower bounds, φ at most O(log n) times during the execution of our algorithm.",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]

"Furthermore each Meyerson sketch has at most O(k log n) centers, thus in total we can add at most O(k log3 n) points under condition (ii).
",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
"Finally note that while a Meyerson sketch is fixed, the weight of every point in the sketch can only grow.",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
"In addition, the weight is always is bounded by n, and therefore can double at most log n times per sketch point, resulting in O(k log2 n) changes under a fixed Meyerson sketch.",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
Therefore condition (iii) holds at most O(k log4 n) times.,5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
"So overall at least one of the conditions is satisfied at most O(k log4 n) times, thus the algorithm is O(k2 log4 n)-consistent.
",5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
To finish our proof we need to show that at any point in time our algorithm returns with probability 1−o(n−1) a constant approximation to the optimum.,5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
Note that by corollary 5.5 we know that for any constant p ≥ 1 the cost of a solution computed on the Meyerson sketch can be bounded by costp(c ′) ≤ 23p−1 ( costM + optp ) .,5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]
From Lemma 5.2 we know that the Meyerson sketch guarantees with probability 1− o(n−1) that costM ≤ 16optp(X).,5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]

It remains to get a bound on costL. Note that the number of points assigned to any point in M did not double since the previous reclustering.,5.4. The algorithm,[0],[0]

"For each of the datasets we try values of k in {10, 50, 100}, and observe that the qualitative results are consistent across datasets and values of k.
Algorithm Modifications In the development of the algorithm we made a number of decisions to obtain high probability results.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The key among them was to run O(log n) copies of the Meyerson sketch, since each sketch succeeds only with constant probability.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We eschew this change in the implementation, and maintain just a single sketch, at the cost of incurring a worse solution quality.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Metrics and results The goal of this work is to give algorithms that maintain a good clustering, but only recluster judiciously, when necessary.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To that end, we focus on two main metrics: number of reclusterings and solution quality.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
Reclustering We plot the number of reclusterings as a function of time for the three different datasets in Figure 1.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Note that the x-axis is on log-scale, and thus a straight line
represents number of reclusterings that grows logarithmically with time.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Qualitatively we make two observations, across all datasets, and values of k.
First, the rate of reclustering (defined as the fraction of time the algorithm recomputes the solution) is approximately logn/n, which tends to 0 as the dataset size grows.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Further, the rate is higher for higher values of k, a fact also suggested by our theoretical analysis.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Unlike the SHUTTLE and COVERTYPE datasets, the SKINTYPE dataset exhibits a change in behavior, where initially the reclustering rate is relatively high, but then it sharplly drops after about O(2k) steps.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is explained by the fact that the order of the points in this data set is not random.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Therefore initially the algorithm reclusters at a high rate, once all of the parts of the input space are explored, the rate of reclustering slows.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"When we run the algorithm on a randomly permuted instance of SKINTYPE, this phase transition in behavior disappears.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Approximation Ratio We plot the approximation ratio of the solution (as compared to the best obtained by ten runs of k-means++ (Arthur & Vassilvitskii, 2007)) in Figure 2.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the SKIN and COVERTYPE datasets, the approximation ratio stays relatively low, largely bounded by 4, after an initial period.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"A more careful examination of the plots shows exactly the times when the consistent algorithm allows the solution to degrade, and when it decides to recompute the solution from scratch.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The latter are indicated by sharp drops in the approximation ratio, whereas the former are the relatively flat patterns.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"It is interesting to note that the additional points sometimes worsen the approximation (as indicated by the lines sloping upwards), but sometimes actually improve the approximation.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is due to the fact that decisions made by the online algorithm balance optimality at that point in time, with the potential location of points arriving in the future.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The latter is most apparent in the k = 100 experiment of the SHUTTLE dataset.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
All of the datasets sometimes exhibit large fluctuations in the approximation ratio.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is an artifact of using a single Myerson sketch, which does not capture the structure of the points with small, but constant probability.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
We introduced the notion of consistent clustering: a variant of online clustering which balances the need for maintaining an approximately optimal solution with the cost of reclustering.,8. Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We proved Ω(klog n) lower bounds, and gave algorithms for all k-clustering variants that come close to achieving this bound.
",8. Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
The notion of quantifying the worst case number of changes necessary to maintain a constant approximate solution in an online setting is interesting to study in contexts other than k-clustering.,8. Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
"For example, one can consider online graph problems, such as online matching and online densest subgraph, or other types of clustering problems, such as hierarchical or correlation clustering.",8. Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
The study of online algorithms and competitive analysis provides a solid foundation for studying the quality of irrevocable decision making when the data arrives in an online manner.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"While in some scenarios the decisions are indeed irrevocable, there are many practical situations when changing a previous decision is not impossible, but simply expensive.",abstractText,[0],[0]
In this work we formalize this notion and introduce the consistent k-clustering problem.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"With points arriving online, the goal is to maintain a constant approximate solution, while minimizing the number of reclusterings necessary.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We prove a lower bound, showing that Ω(k log n) changes are necessary in the worst case for a wide range of objective functions.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"On the positive side, we give an algorithm that needs onlyO(k log n) changes to maintain a constant competitive solution, an exponential improvement on the naive solution of reclustering at every time step.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Finally, we show experimentally that our approach performs much better than the theoretical bound, with the number of changes growing approximately as O(log n).",abstractText,[0],[0]

Konidaris et al. (2011) suggested a statistical interpretation of TD(λ).,6.1. Statistical Interpretation of TD(λ),[0],[0]
"They show that under several assumptions the TD(λ) estimate Rλst is the maximum likelihood estimator of V (st) given Rnst : (1) Each R n st is an unbiased estimator of V (st); (2) The random variables Rnst are independent and specifically uncorrelated; (3) The random variables Rnst are jointly normally distributed; and (4) The variance of each Rnst is proportional to λ n.
Under Assumptions 1-3 the maximum likelihood estimator of V (s) given its previous estimate can be represented as a linear convex combination of Rnst with weights:

"then V π(s) ≡ 0.
",6.5. Approximation Hardness,[0],[0]
• In the chain MDP example in Section 4 we saw that ρd(s) is an exponential function of the location in the chain.,6.5. Approximation Hardness,[0],[0]
Setting reward in one end to 1 will result in an exponential form for V π(s) as well.,6.5. Approximation Hardness,[0],[0]
"Subsequently, in the chain MDP example approximating log (ρd(s)) is easier than ρd(s) as we obtain a linear function of the position; This is not the general case.",6.5. Approximation Hardness,[0],[0]
We have performed 3 types of experiments.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our first batch of experiments (Figure 1) demonstrates the accuracy of predicting ρd by both COP-TD(λ, β) and Log-COP-TD(λ, β).",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We show two types of setups in which visualization of ρd is relatively clear - the chain MDP example mentioned in Section 4 and the mountain car domain (Sutton and Barto, 1998) in which the state is determined by only two continuous variables - the car’s position and speed.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The parameters λ and β exhibited low sensitivity in these tasks so they were simply set to 0, we show the estimated ρd after 106 iterations.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the chain MDP (top two plots, notice the logarithmic scale) we first approximate ρd without any function approximation (top-left) and we can see COP-TD manages to converge to the correct value while Log-COPTD is much less exact.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
When we use linear feature space (constant parameter and position),7. Experiments,[0],[0]
Log-COP-TD captures the true behavior of ρd much better as expected.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
The two lower plots show the error (in color) in ρd estimated for the mountain car with a pure exploration behavior policy vs. a target policy oriented at moving right.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
The z-axis is the same for both plots and it describes a much more accurate estimate of ρd obtained through simulations.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
The features used were local state aggregation.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We can see that both algorithms succeed similarly on the position-speed pairs which are sampled often due to the behavior policy and the
mountain.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"When looking at more rarely observed states, the estimate becomes worse for both algorithms, though Log-COP-TD seems to be better performing on the spike at position > 0.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Next we test the sensitivity of COP-TD(λ, β) and LogCOP-TD(λ,β) to the parameters β and γlog (Figure 2) on two distinct toy examples - the chain MDP introduced before but with only 30 states with the position-linear features, and a random MDP with 32 states, 2 actions and a 5-bit binary feature vector along with a free parameter (this compact representation was suggested by White and White (2016) to approximate real world problems).",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The policies on the chain MDP were taken as described before, and on the random MDP a state independent 0.75/0.25 probability to choose an action by the behavior/target policy.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As we can see, larger values of β cause noisier estimations in the random MDP for COP-TD(λ, β), but has little effect in other venues.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As for γlog - we can see that if it is too large or too small the error behaves sub-optimally, as expected for the crude approximation of Equation 5.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In conclusion, unlike ETD(λ, β), Log/COP-TD(λ, β) are much less effected by β, though γlog should be tuned to improve results.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our final experiment (Figure 3) compares our algorithms to ETD(λ, β) and GTD(λ, β) over 4 setups: chain MDP with 100 states with right half rewards 1 with linear features, a 2 action random MDP with 256 states and binary features, acrobot (3 actions) and cart-pole balancing (21 actions) (Sutton and Barto, 1998) with reset at success and state aggregation to 100 states.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In all problems we used the same features for ρd and V π(s) estimation, γ = 0.99, constant step size 0.05 for the TD process and results were averaged over 10 trajectories, other parameters (λ, β, other step sizes, γlog) were swiped over to find the best ones.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To
reduce figure clutter we have not included standard deviations though the noisy averages still reflect the variance in the process.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our method of comparison on the first 2 setups estimates the value function using the suggested algorithm, and finds the dπ weighted average of the error between V and the on-policy fixed point ΠπTVπ:
‖V̂ −ΠπTVπ‖2dπ = ∑ s dπ(s) [ (θ∗ − θ̂)>φ(s) ]2 ,
where θ∗ is the optimal θ obtained by on-policy TD using the target policy.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"On the latter continuous state problems we applied on-line TD on a different trajectory following the target policy, used the resulting θ value as ground truth and taken the sum of squared errors with respect to it.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
The behavior and target policies for the chain MDP and random MDP are as specified before.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the acrobot problem the behavior policy is uniform over the 3 actions and the target policy chooses between these with probabilities ( 16 , 1 3 , 1 2 ).",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the cart-pole the action space is divided to 21 actions from -1 to 1 equally, the behavior policy chooses among these uniformly while the target policy is 1.5 times more prone to choosing a positive action than a negative one.
",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The experiments show that COP-TD(λ, β) and Log-COPTD(λ, β) have comparable performance to ETD(λ, β) where at least one is better in every setup.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
The advantage in the new algorithms is especially seen in the chain MDP corresponding to a large discrepancy between the stationary distribution of the behavior and target policy.,7. Experiments,[0],[0]
"GTD(λ) is consistently worse on the tested setups, this might be due to the large difference between the chosen behavior and target policies which affects GTD(λ) the most.",7. Experiments,[0],[0]
Research on off-policy evaluation has flourished in the last decade.,8. Conclusion,[0],[0]
"While a plethora of algorithms were suggested so far, ETD(λ, β) by Hallak et al. (2015) has perhaps the simplest formulation and theoretical properties.",8. Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, ETD(λ, β) does not converge to the same point achieved by on-line TD when linear function approximation is applied.
",8. Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We address this issue with COP-TD(λ,β) and proved it can achieve consistency when used with a correct set of features, or at least allow trading-off some of the bias by adding or removing features.",8. Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Despite requiring a new set of features and calibrating an additional update function, COP-TD(λ,β)’s performance does not depend as much on β as ETD(λ,β), and shows promising empirical results.
",8. Conclusion,[0],[0]
We offer a connection to the statistical interpretation of TD(λ) that motivates our entire formulation.,8. Conclusion,[0],[0]
This interpretation leads to two additional approaches: (a) weight the Γnt using estimated variances instead of β exponents and (b) approximating log[ρd] instead of ρd; both approaches deserve consideration when facing a real application.,8. Conclusion,[0],[0]

One solution to this issue is to supply the annotator with more information about the user.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, for the similar task of classifying a Twitter user’s political affiliation, Cohen and Ruths (2013) display the user’s last 10 tweets.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Nguyen et al. (2013), studying gender and age, ask annotators to label users by leveraging all information available in their profile.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, while scholars routinely make such decisions about what information to show annotators, they rarely examine how such decisions actually impact annotations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The first contribution of this paper (Section 3) is to show that, at least for political stance detection on Twitter, displaying different kinds of context to annotators yields significantly different annotations for the same user.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result of these discrepancies, the accuracy of models trained on these annotations varies widely.

"While it is possible one could select a “best” context for a given task, our results suggest that doing so a priori is difficult and that, moreover, different contexts provide complementary information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Like Raykar et al. (2010), who find that even lowquality annotators are useful, we find that lowquality contexts can be useful.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Furthermore, the model provides an unsupervised method for comparing the information conditions by examining their respective error patterns.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, ConStance performs a role analogous to boosting for annotations: for an arbitrary task, it permits collection of labels that capture different aspects of the instances at hand, then combines them automatically to determine which are more reliable and to produce a classifier that takes all this into account.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Further, while tweets were annotated with respect to different targets, we combine all annotations into a single task by assuming that “anti-
Trump” means “pro-Clinton”, and vice-versa.",2.3 Annotation Task,[0],[0]
"This assumption seems reasonable given that the voting population was strongly polarized during the general (post-primary) election season, and it doubles the amount of data we can use to train the models.",2.3 Annotation Task,[0],[0]
"Thus, throughout this work the labels we use are taken from the set {“Support Trump / Oppose Clinton” = −1, “Neutral / I don’t know” = 0, “Oppose Trump / Support Clinton” = 1}.",2.3 Annotation Task,[0],[0]
Each of the 562 “anchor” tweets was annotated under six different contexts (also referred to as information conditions) described in Table 1.,2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
(The Supplementary Material provides visual examples of each.),2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
We collected at least three annotations for each tweet/condition pair.,2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
"Every AMT worker was shown 40 different tweets, one by one, randomly distributed across contexts.",2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
"Two additional artificial tweets were used to control for task competency.
",2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
We selected the conditions in Table 1 based on two factors.,2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
"First, we included conditions that varied in how much we expected them to impact annotations.",2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
"For example, we expected the partial profile information to have a relatively small effect, and political party a larger one.",2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
"Second, we restricted our options to sets of information that we believed would minimally impact task completion times.",2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
"We confirmed this empirically by regressing the (logged) time to completion for each annotator on the number of tweets she saw for each context, finding no significant effects from any context.",2.4 Contexts Studied,[0],[0]
"Ideally, we would evaluate annotation quality and downstream performance by comparing to ground truth.",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, ground truth is difficult to
characterize for tasks as subjective as stance detection or sentiment analysis (Passonneau and Carpenter, 2014; DiMaggio, 2015).",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"In light of this, we constructed our own labels, using all available information about users, and we use them as an approximation of ground truth.
",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"We constructed these labels in order to evaluate downstream classification performance, and they cover a set of users not shown to the AMT workers.",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"Given our resource constraints and the numerous (at least 18), often conflicting labels already available for tweets shown to AMT workers, we did not create definitive labels for that set.
",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"To create these “gold standard” (GS) labels, we considered all information found on the user’s Twitter timeline, including everything AMT annotators could see, plus friend/following relationships, all of their previous tweets, demographics from the voter file, etc.",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"Anecdotally, we found certain cases time-consuming to investigate, which argues for continuing to limit how much information we ask annotators to consider.",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"All gold standard labels were agreed upon by at least two authors, who first labeled the data independently and then came together to discuss disagreements.
",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
Our GS set consists of 318 users (with their associated anchor tweets).,2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
Each user is assigned a label from the tertiary Trump/Neutral/Clinton scale.,2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
Another 250 manually labeled accounts were used for model development but are not part of reported results.,2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
"The GS is approximately equally divided among registered Democrats, registered Republicans, and people not registered with either party; the last category includes selfdeclared Independents and voters not affiliated with any party.",2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]
We include this third set in order to ensure the models generalize beyond registered Democrats and Republicans.,2.5 Gold Standard Labels,[0],[0]

"For sentiment, we compute various scores from the anchor tweet alone.","3.1 Classifier, Labels, Features, & Evaluation",[0],[0]
"For user features, we include the user’s race and gender, which annotators might have learned from the user’s profile picture.","3.1 Classifier, Labels, Features, & Evaluation",[0],[0]

"Classifier performance on the GS is measured, following prior work (Mohammad et al., 2016a; Ebrahimi et al., 2016), on the average of the F1 scores on the two classes of interest (“Clinton” and “Trump”).","3.1 Classifier, Labels, Features, & Evaluation",[0],[0]
"Additionally, we report the average log-loss (the negative log-likelihood, according to the classifier, of the true label).","3.1 Classifier, Labels, Features, & Evaluation",[0],[0]

"Before evaluating classification results, we consider annotator agreement within each context, calculated like Mohammad et al. (2016b) as the average, across tweets, of the percentage of annotations that match the majority vote.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"As shown in Table 3, annotators shown No Context achieve an agreement score of 0.84, similar to the 0.8185 reported by Mohammad et al. (2016b).",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"Relative to this baseline, some contexts increase agreement more than others.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"As one might expect, Previous Political Tweets and Political Party show the strongest signals.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"Their effects are statistically (p < .01, Mann-Whitney test) and practically significant, increasing the number of labels having full agreement by 15% and 10%, respectively.
",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"However, annotators shown different contexts did not necessarily converge to the same labels.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
Notice the low agreement for the All Combined condition: the majority labels held stronger majorities within any individual context than across all of them.,3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"In fact, if we look at the six majority vote labels for each tweet, only in 43% of the tweets are these labels in full agreement.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"At the end of Section 5, we return to the question of why agreement was so low across conditions, with the help of parameters estimated by ConStance.
",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"In the classification task, the results in Table 3 further suggest that Previous Political Tweets
serves as the strongest single context.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"There is a good case to be made for choosing this individual context, which is statistically significantly better than many others.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"For example, providing annotators with Previous Political Tweets provides a statistically significant increase in both average F1 scores and log-loss (with p < .01) over both the No Context and Full Profile conditions.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"Perhaps most noteworthy is that the All Combined classifier, created from the naive combination of all annotations, is no better than the classifiers from the individual conditions.
",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"To summarize, results suggest that providing annotators with appropriate additional context can improve annotation quality, as measured via annotator agreement and downstream classification performance.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"However, it was not obvious in advance which context would be most helpful, and performing such an analysis as this requires the time-intensive construction of better “gold standard” labels against which to check the labels already being outsourced to annotators.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
"In addition, the heterogeneity of the labels produced in different contexts suggests that the contexts provide diverse signals we might be able to leverage; however, simply combining all the annotations does not result in improvements.",3.2 Effects of the Contexts,[0],[0]
The prior section thus suggests that it may be better to limit a priori decisions and instead to leverage multiple kinds of context during annotation.,4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
Like Raykar et al.,4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
"(2010) assumes for annotators, we might expect (and indeed find) that even those contexts that turn out to be worse on some metrics still might be useful for other purposes.",4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
"Here, we present a model for such an approach.
",4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
ConStance learns a classifier for items.,4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
"For our purposes here, an item is a user together with their anchor tweet and the additional information from which features were derived (see Table 2); more broadly, it is whatever we choose to put into the feature vector.",4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
"One could choose a differ-
ent setup; for example, an item could be a user and ten anchor tweets.",4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
"However, the current arrangement allows for straightforward comparison to prior stance work on Twitter (Mohammad et al., 2016a).
",4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
"Note that in general, the features need not be restricted to those annotators could have seen.",4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
"Rather, they could include anything useful to a classifier.",4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
Note also that the feature set provided to ConStance is the same used by the baseline models; only the models themselves differ.,4 ConStance: General Unified Model,[0],[0]
The model we develop is shown in Figure 1.,4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
There are N items to be labeled.,4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
Each item can be viewed in up toC different contexts.,4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Finally, there are A total annotators labeling the items; each annotator sees multiple items.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Each item can have a different number of annotations, produced by any assignment of annotators and information conditions to items.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"In our dataset, every item is labeled
in 6 conditions (every |Ci| = 6), and within every context, every item is labeled by at least 3 annotators (every |Aci | ≥ 3).
",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
The model’s generative story works as follows.,4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
Item i has feature vector Xi and a “true” label Yi ∈ V .,4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"The relationship between Xi and Yi can be described by some model M, which we will ultimately learn.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"When the item is viewed with context c, the item’s true label Yi is transformed by noise into a “context-specific” label Sci ∈ V .",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"In other words, the true label may appear differently when seen through the lens of each context.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"The variable Sci represents what an ideal annotator would say about item i given only as much information as is preserved by context c.
The “noise” introduced by context c is described by parameter γc.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
The parameter γc is a V × V matrix of transition probabilities from true labels to context-specific labels.,4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"These probabilities depend only on Yi and γc, not on the item’s features Xi.
",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Importantly, annotators themselves are also imperfect.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"When annotator a sees item i, she may also distort the label she sees, Sci , into the observed annotation Rcai ∈ V .",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"The annotator-specific noise process is described by parameter αa, another V × V transition matrix.
",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"For a better understanding of the role of γc (and by anology, αa), consider the depictions in Figure 2.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
The matrix on the top left refers to the No Context condition.,4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"Its top row describes what an annotator with perfect judgment would think about a user whose true label is Trump [supporter], with no context.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]
"The top left cell, with a value around 0.65, is the probability the annotator would think Trump; the lighter middle cell, with a value around 0.35, is the probability she would think Neutral/Don’t know; and the probability she would think Clinton is almost 0.",4.1 Overview,[0],[0]

"For α, a similar derivation yields the following update to αasr: the weighted number of labels by annotator a, in any context, having Sci = s and R ca i = r, divided by the weighted number of labels by annotator a, in any context, having Sci = s.",4.2 Learning,[0],[0]
The top portion of Table 5 displays ConStance’s performance compared to the best results from Section 3.,5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Using the same experimental setup as Section 3—the model type and features, M and X respectively, are the same as in the baselines— ConStance improves over the best baseline models for each metric.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
This improvement is statistically significant for both metrics (at the p < .05 level for log-loss).,5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Further, the model converges rapidly, within 5-7 iterations of the EM algorithm and 3-5 minutes on a single machine.2
In addition to comparing to the baselines provided in Section 3, we investigate which information the model is leveraging to be successful.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
We do so by exploring three ablations of the model.,5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Variation #1 (“Only Political Tweets” in Table 5)
",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"2As above, a development set is used for coarse hyperparameter tuning; see the Supplementary Material for details.
uses the full model, but only gives it the annotations from the Political Tweets condition.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"This tests whether simply modeling differences in annotators’ error rates, as Raykar et al. (2010) do, with a single (“best”) context is helpful.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"We find that it is: the performance of this variation is significantly better on both metrics than the Political Tweets baseline from Table 3.
",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In the second and third variations, we check whether the effectiveness of ConStance stems from modeling differences between annotators rather than differences in contexts, or vice versa.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Variation #2 (“Context Labels Masked”), like #1, models only annotator effects; however, it instead uses the entire set of annotations, treating them as if from a single context (i.e., “masking” context information from the model).",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Variation #3 (“Annotator Labels Masked”) is the complement of Variation #2: it models differences in contexts, and it uses the entire set of annotations, treating them as if from a single annotator.
",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
The results of the model ablation experiments are three-fold.,5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"First, we see that each piece of the model on its own is effective in moving beyond baseline approaches that use only one context or naively combine labels across contexts and annotators (the “All Combined” baseline).",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
All model variations achieve significantly higher Avg.,5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"F1 than the baselines, and Variations #1 and #2 improve on log-loss.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Second, we see that modeling annotators alone is clearly better than not: not only does Variation #1 outperform the Political Tweets baseline (significantly), but also Variation #2 outperforms the All Combined baseline (significantly) and ConStance outperforms Variation #3 (with significance in one measure).",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Finally, the best results come from using the full model.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Even if the differences between ConStance and the variations are not all statistically significant, modeling both annotators and contexts appears to be the most complete and effective approach.
",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In addition to model performance, we can also examine what ConStance has learned about the quality of labels from each context.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Recall that the model produces a parameter matrix for each context, γc, which describes how a context distorts the “true” labels the model assumes.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Each γc is a transition matrix, so a context that perfectly preserves true labels would show up as the identity matrix; off-diagonal entries show error patterns.

"We see that in the No Context, Partial Profile and Full Profile conditions, annotators often selected the “Neutral” option (x-axis) when the model inferred the true label was “Clinton” or “Trump” (yaxis).",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"This finding is in line with intuitions; annotators who saw these conditions simply lacked enough information to determine any label.
",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"On the other extreme, in the Political Party context, annotators selected “Trump” or “Clinton” too often when the model settled on the “Neutral” option.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"That is, even when a user’s stance was not clear to annotators in other conditions, annotators who saw political party still inferred stance from the text.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Here, one could argue annotators were shown “too much” or “too strong” a context—they saw stance even where the content produced by the user did not suggest one.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Indeed, further manual inspection of 90 tweets on which annotations disagreed across contexts implies that annotators who saw political affiliation were often wrong because they focused too little on text content relative to the provided political affiliations.
",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In presenting these findings, a key point to highlight is that unlike the results of Section 3, Figure 2 was produced without access to any full information labels, which depend on a significant level of manual effort beyond annotations gathered on AMT.",5 Model Results and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Recent work has shown that cognitive biases such as stereotypes (Carpenter et al., 2016) and anchoring (Berzak et al., 2016) can negatively impact text annotation and resulting models, even for objective tasks like POS tagging (Blodgett et al., 2016).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Still, researchers often decide what context to show annotators without rigorously evalu-
ating how their decisions will affect annotations, on tasks from gender identification to political leanings (Chen et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2014; Burger et al., 2011; Cohen and Ruths, 2013).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work suggests an interesting avenue of development towards reducing annotation bias by explicitly modeling it and reducing the need for a priori decisions on which context is best for which particular task.
",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In doing so, we draw on a large body of work around improving annotation quality for NLP data.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work aligns with efforts to improve task design (e.g. Schneider et al., 2013; Morstatter and Liu, 2016; Schneider, 2015), and to develop better models of annotation.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"With respect to the former and specific to Twitter, Frankenstein et al. (2016) show that for the task of labeling the sentiment of reply tweets, annotations vary depending on whether or not the original tweet (being replied to) is also shown.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"With respect to the latter, several recent models beyond Raykar et al. (2010) have been proposed (Guan et al., 2017; Tian and Zhu, 2012; Wauthier and Jordan, 2011; Passonneau and Carpenter, 2014).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, our work is most similar to efforts outside the domain of NLP, where Dai et al. (2013) have developed a method of switching between task workflows based on annotation quality for particular items, and Nguyen et al. (2016) have developed a Bayesian model similar to ours to study annotation quality for other kinds of slightly subjective tasks.
",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In a closely related vein, recent work has also considered how text annotations may vary in important ways based on the characteristics of annotators (rather than how the task is posed, as we study here)",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"(Sen et al., 2015).",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
An interesting avenue of future work is to understand the intersection between the design of NLP annotation tasks and the characteristics of the annotating population.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
Annotated data serves as a foundational layer for many NLP tasks.,7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"While some annotation tasks only require information from short texts, in many others, we can elicit higher-quality labels by providing annotators with additional contextual information.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"However, asking annotators to consider too much information would make their task slow and burdensome.
",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper we demonstrate how exposing an-
notators to short contextual information leads to better labels and better classification results.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"However, different contexts lead to results of different quality, and it is not obvious a priori which context is best, nor—even given ground truth—how to combine labels produced across contexts to exploit the information present in each.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We then propose ConStance, a generalizable model that learns the effects of both individual contexts and individual annotators on the labeling process.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"The model infers (probability estimates for) ground truth labels, plus learns a classifier that can be applied to new instances.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"We show that this classifier significantly improves classification of political stance compared to the standard practice of training models on majority vote labels.
",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"The focus of this work is on improving both the annotation process for nuanced, contextdependent tasks and the use of the resulting labels.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"While ConStance’s label estimation can be used in conjunction with any classification method, this paper does not address the optimization of the classifier itself.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Thus, while we consider an assortment of contexts and use a rich feature representation, using additional contexts or different features may lead to better performance on stance detection.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, the model is versatile enough we could consider treating different tweets as different “contexts” for the same user, augmenting the extensively annotated tweets with other types of data, and, naturally, applying the same framework to other annotation tasks.",7 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
Manual annotations are a prerequisite for many applications of machine learning.,abstractText,[0],[0]

"First, we describe a method to linearize a tree into a sequence of labels (§2) of the same length of the sentence minus one.2 The label generated for each word encodes the number of common ancestors in the constituent tree between that word and the next, and the nonterminal symbol associated with the lowest common ancestor.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Then, we can reduce the constituent parsing problem to a sequence labeling task where the goal is to predict a function F|w|,θ : V

"To parse a sentence, we label it and then decode the resulting label sequence into a constituent tree, i.e., we apply F|w|,θ ◦ Φ−1|w|.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the method to be correct, we need the encoding of trees to be complete (every tree in T|w| must be expressible as a label sequence, i.e., Φ|w| must be a function, so we have full coverage of constituent trees) and injective (so that the inverse function Φ−1|w| is well-defined).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Surjectivity is also desirable, so that the inverse is a function on L|w|−1, and the parser outputs a tree for any sequence of labels that the classifier can generate.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We now define our Φ|w| and show that it is total and injective.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our encoding is not surjective per se.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We handle ill-formed label sequences in §2.3.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Let wi be a word located at position i in the sentence, for 1 ≤ i ≤ |w| − 1.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"We will assign it a 2-tuple label li = (ni, ci), where: ni is an integer that encodes the number of common ancestors between wi and wi+1, and ci is the nonterminal symbol at the lowest common ancestor.
",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Basic encodings The number of common ancestors may be encoded in several ways.
1.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Absolute scale: The simplest encoding is to make ni directly equal to the number of ancestors in common between wi and wi+1.
2.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
Relative scale: A second and better variant consists in making ni represent the difference with respect to the number of ancestors encoded in ni−1.,2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Its main advantage is that the size of the label set is reduced considerably.
",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Figure 1 shows an example of a tree linearized according to both absolute and relative scales.
",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Encoding for trees with exactly k children For trees where all branchings have exactly k children, it is possible to obtain a even more efficient linearization in terms of number of labels.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"To do so, we take the relative scale encoding as our starting
point.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"If we build the tree incrementally in a leftto-right manner from the labels, if we find a negative ni, we will need to attach the word wi+1 (or a new subtree with that word as its leftmost leaf) to the (−ni + 2)th node in the path going from wi to the root.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"If every node must have exactly k children, there is only one valid negative value of ni: the one pointing to the first node in said path that has not received its kth child yet.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Any smaller value would leave this node without enough children (which cannot be fixed later due to the leftto-right order in which we build the tree), and any larger value would create a node with too many children.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Thus, we can map negative values to a single label.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows an example for the case of binarized trees (k = 2).
",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Links to root Another variant emerged from the empirical observation that some tokens that are
usually linked to the root node (such as the final punctuation in Figure 1) were particularly difficult to learn for the simpler baselines.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"To successfully deal with these cases in practice, it makes sense to consider a simplified annotation scheme where a node is assigned a special tag (ROOT, ci) when it is directly linked to the root of the tree.
",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"From now on, unless otherwise specified, we use the relative scale without the simplification for exactly k children.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"This will be the encoding used in the experiments (§4), because the size of the label set is significantly lower than the one obtained by relying on the absolute one.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"Also, it works directly with non-binarized trees, in contrast to the encoding that we introduce for trees with exactly k children, which is described only for completeness and possible interest for future work.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
"For the experiments (§4), we also use the special tag (ROOT, ci) to further reduce the size of the label set and to simplify the classification of tokens connected to the root, where |ni| is expected to be large.",2.1 The Encoding,[0],[0]
We now prove that Φ|w| is a total function and injective for any tree in T|w|.,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]

"Completeness Every pair of nodes in a rooted tree has at least one common ancestor, and a unique lowest common ancestor.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]

Injectivity The encoding method must ensure that any given sequence of labels corresponds to exactly one tree.,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Otherwise, we have to deal with ambiguity, which is not desirable.
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"For simplicity, we will prove injectivity in two steps.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"First, we will show that the encoding is injective if we ignore nonterminals (i.e., equivalently, that the encoding is injective for the set of trees resulting from replacing all the nonterminals in trees in T|w| with a generic nonterminal X).",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Then, we will show that it remains injective when we take nonterminals into account.
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"For the first part, let τ ∈",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"T|w| be a tree where
nonterminals take a generic value X .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
We represent the label of the ith leaf node as •i.,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Consider the representation of τ as a bracketed string, where a single-node tree with a node labeled A is represented by (A), and a tree rooted at R with child subtrees C1 . . .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
Cn is represented as (R(C1 . . .,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Cn)).
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
Each leaf node will appear in this string as a substring (•i).,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Thus, the parenthesized string has the form α0(•1)α1(•2) . . .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"α|w|−1(•|w|)αw, where the αis are strings that can only contain brackets and nonterminals, as by construction there can be no leaf nodes between (•i) and (•i+1).
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
We now observe some properties of this parenthesized string.,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"First, note that each of the substrings αi must necessarily be composed of zero or more closing parentheses followed by zero or more opening parentheses with their corresponding nonterminal, i.e., it must be of the form",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"[)]∗[(X]∗. This is because an opening parenthesis followed by a closing parenthesis would represent a leaf node, and there are no leaf nodes between (•i) and (•i+1) in the tree.
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Thus, we can write αi as αi)αi(, where αi) is a string matching the expression [)]∗ and αi( a string matching the expression",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"[(X]∗. With this, we can write the parenthesized string for τ as
α0)α0((•1)α1)α1((•2)α2)α2( . . .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"(•|w|)α|w|)α|w|(.
Let us now denote by βi the string αi−1((•i)αi).",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Then, and taking into account that α0) and αw( are trivially empty in the previous expression due to bracket balancing, the expression for the tree becomes simply β1β2 . . .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"β|w|, where we know, by construction, that each βi is of the form",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"[(X]∗(•i)[)]∗.
Since we have shown that each tree in T|w| uniquely corresponds to a string β1β2 . . .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"β|w|, to show injectivity of the encoding, it suffices to show that different values for a βi generate different label sequences.
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"To show this, we can say more about the form of βi: it must be either of the form [(X]∗(•i) or of the form (•i)[)]∗, i.e., it is not possible that βi contains both opening parenthesis before the leaf node and closing parentheses after the leaf node.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"This could only happen if the tree had a subtree of the form (X(•i)), but this is not possible since we are forbidding unary branches.
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Hence, we can identify each βi with an integer number δ(βi): 0",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"if βi has neither opening nor closing parentheses outside the leaf node,
+k if it has k opening parentheses, and −k if it has k closing parentheses.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
It is easy to see that δ(β1)δ(β2) . . .,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
δ(β|w|−1) corresponds to the values ni in the relative-scale label encoding of the tree τ .,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"To see this, note that the number of unclosed parentheses at the point right after βi in the string exactly corresponds to the number of common ancestors between the ith and (i + 1)th leaf nodes.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
A positive δ(βi),2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"= k corresponds to opening k parentheses before βi, so the number of common ancestors of wi and wi+1 will be k more than that of wi−1 and wi.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
A negative δ(βi),2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"= −k corresponds to closing k parentheses after βi, so the number of common ancestors will conversely decrease by k. A value of zero means no opening or closing parentheses, and no change in the number of common ancestors.
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Thus, different parenthesized strings β1β2 . . .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"β|w| generate different label sequences, which proves injectivity ignoring nonterminals (note that δ(β|w|) does not affect injectivity as it is uniquely determined by the other values: it corresponds to closing all the parentheses that remain unclosed at that point).
",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
It remains to show that injectivity still holds when nonterminals are taken into account.,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Since we have already proven that trees with different structure produce different values of ni in the labels, it suffices to show that trees with the same structure, but different nonterminals, produce different values of ci.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Essentially, this reduces to showing that every nonterminal in the tree is mapped into a concrete ci.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"That said, consider a tree τ ∈ T|w|, and some nonterminal X in τ .",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Since trees in Tw do not have unary branches, X has at least two children.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Consider the rightmost word in the first child subtree, and call it wi.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Then, wi+1 is the leftmost word in the second child subtree, and X is the lowest common ancestor of wi and wi+1.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"Thus, ci = X , and a tree with identical structure but a different nonterminal at that position will generate a label sequence with a different value of ci.",2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
This concludes the proof of injectivity.,2.2 Theoretical correctness,[0],[0]
"We have shown that our proposed encoding is a total, injective function from trees without unary branches with yield of length |w| to sequences of |w| − 1 labels.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
This will serve as the basis for our reduction of constituent parsing to sequence labeling.,2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"However, to go from theory to practice, we
need to overcome two limitations of the theoretical encoding: non-surjectivity and the inability to encode unary branches.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"Fortunately, both can be overcome with simple techniques.
",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"Handling of unary branches The encoding function Φ|w| cannot directly assign the nonterminal symbols of unary branches, as there is not any pair of words (wi, wi+1) that have those in common.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"Figure 3 illustrates it with an example.
",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"It is worth remarking that this is not a limitation of our encoding, but of any encoding that would facilitate constituent parsing as sequence labeling, as the number of nonterminal nodes in a tree with unary branches is not bounded by any function of |w|.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"The fact that our encoding works for trees without unary branches owes to the fact that such a tree cannot have more than |w|−1 non-leaf nodes, and therefore it is always possible to encode all of them in labels associated with |w| − 1 leaf nodes.
",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"To overcome this issue, we follow a collapsing approach, as is common in parsers that need special treatment of unary chains (Finkel et al., 2008; Narayan and Cohen, 2016; Shen et al., 2018).",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"For clarity, we use the name intermediate unary chains
to refer to unary chains that end up into a nonterminal symbol (e.g. X → Y in Figure 3) and leaf unary chains to name those that yield a PoS tag (e.g. Z → T5).",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"Intermediate unary chains are collapsed into a chained single symbol, which can be encoded by Φ|w| as any other nonterminal symbol.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, leaf unary chains are collapsed together with the PoS tag, but these cannot be encoded and decoded by relying on Φ|w|, as our encoding assumes a fixed sequence of leaf nodes and does not encode them explicitly.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"To overcome this, we propose two methods:
1.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
To use an extra function to enrich the PoS tags before applying our main sequence labeling function.,2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"This function is of the form Ψ|w| : V
|w| → U |w|, where U is the set of labels of the leaf unary chains (without including the PoS tags) plus a dummy label ∅. Ψ|w| maps wi to ∅ if there is no leaf unary chain at wi, or to the collapsed label otherwise.
2.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"To extend our encoding function to predict them as a part of our labels li, by transforming them into 3-tuples (ni, ci, ui) where ui encodes the leaf unary chain collapsed label for wi, if there is any, or none otherwise.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"We call this extended encoding function Φ ′|w|.
",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
The former requires to run two passes of sequence labeling to deal with leaf unary chains.,2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"The latter avoids this, but the number of labels is larger and sparser.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"In §4 we discuss how these two approaches behave in terms of accuracy and speed.
",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
Non,2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
-surjectivity,2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"Our encoding, as defined formally in Section 2.1, is injective but not surjective, i.e., not every sequence of |w| − 1 labels of the form (ni, ci) corresponds to a tree in T|w|.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"In particular, there are two situations where a label sequence formally has no tree, and thus Φ−1|w| is not formally defined and we have to use extra heuristics or processing to define it:
• Sequences with conflicting nonterminals.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
A nonterminal can be the lowest common ancestor of more than two pairs of contiguous words when branches are non-binary.,2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"For example, in the tree in Figure 1, the lowest common ancestor of both “the” and “red” and of “red” and “toy” is the same NP node.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"This translates into c4 = NP , c5 = NP in the label sequence.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"If we take that sequence and set c5 = VP , we obtain a label sequence that
does not strictly correspond to the encoding of any tree, as it contains a contradiction: two elements referencing the same node indicate different nonterminal labels.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"In practice, this problem is trivial to solve: when a label sequence encodes several conflicting nonterminals at a given position in the tree, we compute Φ−1|w| using the first such nonterminal and ignoring the rest.
",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
• Sequences that produce unary structures.,2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"There are sequences of values ni that do not correspond to a tree in T|w| because the only tree structure satisfying the common ancestor conditions of their values (the one built by generating the string of βis in the injectivity proof) contains unary branchings, causing the problem described above where we do not have a specification for every nonterminal.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"An example of this is the sequence (1, S), (3, Y ), (1, S), (1, S) in absolute scaling, that was introduced in Figure 3.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"In practice, as unary chains have been previously collapsed, any generated unary node is considered as not valid and removed.",2.3 Limitations,[0],[0]
"Sequence labeling is an structured prediction task that generates an output label for every token in an input sequence (Rei and Søgaard, 2018).",3 Sequence Labeling,[0],[0]

"For example, suppose the elements of the ground set include animal names: “goldfish” and “carp” have a similar meaning, as do “crow” and “raven”.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"There are several applications in machine learning and data science that fit naturally into this setting, two of which we outline here.
",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"Constructing ensembles of machine learning models: Let V index a set of features, with subsets of V corresponding to subsets of features on which a model will be trained.",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
The classical feature selection problem would be to choose a single set of features that result in a good model.,1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"We’re interested instead in the problem of finding an ensemble of models, each trained on a different subset of features, that together achieve good performance (Canini et al., 2016).
",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"This can be done by grouping V into Aπ1 , A π 2 , . . .",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
", A π m, from which we form an ensemble of m models, the results of which are aggregated together e.g. by averaging, voting, or taking the minimum.",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"Given a submodular function f : V → R+ measuring the “quality” of a single feature subset, one natural goal would be to choose each Aπi to be individually high-quality, according to f .",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"However, since the ensemble outputs are being aggregated, it would be purposeless to have redundant models—many results (e.g. Kittler et al., 1998) suggest that when aggregating models, it is best for them to be as diverse as possible (so that the errors they make are independent, thereby improving accuracy and reducing variance).",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
This motivates us to seek blocks that are as different from each other as possible.,1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
Individual model quality combined with diversity is exactly what maximizing Eq.,1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
(2) encourages.,1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"Our case study (Section 6) was performed in this setting and supports the benefits of aggregating diverse models.
",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
Multiple mutually diverse summaries: Data summarization involves finding a small but representative subset of a large set.,1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"There are some cases where it is useful to have multiple mutually diverse summaries, each of which is representative of the whole.",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"For example, in parallel machine learning, where training data might need to be partitioned onto multiple machines distributed across a network, it can be useful to ensure that each subset is representative (so that local computations are accurate) but also diverse (since if two subsets are redundant, than so will the work that each processor performs).",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"As another example, consider the problem of document summarization.",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
"It can be useful to produce multiple representative but distinct summaries of a collection of documents, as this ensures all concepts are covered but different perspectives are preserved.",1.2. Applications,[0],[0]
Special cases of our problem have previously been studied.,2. Previous Work,[0],[0]
"For example, maximizing Eq.",2. Previous Work,[0],[0]
(1) with 1 = λ1 = 1 − λ2 over the space of all otherwise unconstrained partitions corresponds to the submodular fair allocation (SFA) problem.,2. Previous Work,[0],[0]

"A binary search algorithm (Khot & Ponnuswami, 2007) has a better factor of 1/(2m − 1) that is independent of n. A less practical approach uses an ellipsoid approximation (Goemans et al., 2009) of each submodular function and reduces SFA to its modular version yielding an approximation factor of 1/( √ nm1/4 log n log3/2m).",2. Previous Work,[0],[0]
"(Wei et al., 2015) shows that
a greedy algorithm has a 1/m approximation when all fi’s are the same.",2. Previous Work,[0],[0]

"Maximizing Eq. (1) with 0 = λ1 = 1 − λ2 over the space of all partitions corresponds to the submodular welfare problem (SW), which can be reduced to submodular maximization on an expanded ground set under a partition matroid constraint (Vondrák, 2008) using a greedy algorithm, an approach having a 1/2 guarantee (Fisher et al., 1978).",2. Previous Work,[0],[0]
"The multi-linear extension of a submodular function can be used in a continuous greedy approach that solves SW with a (1− 1/e) tight approximation factor (Vondrák, 2008).",2. Previous Work,[0],[0]
"When λ1 > 0, λ2 > 0, (Wei et al., 2015) offers two approaches.",2. Previous Work,[0],[0]

"The novelty of our optimization problem is that: (i) we may form not only partitions but also (k,m)-coverings and packings; (ii) we utilize a set of m matroids to define the feasibility of the individual blocks in a grouping; and (iii) we explicitly incorporate cross-block interaction terms.",2. Previous Work,[0],[0]
"As with the strategy for the submodular welfare problem (Vondrák, 2008), our approach to maximizing Eq. (2) starts by defining an expanded ground set V× (Figure 1), consisting of m disjoint unions of the original ground set V , i.e., the product set, defined as:

RKG3: We tested the method presented in Niu et al. (2016) using the implementation in the R package KGode.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
"This method implements gradient matching, where the interpolant is modeled using functions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces.",4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
"This approach, for which ODE parameters are estimated and not inferred, was shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of ODE estimation problems.",4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
"We used values ranging from 10−4 to 1 for the parameter λ that the method optimizes using cross-validation.
",4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
Warp: In the R package KGode there is also an implementation of the warping approach presented in Niu et al. (2018).,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
This method extends gradient matching techniques by attempting to construct a warping of the input where smooth Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces-based interpolants can effectively model nonstationary observations.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
The warping attempts to transform the original signal via assumptions on periodicity and regularity conditions.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
We used the default parameters and initialized the optimization of the warping function from a period equal to the interval where observations are available.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
"Similarly to RKG3, ODE parameters are estimated and not inferred.

"We report results on the Approximate Gradient Matching (AGM) approach in Dondelinger et al. (2013), implemented in the recently released R package deGradInfer.",4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
AGM implements a population Markov chain Monte Carlo approach tempering from the prior to the approximate posterior of ODE parameters based on an interpolation with GPs.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
In the experiments we use 10 parallel chains and we run them for 104 iterations.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
"In the implementation of AGM, the variance of the noise on the observations is assumed known and it is fixed; we expect this to give a slight advantage to this method.

MCMC:,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
In the R package deGradInfer there is also an implementation of a population Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler where the ODE is solved explicitly.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
In this case too we use 10 parallel chains that we run for 104 iterations.,4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
"In contrast to AGM, in this implementation, the variance of the noise on the observations is learned together with ODE parameters.",4.2.1. BENCHMARK,[0],[0]
Figure 4.2.2 shows the distribution of the root mean squared error (RMSE) across folds for each experimental setting (see supplement for details).,4.2.2. RESULTS,[0],[0]
"We note that the proposed method consistently leads to better RMSE values compared to the reference approaches (except some folds in one of the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo experiments, according to a Mann-
Whitney nonparametric test), and that DGP-t provides more consistent parameter estimates than DGP-G. This latter result may indicate a lower sensitivity to outliers derivatives involved in the functional constraint term.",4.2.2. RESULTS,[0],[0]
This is a crucial aspect due to the generally noisy derivative terms of nonparametric regression models.,4.2.2. RESULTS,[0],[0]
"The distribution of the parameters for all the datasets tested in this study, which we report in the supplementary material, reveals that, unlike the nonprobabilistic methods RKG3 and WARP, our approach is capable of inferring ODE parameters yielding meaningful uncertainty estimation.

"Moreover, the RMSE is lower on observed states compared to unobserved ones.",4.4. Scalability test - large s,[0],[0]
This is confirmed by visual inspection of the modeling results for sample training and testing states (Figure 4).,4.4. Scalability test - large s,[0],[0]
"The observed states are generally associated with lower uncertainty in the predictions and by an accurate fitting of the solutions (Figure 4, top).",4.4. Scalability test - large s,[0],[0]

We explore here the capability of a DGP to accommodate for the data nonstationarity typical of ODE systems.,4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]

"The data is modeled with DGPs composed by one (“shallow” GP), two and three layers, all with RBF covariances.

Figure 5 shows the modeling results obtained on the two configurations.,4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]
We note that the shallow GP consistently underfits the complex dynamics producing smooth interpolants.,4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]
"On the contrary, DGPs provide a better representation of the nonstationarity.",4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]

"Furthermore, in order to motivate the importance of nonstationarity, which we implement through DGPs, we further compared against shallow GPs with lower degrees of smoothness through the use of Matérn covariances with degrees ν = 1/2, 1, 3/2, 5/2.
",4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]
The overall performance in parameter estimation and data fit is reported in Table 1.,4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]
"According to the results, a two-layer DGP provides the best solution overall in terms of modeling accuracy and complexity.",4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, the Matérn covariance, with an appropriate degree of smoothness, achieves superior performance in parameter estimation in case of low sample size.",4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]
"However, the nonstationarity implemented by the DGP outperforms the stationary Matérn in the data fit, as well as in the parameter estimation when the sample size is large.",4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]
For an illustration of the data fit of the Matérn GP we refer the reader to the supplementary material.,4.4.1. DEEP VS SHALLOW,[0],[0]

In the monotonic case the GP derivatives lie on the positive part of the plane.,4.5. Inequality constraints,[0],[0]

The introduction of the CNN-DailyMail corpus by Hermann et al. (2015) allowed for the application of large-scale training of deep learning models for summarization.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]

"While most work on these summarization tasks often exploit domain-specific features (e.g. speaker identification in meeting summarization (Galley, 2006; Gillick et al., 2009)), we purposefully avoid such features in this work in order to understand the extent to which deep learning models can perform content selection using only surface lexical features.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]

differences are quite small (.18 on CNN/DM, .41 on NYT, .3 on DUC) suggesting that the model’s predictions are not overly dependent on any particular word types.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]

"Document Shuffling Sentence position is a well known and powerful feature for news summarization (Hong and Nenkova, 2014), owing to the intentional lead bias in the news article writing10; it also explains the difficulty in beating the lead baseline for single-document summarization (Nenkova, 2005; Brandow et al., 1999).",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"In examining the generated summaries, we found most of the selected sentences in the news domain came from the lead paragraph of the document.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"This is despite the fact that there is a long tail of sentence extractions from later in the document in the ground truth extract summaries (31%, 28.3%, and 11.4% of DUC, CNN/DM, and NYT training extract labels come from the second half of the document).",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"Because this lead bias is so strong, it is questionable whether the models are learning to identify important content or just find the start of the document.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
We conduct a sentence order experiment where each document’s sentences are randomly shuffled during training.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"We then evaluate each model performance on the unshuffled test data, comparing to the model trained on unshuffled data; if the models trained on shuffled data drop in performance, then this indicates the lead bias is the relevant factor.
",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
Table 5 shows the results of the shuffling experiments.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
The news domains and PubMed suffer a significant drop in performance when the document order is shuffled.,5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"By comparison, there is no significant difference between the shuffled and inorder models on the Reddit domain, and shuffling actually improves performance on AMI.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
"This suggest that position is being learned by the models in the news/journal article domain even when the
10https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)
model has no explicit position features, and that this feature is more important than either content or function words.",5.3 Results,[0],[0]
Learning content selection for summarization in the news domain is severely inhibited by the lead bias.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
The summaries generated by all systems described here–the prior work and our proposed simplified models–are highly similar to each other and to the lead baseline.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The Cheng & Lapata and Seq2Seq extractors (using the averaging encoder) share 87.8% of output sentences on average on the CNN/DM data, with similar numbers for the other news domains (see Table 6 for a typical example).",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Also on CNN/DM, 58% of the Seq2Seq selected sentences also occur in the lead summary, with similar numbers for DUC, NYT, and Reddit.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Shuffling reduces lead overlap to 35.2% but the overall system performance drops significantly; the models are not able to identify important information without position.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The relative robustness of the news domain to part of speech ablation also suggests that models are mostly learning to recognize the stylistic features unique to the beginning of the article, and not the content.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Additionally, the drop in performance when learning word embeddings on the news domain suggests that word embeddings alone do not provide very generalizable content features compared to recognizing the lead.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
The picture is rosier for non-news summarization where part of speech ablation leads to larger performance differences and shuffling either does not inhibit content selection significantly or leads to modest gains.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Learning better word-level representations on these domains will likely require much larger corpora, something which might remain unlikely for personal stories and meetings.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The lack of distinction among sentence encoders is interesting because it echoes findings in the generic sentence embedding literature where word embedding averaging is frustratingly difficult to outperform (Iyyer et al., 2015; Wieting et al., 2015; Arora et al., 2016; Wieting and Gimpel, 2017).",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The inability to learn useful sentence representations is also borne out in the SummaRunner model, where there are explicit similarity computations between document or summary representations and sentence embeddings; these computations do not seem to add much to the per-
formance as the Cheng & Lapata and Seq2Seq models which lack these features generally perform as well or better.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, the Cheng & Lapata and SummaRunner extractors both construct a history of previous selection decisions to inform future choices but this does not seem to significantly improve performance over the Seq2Seq extractor (which does not).",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This suggests that we need to rethink or find novel forms of sentence representation for the summarization task.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"A manual examination of the outputs revealed some interesting failure modes, although in general it was hard to discern clear patterns of behaviour other than lead bias.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"On the news domain, the models consistently learned to ignore quoted material in the lead, as often the quotes provide color to the story but are unlikely to be included in the summary (e.g. “It was like somebody slugging a punching bag.”).",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This behavior was most likely triggered by the presence of quotes, as the quote attributions, which were often tokenized as separate sentences, would subsequently be included in the summary despite also not containing much information (e.g. Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday).",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
We have presented an empirical study of deep learning based content selection algorithms for summarization.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Our findings suggest such models face stark limitations on their ability to learn robust features for this task and that more work is needed on sentence representation for summarization.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"Neural machine translation (NMT) (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) has made significant progress in the past several years.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Its goal is to construct and utilize a single large neural network to accomplish the entire translation task.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One great advantage of NMT is that the translation system can be completely constructed by learning from data without human involvement (cf., feature engineering in statistical machine translation (SMT)).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The encoderdecoder architecture is widely employed (Cho et al.,
2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), in which the encoder summarizes the source sentence into a vector representation, and the decoder generates the target sentence word-by-word from the vector representation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The representation of the source sentence and the representation of the partially generated target sentence (translation) at each position are referred to as source context and target context, respectively.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The generation of a target word is determined jointly by the source context and target context.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Several techniques in NMT have proven to be very effective, including gating (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014) and attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) which can model long-distance dependencies and complicated align-

"Using an encoder-decoder framework that incorporates gating and attention techniques, it has been reported that the performance of NMT can surpass the performance of traditional SMT as measured by BLEU score (Luong et al., 2015).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite this success, we observe that NMT usually yields fluent but inadequate",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"translations.1 We attribute this to a stronger influence of target context on generation, which results from a stronger language model than that used in SMT.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One question naturally arises: what will happen if we change the ratio of influences from the source or target contexts?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Table 1 shows an example in which an attentionbased NMT system (Bahdanau et al., 2015) generates a fluent yet inadequate translation (e.g., missing the translation of “guǎngdōng”).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"When we halve the contribution from the source context, the result further loses its adequacy by missing the partial translation “in the first two months of this year”.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
One possible explanation is that the target context takes a higher weight and thus the system favors a shorter translation.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, when we halve the contribution from the target context, the result completely loses its fluency by repeatedly generating the translation of “chūkǒu” (i.e., “the export of”) until the generated translation reaches the maximum length.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, this example indicates that source and target contexts in NMT are highly correlated to translation adequacy and fluency, respectively.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In fact, conventional NMT lacks effective control on the influence of source and target contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"At each decoding step, NMT treats the source and target contexts equally, and thus ignores the different needs of the contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, content words in the target sentence are more related to the translation adequacy, and thus should depend more on the source context.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, function words in the target sentence are often more related to the translation fluency (e.g., “of” after “is fond”), and thus should depend more on the target context.

Context gates are non-linear gating units which can dynamically select the amount of context information in the decoding process.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, at each decoding step, the context gate examines both the source and target contexts, and outputs a ratio between zero and one to determine the percentages of information to utilize from the two contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this way, the system can balance the adequacy and fluency of the translation with regard to the generation of a word at each position.

An interesting finding is that we can replace the GRU units in the decoder with conventional RNN units and in the meantime utilize context gates.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The translation performance is comparable with the standard NMT system with GRU, but the system enjoys a simpler structure (i.e., uses only a single gate and half of the parameters) and a faster decoding (i.e., requires only half the matrix computations for decoding).2",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"In this work, the dimensionality of the decoding state is n = 1000, the dimensionality of the word embedding is m = 620, and the dimensionality of context representation is n′ = 2000.",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"The context gates only introduce 3.6M additional parameters, which is quite small compared to the number of parameters in the existing models (e.g., 84.3M in the “GroundHog (GRU )”).

Over GroundHog (vanilla),5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"We first carried out experiments on a simple decoder without gating function (Rows 2 and 3), to better estimate the impact of context gates.",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"As shown in Table 2, the proposed context gate significantly improved translation performance by 4.2 BLEU points on average.",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"It is worth emphasizing that context gate even outperforms a more sophisticated gating function (i.e., GRU in Row 4).",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"This is very encouraging, since our model only has a single gate with half of the parameters (i.e., 3.6M versus 7.2M) and less computations (i.e., half the matrix computations to update the decoding state8).
",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
8We only need to calculate the context gate once via Equation 4 and then apply it when updating the decoding state.,5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"In contrast, GRU requires the calculation of an update gate, a reset gate, a proposed updated decoding state and an interpolation between the previous state and the proposed state.",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"Please refer to (Cho et al., 2014) for more details.
",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
Over GroundHog (GRU) We then investigated the effect of the context gates on a standard NMT with GRU as the decoding activation function (Rows 4-7).,5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
Several observations can be made.,5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"First, context gates also boost performance beyond the GRU in all cases, demonstrating our claim that context gates are complementary to the reset and update gates in GRU.",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"Second, jointly controlling the information from both translation contexts consistently outperforms its single-side counterparts, indicating that a direct interaction between input signals from the source and target contexts is useful for NMT models.
",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"Over GroundHog-Coverage (GRU) We finally tested on a stronger baseline, which employs a coverage mechanism to indicate whether or not a source word has already been translated (Tu et al., 2016).",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"Our context gate still achieves a significant improvement of 1.6 BLEU points on average, reconfirming our claim that the context gate is complementary to the improved attention model that produces a better source context representation.",5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
"Finally, our best model (Row 7) outperforms the SMT baseline system using the same data (Row 1) by 3.3 BLEU points.

Subjective Evaluation We also conducted a subjective evaluation of the benefit of incorporating context gates.,5.2 Translation Quality,[0],[0]
Two human evaluators were asked to compare the translations of 200 source sentences randomly sampled from the test sets without knowing which system produced each translation.,5.2 Translation Quality,[1.0],['Two human evaluators were asked to compare the translations of 200 source sentences randomly sampled from the test sets without knowing which system produced each translation.']
Table 3 shows the results of subjective evaluation.,5.2 Translation Quality,[1.0],['Table 3 shows the results of subjective evaluation.']
"The two human evaluators made similar judgments: in adequacy, around 30% of GroundHog translations are worse, 52% are equal, and 18% are better; while in
fluency, around 29% are worse, 52% are equal, and 19% are better.",5.2 Translation Quality,[1.0000000332303778],"['The two human evaluators made similar judgments: in adequacy, around 30% of GroundHog translations are worse, 52% are equal, and 18% are better; while in fluency, around 29% are worse, 52% are equal, and 19% are better.']"
Table 4 lists the alignment performances.,5.3 Alignment Quality,[0],[0]
"Following Tu et al. (2016), we used the alignment error rate (AER) (Och and Ney, 2003) and its variant SAER to measure the alignment quality:
SAER = 1− |MA ×MS |+ |MA ×MP",5.3 Alignment Quality,[0],[0]
"| |MA|+ |MS |
where A is a candidate alignment, and S and P are the sets of sure and possible links in the reference alignment respectively (S ⊆ P ).",5.3 Alignment Quality,[0],[0]
"M denotes the alignment matrix, and for both MS and MP we assign the elements that correspond to the existing links in S and P probability 1 and the other elements probability 0.",5.3 Alignment Quality,[0],[0]
"In this way, we are able to better evaluate the quality of the soft alignments produced by attention-based NMT.
",5.3 Alignment Quality,[0],[0]
We find that context gates do not improve alignment quality when used alone.,5.3 Alignment Quality,[0],[0]
"When combined with coverage mechanism, however, it produces better alignments, especially one-to-one alignments by selecting the source word with the highest alignment probability per target word (i.e., AER score).",5.3 Alignment Quality,[0],[0]
"One possible reason is that better estimated decoding states (from the context gate) and coverage information help to produce more concentrated alignments, as shown in Figure 6.",5.3 Alignment Quality,[1.0],"['One possible reason is that better estimated decoding states (from the context gate) and coverage information help to produce more concentrated alignments, as shown in Figure 6.']"

"Several observations can be made:
• Operation Granularity (Rows 2 and 3): Element-wise multiplication (i.e., Context Gate (source)) outperforms the vector-level scalar (i.e., Gating Scalar), indicating that precise control of each element in the context vector boosts translation performance.
",5.4 Architecture Analysis,[0],[0]
"• Gate Strategy (Rows 3 and 4): When only fed with the previous decoding state ti−1, Context Gate (both) consistently outperforms Context Gate (source), showing that jointly controlling information from both source and target sides
is important for judging the importance of the contexts.

"• Peephole connections (Rows 4 and 5): Peepholes, by which the source context si controls the gate, play an important role in the context gate, which improves the performance by 0.57 in BLEU score.
