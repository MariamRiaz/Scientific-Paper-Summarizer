"Decades of research have been dedicated to heuristics for speeding up inference in natural language processing tasks, such as constituency parsing (Pauls and Klein, 2009; Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and machine translation (Petrov et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such research is necessary because of a trend toward richer models, which improve accuracy at the cost of slower inference.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, state-of-theart constituency parsers use grammars with millions of rules, while dependency parsers routinely use millions of features.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Without heuristics, these parsers take minutes to process a single sentence.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To speed up inference, we will learn a pruning policy.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"During inference, the pruning policy is invoked to decide whether to keep or prune various parts of the search space, based on features of the input and (potentially) the state of the inference process.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our approach searches for a policy with maximum end-to-end performance (reward) on training data, where the reward is a linear combination of problemspecific measures of accuracy and runtime, namely reward = accuracy−λ · runtime.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The parameter λ ≥ 0
specifies the relative importance of runtime and accuracy.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"By adjusting λ, we obtain policies with different speed-accuracy tradeoffs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For learning, we use Locally Optimal Learning to Search (LOLS) (Chang et al., 2015b), an algorithm for learning sequential decision-making policies, which accounts for the end-to-end performance of the entire decision sequence jointly.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, executing LOLS naively in our setting is prohibitive because it would run inference from scratch millions of times under different policies, training examples, and variations of the decision sequence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, this paper presents efficient algorithms for repeated inference, which are applicable to a wide variety of NLP tasks, including parsing, machine translation and sequence tagging.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These algorithms, based on change propagation and dynamic programming, dramatically reduce time spent evaluating similar decision sequences by leveraging problem structure and sharing work among evaluations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We evaluate our approach by learning pruning heuristics for constituency parsing.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this setting, our approach is the first to account for end-to-end performance of the pruning policy, without making independence assumptions about the reward function, as in prior work (Bodenstab et al., 2011).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the larger context of learning-to-search for structured prediction, our work is unusual in that it learns to control a dynamic programming algorithm (i.e., graphbased parsing) rather than a greedy algorithm (e.g., transition-based parsing).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our experiments show that accounting for end-to-end performance in training leads to better policies along the entire Pareto frontier of accuracy and runtime.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

Alg. 1 provides pseudocode for weighted CKY with pruning.,2 Weighted CKY with pruning,[0],[0]
"Weighted CKY aims to find the highestscoring derivation (parse tree) of a given sentence, where a given grammar specifies a non-negative score for each derivation rule and a derivation’s score is the product of the scores of the rules it uses.1 CKY uses a dynamic programming strategy to fill in a three-dimensional array β, known as the chart.",2 Weighted CKY with pruning,[0.9504897558631096],"['The goal of the tree is to maximize the recall of the candidate set so we call this approach “The Recall Tree.” In a traditional tree-based classifier, a traversal of the tree leads to a leaf, and a leaf corresponds to a single label, In the Recall Tree, we loosen the latter requirement and allow a leaf to corresponds to a set of labels of size O(logK).']"

"Additionally, we track a witness (backpointer) for each βikx, so that we can easily reconstruct the corresponding subderivation at line 23.",2 Weighted CKY with pruning,[0],[0]
"The chart is initialized with lexical grammar rules (lines 3–9), which derive words from grammar symbols.
",2 Weighted CKY with pruning,[0],[0]
"The key difference between pruned and unpruned CKY is an additional “if” statement (line 14), which queries the pruning policy π to decide whether to compute the several values βikx associated with a span (i, k).",2 Weighted CKY with pruning,[0],[0]
Note that width-1 and width-n spans are always kept because all valid parses require them.,2 Weighted CKY with pruning,[0],[0]
Bodenstab et al. (2011) train their pruning policy as a supervised classifier of spans.,3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"They derive direct supervision as follows: try to keep a span if it appears in the gold-standard parse, and prune it otherwise.",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]

End-to-end training gives us a principled way to decide what to prune.,3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"Rather than artificially labeling each pruning decision as inherently good or bad, we evaluate its effect in the context of the particular sentence and the other pruning decisions.",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"Actions that prune a gold constituent are not equally bad—some cause cascading errors, while others are “worked around” in the sense that the grammar still selects a mostly-gold parse.",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"Similarly, actions that prune a non-gold constituent are not equally good—some provide more overall speedup (e.g., pruning narrow constituents prevents wider ones from being built), and some even improve accuracy by suppressing an incorrect but high-scoring parse.
",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"More generally, the gold vs. non-gold distinction is not even available in NLP tasks where one is pruning potential elements of a latent structure, such as an alignment (Xu et al., 2013) or a finer-grained parse (Matsuzaki et al., 2005).",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"Yet our approach can still be used in such settings, by evaluating the reward on the downstream task that the latent structure serves.
",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
Past work on optimizing end-to-end performance is discussed in §8.,3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"One might try to scale these techniques to learning to prune, but in this work we take a different approach.",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"Given a policy, we can easily find small ways to improve it on specific sentences by varying individual pruning actions (e.g., if π currently prunes a span then try keeping it instead).",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"Given a batch of improved action sequences (trajectories), the remaining step is to search for a policy which produces the improved trajectories.",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"Conveniently, this can be reduced to a classification problem, much like the asymmetric weighting approach, except that the supervised labels and misclassification costs are not fixed across iterations, but rather are derived from interaction with the environment (i.e., PARSE and the reward function).",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"This idea is formalized as a learning algorithm called Locally Optimal Learning to Search (Chang et al., 2015b), described in §4.
",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
The counterfactual interventions we require— evaluating how reward would change if we changed one action—can be computed more efficiently using our novel algorithms (§5) than by the default strategy of running the parser repeatedly from scratch.,3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
"The key is to reuse work among evaluations, which is
possible because LOLS only makes tiny changes.",3 End-to-end training,[0],[0]
Pruned inference is a sequential decision process.,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
The process begins in an initial state s0.,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"In pruned CKY, s0 specifies the state of Alg.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]

"Next, the policy is invoked to choose action a0 = π(s0)—in",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
our case at line 14—which affects what the parser does next.,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"Eventually the parser reaches some state s1 from which it calls the policy to choose action a1 = π(s1), and so on.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"When the policy is invoked at state st, it selects action at based on features extracted from the current state st—a snapshot of the input sentence, grammar and parse chart at time t.3",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"We call the state-action sequence s0 a0 s1 a1 · · · sT a trajectory, where T is the trajectory length.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"At the final state, the reward function is evaluated, r(sT ).
",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
The LOLS algorithm for learning a policy is given in Alg.,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"2,4 with a graphical illustration in Fig. 1.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"At a high level, LOLS alternates between evaluating and improving the current policy πi.
",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"The evaluation phase first samples a trajectory from πi, called a roll-in: s0 a0 s1 a1 · · · sT ∼ ROLL-IN(πi).",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"In our setting, s0 is derived from a randomly sampled training sentence, but the rest of the trajectory is then deterministically computed by πi given s0.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"Then we revisit each state s in the roll-in (line 7), and try each available action ā∈A(s)",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"(line 9), executing πi thereafter—a rollout—to measure the resulting reward r̂[ā] (line 10).",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"Our parser is deterministic, so a single rollout is an unbiased, 0-variance estimate of the expected reward.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"This process is repeated many times, yielding a large list Q̂i of pairs 〈s, r̂〉, where s is a state that was encountered in some roll-in and r̂ maps the possible actions A(s) in that state to their measured rewards.

"The improvement phase now trains a new policy πi+1 to try to choose high-reward actions, seeking a policy that will “on average” get high rewards r[πi+1(s)].",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]

"LOLS concocts a training set and repeatedly revises it, similar to the well-known Expectation-Maximization algorithm.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
This enables end-to-end training of systems with discrete decisions and nondecomposable reward functions.,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
LOLS gives us a principled framework for deriving (nonstationary) “supervision” even in tricky cases such as latent-variable inference (mentioned in §3).,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"LOLS has strong theoretical guarantees, though in pathological cases, it may take exponential time to converge (Chang et al., 2015b).
",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"The inner loop of the evaluation phase performs roll-ins, interventions and rollouts.",4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
Roll-ins ensure that the policy is (eventually) trained under the distribution of states it tends to encounter at test time.,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
Interventions and rollouts force πi to explore the effect of currently disfavored actions.,4 Learning algorithm,[0],[0]
"Unlike most applications of LOLS and related algorithms, such as SEARN (Daumé III, 2006) and DAGGER (Ross et al., 2011), executing the policy is a major bottleneck in training.",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"Because our dynamic programming parser explores many possibilities (unlike a greedy, transition-based decoder) its trajectories are quite long.",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"This not only slows down each rollout: it means we must do more rollouts.

− 1− n,5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"for a sentence of length n, where T is also the number of pruning decisions: one for each span other than the root and width-1 spans.",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
LOLS must then perform T rollouts on this example.,5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"This means that to evaluate policy πi, we must parse each sentence in the minibatch hundreds of times (e.g., 189 for n=20, 434 for n=30, and 779 for n=40).
",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"We can regard each policy π as defining a pruning
mask m, an array that maps each of the T spans (i, k) to a decision mik (1 = keep, 0 = prune).",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"Each rollout tries flipping a different bit in this mask.
",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
We could spend less time on each sentence by sampling only some of its T rollouts (see §6).,5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"Regardless, the rollouts we do on a given sentence are related: in this section we show how to get further speedups by sharing work among them.",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"In §5.2, we leverage the fact that rollouts will be similar to one another (differing by a single pruning decision).",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
"In §5.3, we show that the reward of all T rollouts can be computed simultaneously by dynamic programming under some assumptions about the structure of the reward function (described later).",5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]
We found these algorithms to be crucial to training in a “reasonable” amount of time (see the empirical comparison in §7.2).,5 Efficient rollouts,[0],[0]

Reward functions and surrogates: Each user has a personal reward function.,7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we choose to specify our true reward as accuracy − λ · runtime, where accuracy is given by labeled F1 percentage and runtime by mega-pushes (mpush), millions of calls per sentence to lines 6 and 19 of Alg. 1, which is in practice proportional to seconds per sentence (correlation > 0.95) and is more replicable.",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
We evaluate accordingly (on test data)—but during LOLS training we approximate these metrics.,7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"We compare:
• rCP (fast): Use change propagation (§5.2) to compute accuracy on a sentence as F1 of just that sentence, and to approximate runtime as ||β||0,
the number of constituents that were built.10
• rDP (faster): Use dynamic programming (§5.3) to approximate accuracy on a sentence as expected recall.11 This time we approximate runtime more crudely as ||m||0, the number of nonzeros in the pruning mask for the sentence (i.e., the number of spans whose constituents the policy would be willing to keep if they were built).

We use these surrogates because they admit efficient rollout algorithms.,7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]

"The improvements hold up, as shown in Fig. 3.
",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"The rationale behind this design is that a user who actually wishes to maximize accuracy−λ·runtime, for some specific λ, could reasonably start by choosing the best baseline policy for this reward function, and then try to improve that baseline by running LOLS with the same reward function.",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"Our experiments show this procedure works for a range of λ values.
",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"In the real world, a user’s true objective might instead be some nonlinear function of runtime and accuracy.",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"For example, when accuracy is “good enough,” it may be more important to improve runtime, and vice-versa.",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
LOLS could be used with such a nonlinear reward function as well.,7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"In fact, a user does not even have to quantify their global preferences by writing down such a function.",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"Rather, they could select manually among the baseline policies, choosing one with an attractive speed-accuracy tradeoff, and then specify λ to indicate a local direction of desired improvement (like the green arrows in Fig. 2), modifying this direction periodically as LOLS runs.",7 Experimental design and results,[0],[0]
"As previous work has shown, learning to prune gives us excellent parsers with less than < 2% overhead
accuracy → ymax asymptotically as runtime → ∞. It obtains an excellent fit by placing accuracy and runtime on the loglogit scale—that is, log(xi + c) and logit(yi/ymax) transforms are used to convert our bounded random variables xi and yi to unbounded ones—and then assuming they are linearly related.
for deciding what to prune (i.e., pruning feature extraction and span classification).",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Even the baseline pruner has access to features unavailable to the grammar, and so it learns to override the grammar, improving an unpruned coarse parser’s accuracy from 61.1 to as high as 70.1% F1 on test data (i.e., beneficial search error).",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]

"For comparison, the most accurate baseline drops −0.03% F1 with a 9.7x speedup.
",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
"With the fine grammar, we do not see much improvement over the baseline in the accuracy > 85 regions.",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
This is because the supervision specified by asymmetric weighting is similar to what LOLS surmises via rollouts.,7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, in lower-accuracy regions we see that LOLS can significantly improve reward over its baseline policy.",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This is because the baseline supervision does not teach which plausible
constituents are “safest” to prune, nor can it learn strategies such as “skip all long sentences.”",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
"We discuss why LOLS does not help as much in the high accuracy regions further in §7.3.

"In a few cases in Fig. 2, LOLS finds no policy that improves surrogate reward on dev data.",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
"In these cases, surrogate reward does improve slightly on training data (not shown), but early stopping just keeps the initial (baseline) policy since it is just as good on dev data.",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]

",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, the rDP LOLS policies find higheraccuracy policies than the corresponding rCP policies, despite a greater mismatch in surrogate accuracy definitions.",7.1 Discussion,[0],[0]

"The most pronounced qualitative difference due to LOLS training is substantially lower rates of parse failure in the mid- to high- λ-range on both grammars

Part of the contribution of this paper is faster algorithms for performing LOLS rollouts during training (§5).,7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"Compared to the naive strategy of running the parser from scratch T times, rCP achieves speedups of 4.9–6.6x on the coarse grammar and 1.9–2.4x on the fine grammar.",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"rDP is even faster, 10.4–11.9x on coarse and 10.5–13.8x on fine.",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"Most of the speedup comes from longer sentences, which take up most of the runtime for all methods.",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
Our new algorithms enable us to train on fairly long sentences (≤ 40).,7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"We note that our implementations of rCP and rDP are not as highly optimized as our test-time parser, so there may be room for improvement.
",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
Orthogonal to the cost per rollout is the number of training iterations.,7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"LOLS may take many steps to converge if trajectories are long (i.e., T is large)
because each iteration of LOLS training attempts to improve the current policy by a single action.",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"In our setting, T is quite large (discussed extensively in §5), but we are able to circumvent slow convergence by initializing the policy (via the baseline method).",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
This means that LOLS can focus on fine-tuning a policy which is already quite good.,7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"In fact, in 4 cases, LOLS did not improve from its initial policy.
",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
We find that when λ is large—the cases where we get meaningful improvements because the initial policy is far from locally optimal—LOLS steadily and smoothly improves the surrogate reward on both training and development data.,7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"Because these are fast parsers, LOLS was able to run on the order of 10 (fine grammar) or 100 (coarse grammar) epochs within our 6-day limit; usually it was still improving when we terminated it.",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"By contrast, for the slower and more accurate small-λ parsers (which completed fewer training epochs), LOLS still improves surrogate reward on training data, but without systematically improving on development data—often the reward on development fluctuates, and early stopping simply picks the best of this small set of “random” variants.",7.2 Training speed and convergence,[0],[0]
"In §3, we argued that LOLS gives a more appropriate training signal for pruning than the baseline method of consulting the gold parse, because it uses rollouts to measure the full effect of each pruning decision in the context of the other decisions made by the policy.
",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"To better understand the results of our previous experiments, we analyze how often a rollout does determine that the baseline supervision for a span is suboptimal, and how suboptimal it is in those cases.
",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
We specifically consider LOLS rollouts that evaluate the rCP surrogate (because rDP is a cruder approximation to true reward).,7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"These rollouts Q̂i tell us what actions LOLS is trying to improve in its current policy πi for a given λ, although there is no guarantee that the learner in §4 will succeed at classifying Q̂i correctly (due to limited features, regularization, and the effects of dataset aggregation).

"We are interested in analyzing the expected regret over all gold and
non-gold spans, which we break down as
E[regret] = p(diff) (4) · ( p(gold | diff) · E[regret | gold, diff] + p(¬ gold | diff) · E[regret | ¬ gold, diff] )
where expectations are taken over s ∼ ROLL-IN(π).",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]

"We thus evaluate the oracle baseline against two LOLS oracles: the one used at the start of LOLS training (derived from the initial policy π1 that was trained on baseline supervision), and the one obtained at the end (derived from the LOLS-trained policy π∗ selected by early stopping).",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"These comparisons are shown by solid and dashed lines respectively.

"In most of these cases, pruning a gold span improves speed but leaves accuracy unchanged—because that gold span was missed anyway by the highest-scoring parse.",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
Such cases become both more frequent and more beneficial as λ increases and we prune more heavily.,7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"In a minority of cases, however, pruning a gold span also improves accuracy (through beneficial search error).

Coarse vs. fine (left vs. right):,7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"The two grammars differ mainly for small λ, and this difference comes especially from the top row.",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"With a fine grammar and small λ, the baseline parses are more accurate, so LOLS has less room for improvement: fewer
gold spans go unused, and fewer non-gold spans are needed for recovery.
",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"Effect of λ: Aggressive pruning (large λ) reduces accuracy, so its effect on the top row is similar to that of using a coarse grammar.",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"Aggressive pruning also has an effect on the middle row: there is more benefit to be derived from pruning unused gold spans (surprisingly), and especially from keeping those non-gold spans that are helpful (presumably they enable recovery from more severe parse errors).",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"These effects are considerably sharper with rDP reward (not shown here), which more smoothly evaluates the entire weighted pruned parse forest rather than trying to coordinate actions to ensure a good single 1-best tree; the baseline oracle is excellent at choosing the action that gets the better forest when the forest is mostly present (small λ) but not when it is mostly pruned (large λ).

Effect on retraining the policy: The black lines in the bottom graphs show the overall regret (on training data) if we were to perfectly follow the baseline oracle rather than the LOLS oracle.,7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"In practice, retraining the policy to match the oracle will not match it perfectly in either case.",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
"Thus the baseline method has a further disadvantage: when it trains a policy, its training objective weights all gold or all non-gold examples equally, whereas LOLS invests greater effort in matching the oracle on those states where doing so would give greater downstream reward.",7.3 Understanding the LOLS training signal,[0],[0]
Our experiments have focused on using LOLS to improve a reasonable baseline.,8 Related work,[0],[0]
Fig. 5 shows that our resulting parser fits reasonably among state-of-the-art constituency parsers trained and tested on the Penn Treebank.,8 Related work,[0],[0]
These parsers include a variety of techniques that improve speed or accuracy.,8 Related work,[0],[0]
"Many are quite orthogonal to our work here—e.g., the SpMV method (which is necessary for Bodenstab’s parser to beat ours) is a set of cache-efficient optimizations (Dunlop, 2014) that could be added to our parser (just as it was added to Bodenstab’s), while Hall et al. (2014) and Fernández-González and Martins (2015) replace the grammar with faster scoring models that have more conditional independence.",8 Related work,[0],[0]

"We would be remiss not to note that current transition-based parsers—for constituency parsing (Zhu et al., 2013; Crabbé, 2015) as well as dependency parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014)—are both incredibly fast and surprisingly accurate.",8 Related work,[0],[0]

Class imbalance in the training set is a very common example.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In applications such as object detection in the context of autonomous driving, the vast majority of the training data is composed of standard vehicles but models also need to recognize rarely seen classes such as emergency vehicles or animals with very high accuracy.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This will sometime lead to biased training models that do not perform well in practice.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Another popular type of training set bias is label noise.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To train a reasonable supervised deep model, we ideally need a large dataset with high-quality labels, which require many passes of expensive human quality assurance (QA).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although coarse labels are cheap and of high availability, the presence of noise will hurt the model performance, e.g. Zhang et al. (2017) has shown that a standard CNN can fit any ratio of label flipping noise in the training set and eventually leads to poor generalization performance.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Training set biases and misspecification can sometimes be addressed with dataset resampling (Chawla et al., 2002), i.e. choosing the correct proportion of labels to train a network on, or more generally by assigning a weight to each example and minimizing a weighted training loss.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The example weights are typically calculated based on the training loss, as in many classical algorithms such as AdaBoost (Freund & Schapire, 1997), hard negative mining (Malisiewicz et al., 2011), self-paced learning (Kumar et al., 2010), and other more recent work (Chang et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, there exist two contradicting ideas in training loss based approaches.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In noisy label problems, we prefer examples with smaller training losses as they are more likely to be clean images; yet in class imbalance problems, algorithms such as hard negative mining (Malisiewicz et al., 2011) prioritize examples with higher training loss since they are more likely to be the minority class.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In cases when the training set is both imbalanced and noisy, these existing methods would have the wrong model assumptions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In fact, without a proper definition of an unbiased test set, solving the training set bias problem is inherently ill-defined.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As the model cannot distinguish the right from the wrong, stronger regularization can usually work surprisingly well in certain synthetic noise settings.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here we argue that in order to learn general forms of training set biases, it is necessary to have a small unbiased validation to guide training.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"It is actually
not uncommon to construct a dataset with two parts - one relatively small but very accurately labeled, and another massive but coarsely labeled.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Coarse labels can come from inexpensive crowdsourcing services or weakly supervised data (Cordts et al., 2016; Russakovsky et al., 2015; Chen & Gupta, 2015).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Different from existing training loss based approaches, we follow a meta-learning paradigm and model the most basic assumption instead: the best example weighting should minimize the loss of a set of unbiased clean validation examples that are consistent with the evaluation procedure.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Traditionally, validation is performed at the end of training, which can be prohibitively expensive if we treat the example weights as some hyperparameters to optimize; to circumvent this, we perform validation at every training iteration to dynamically determine the example weights of the current batch.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Towards this goal, we propose an online reweighting method that leverages an additional small validation set and adaptively assigns importance weights to examples in every iteration.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We experiment with both class imbalance and corrupted label problems and find that our approach significantly increases the robustness to training set biases.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The idea of weighting each training example has been well studied in the literature.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Importance sampling (Kahn & Marshall, 1953), a classical method in statistics, assigns weights to samples in order to match one distribution to another.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost (Freund & Schapire, 1997), select harder examples to train subsequent classifiers.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similarly, hard example mining (Malisiewicz et al., 2011), downsamples the majority class and exploits the most difficult examples.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) adds a soft weighting scheme that emphasizes harder examples.
",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
Hard examples are not always preferred in the presence of outliers and noise processes.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
Robust loss estimators typically downweigh examples with high loss.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In selfpaced learning (Kumar et al., 2010), example weights are obtained through optimizing the weighted training loss encouraging learning easier examples first.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In each step, the learning algorithm jointly solves a mixed integer program that iterates optimizing over model parameters and binary example weights.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Various regularization terms on the example weights have since been proposed to prevent overfitting and trivial solutions of assigning weights to be all zeros (Kumar et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2015).",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
Wang et al. (2017) proposed a Bayesian method that infers the example weights as latent variables.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"More recently, Jiang et al. (2017) proposed to use a meta-learning LSTM to output the weights of the examples based on the training loss.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Reweighting examples is also related to curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009), where the model reweights
among many available tasks.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similar to self-paced learning, typically it is beneficial to start with easier examples.
",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
One crucial advantage of reweighting examples is robustness against training set bias.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"There has also been a multitude of prior studies on class imbalance problems, including using dataset resampling (Chawla et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2017), cost-sensitive weighting (Ting, 2000; Khan et al., 2015), and structured margin based objectives (Huang et al., 2016).",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Meanwhile, the noisy label problem has been thoroughly studied by the learning theory community (Natarajan et al., 2013; Angluin & Laird, 1988) and practical methods have also been proposed (Reed et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar & Fergus, 2014; Xiao et al., 2015; Azadi et al., 2016; Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2017; Li et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Vahdat, 2017; Hendrycks et al., 2018).",2.

"Using validation loss as the meta-objective has been explored in recent meta-learning literature for few-shot learning (Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Ren et al., 2018; Lorraine & Duvenaud, 2018), where only a handful of examples are available for each class.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our algorithm also resembles MAML (Finn et al., 2017) by taking one gradient descent step on the meta-objective for each iteration.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]

Current practice in NLP is to treat each new sentence as a fresh discrete optimization problem and pay the computational price each time.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this practice is not only expensive, but also wasteful!",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We ignore the fact that slight changes to inputs often do not change the output, or even the sequence of steps taken to produce it.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, not all outputs are linguistically meaningful structures; as we make more predictions, we should be able to learn to prune the output space.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The motivating question that drives our work is: Can we design inference schemes that learn to make a trained structured predictor faster without sacrificing output quality?,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"After training, the structured classifier can be thought as a black-box.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Typically, once deployed, it is never modified over its lifetime of classifying new examples.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Subsequently, we can view each prediction of the black-box classifier as an opportunity to learn how to navigate the output space more efficiently.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, if the classifier sees a previously encountered situation, it could make some decisions without needless computations.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We formalize this intuition by considering the trained models as solving arbitrary integer linear programs (ILPs) for combinatorial inference.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We train a second, inexpensive speedup classifier which acts as a heuristic for a searchbased inference algorithm that mimics the more expensive black-box classifier.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The speedup heuristic is a function that learns regularities among predicted structures.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present a mistake bound algorithm that, over the classifier’s lifetime, learns to navigate the feasible regions of the ILPs.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"By doing so, we can achieve a reduction in inference time.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We further identify inference situations where the learned speedup heuristic alone can correctly label parts of the outputs without computing the corresponding input features.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In such situations, the search algorithm can safely ignore parts of inputs if the corresponding outputs can be decided based on the sub-structures constructed so far.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Seen this way, the speedup classifier can be seen as a statistical cache of past decisions made by the black-box classifier.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We instantiate our strategy to the task of predicting entities and relations from sentences.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Using an ILP based black-box classifier, we show that the trained speedup classifier mimics the reference inference algorithm to obtain improvements in running time, and also recovers its accuracy.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

The idea of learning memo functions to make computation more efficient goes back to Michie (1968).,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Speedup learning has been studied since the eighties in the context of general problem solving, where the goal is to learn a problem solver that becomes faster as opposed to becoming more accurate as it sees more data.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Fern (2011) gives a broad survey of this area.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we presented a variant of this idea that is more concretely applied to structured output prediction.
",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Efficient inference is a central topic in structured prediction.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In order to achieve efficiency, various strategies are adopted in the literature.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Search based strategies are commonly used for this purpose and several variants abound.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"The idea of framing a structured prediction problem as a search problem has been explored by several previous works (Collins & Roark, 2004; Daumé III & Marcu, 2005; Daumé III et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2012; Doppa et al., 2014).",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"It usually admits incorporating arbitrary features more easily than fully global structured prediction models like conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), structured perceptron (Collins, 2002), and structured support vector machines (Taskar et al., 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In such cases too, inference can be solved approximately using heuristic search.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Either a fixed beam size (Xu et al., 2009), or a dynamicallysized beam (Bodenstab et al., 2011) can be used.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
In our work we fix the beam size.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
The key difference from previous work is that our ranking function combines information from the trained model with the heuristic function which characterizes constraint information.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Closely related to the
work described in this paper are approaches that learn to prune the search space (He et al., 2014; Vieira & Eisner, 2016) and learn to select features (He et al., 2013).
",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Another line of recent related work focuses on discovering problem level regularities across the inference space.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"These amortized inference schemes are designed using deterministic rules for discovering when a new inference problem can re-use previously computed solutions (Srikumar et al., 2012; Kundu et al., 2013) or in the context of a Bayesian network by learning a stochastic inverse network that generates outputs (Stuhlmüller et al., 2013).
",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work is also related to the idea of imitation learning (Daumé III et al., 2009; Ross et al., 2011; Ross & Bagnell, 2014; Chang et al., 2015).",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this setting, we are given a reference policy, which may or may not be a good policy.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"The goal of learning is to learn another policy to imitate the given policy, or even learn a better one.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Learning usually proceeds in an online fashion.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, imitation learning requires learning a new policy which is independent of the given reference policy, since during test time the reference policy is no longer available.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In our case, we can think of the black-box solver as a reference policy.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"During prediction we always have this solver at our disposal, what we want is avoiding unnecessary calls to the solver.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Following recent successes in imitation learning, we expect that we can replace the linear heuristic function with a deep network to avoid feature design.
",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Also related is the idea of knowledge distillation (Bucilă et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015; Kim & Rush, 2016), that seeks to train a student classifier (usually a neural network) to compress and mimic a larger teacher network, thus improve prediction speed.",6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
The primary difference with the speedup idea of this paper is that our goal is to be more efficient at constructing internally self-consistent structures without explicitly searching over the combinatorially large output space with complex constraints.,6. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we asked whether we can learn to make inference faster over the lifetime of a structured output classifier.",7. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"To address this question, we developed a search-based strategy that learns to mimic a black-box inference engine but is substantially faster.",7. Conclusions,[0],[0]
We further extended this strategy by identifying cases where the learned search algorithm can avoid expensive input feature extraction to further improve speed without losing accuracy.,7. Conclusions,[0],[0]
We empirically evaluated our proposed algorithms on the problem of extracting entities and relations from text.,7. Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Despite using an object-heavy JVM-based implementation of search, we showed that by exploiting regularities across the output space, we can outperform the industrial strength Gurobi integer linear program solver in terms of speed, while matching its accuracy.

Predicting structured outputs can be computationally onerous due to the combinatorially large output spaces.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we focus on reducing the prediction time of a trained black-box structured classifier without losing accuracy.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"To do so, we train a speedup classifier that learns to mimic a black-box classifier under the learning-to-search approach.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"As the structured classifier predicts more examples, the speedup classifier will operate as a learned heuristic to guide search to favorable regions of the output space.",abstractText,[0],[0]
We present a mistake bound for the speedup classifier and identify inference situations where it can independently make correct judgments without input features.,abstractText,[0],[0]
We evaluate our method on the task of entity and relation extraction and show that the speedup classifier outperforms even greedy search in terms of speed without loss of accuracy.,abstractText,[0],[0]
Learning to Speed Up Structured Output Prediction,title,[0],[0]
"In conventional ODE modelling coefficients of an equation driving the system state forward in time are estimated. However, for many complex systems it is practically impossible to determine the equations or interactions governing the underlying dynamics. In these settings, parametric ODE model cannot be formulated. Here, we overcome this issue by introducing a novel paradigm of nonparametric ODE modelling that can learn the underlying dynamics of arbitrary continuous-time systems without prior knowledge. We propose to learn non-linear, unknown differential functions from state observations using Gaussian process vector fields within the exact ODE formalism. We demonstrate the model’s capabilities to infer dynamics from sparse data and to simulate the system forward into future.",text,[0],[0]

Learning word representations has become a fundamental problem in processing natural languages.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These semantic representations, which map a word into a point in a linear space, have been widely applied in downstream applications, including named entity recognition (Guo et al., 2014), document ranking (Nalisnick et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Irsoy and Cardie, 2014), question answering (Antol et al., 2015), and image captioning (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Over the past few years, various approaches have been proposed to learn word vectors (e.g., (Pennington et al., 2014; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Levy and Goldberg, 2014b; Ji et al., 2015)) based on co-occurrence information between words observed on the training corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The intuition behind this is to represent words with similar vectors if
they have similar contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To learn a good word embedding, most approaches assume a large collection of text is freely available, such that the estimation of word co-occurrences is accurate.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, the Google Word2Vec model (Mikolov et al., 2013a) is trained on the Google News dataset, which contains around 100 billion tokens, and the GloVe embedding (Pennington et al., 2014) is trained on a crawled corpus that contains 840 billion tokens in total.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, such an assumption may not hold for low-resource languages such as Inuit or Sindhi, which are not spoken by many people or have not been put into a digital format.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For those languages, usually, only a limited size corpus is available.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Training word vectors under such a setting is a challenging problem.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
One key restriction of the existing approaches is that they often mainly rely on the word pairs that are observed to co-occur on the training data.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"When the size of the text corpus is small, most word pairs are unobserved, resulting in an extremely sparse co-occurrence matrix (i.e., most entries are zero)1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, the text82 corpus has about 17,000,000 tokens and 71,000 distinct words.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The corresponding co-occurrence matrix has more than five billion entries, but only about 45,000,000 are non-zeros (observed on the training corpus).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most existing approaches, such as Glove and Skip-gram, cannot handle a vast number of zero terms in the co-occurrence matrix; therefore, they only sub-sample a small subset of zero entries during the training.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, we argue that the unobserved word pairs can provide valuable information for training a word embedding model, especially when the co-occurrence matrix is very sparse.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"The idea of learning word representations can be traced back to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) and Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) (Lund and Burgess, 1996), where word vectors are generated by factorizing a worddocument and word-word co-occurrence matrix, respectively.",2 Related work,[0],[0]

these approaches are often less flexible.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Besides, directly factorizing the co-occurrence matrix may cause the frequent words dominating the training objective.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In the past decade, various approaches have been proposed to improve the training of word embeddings.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"For example, instead of factorizing the co-occurrence count matrix, Bullinaria and Levy (2007); Levy and Goldberg (2014b) proposed to factorize point-wise mutual information (PMI) and positive PMI (PPMI) matrices as these metrics scale the co-occurrence counts (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Levy and Goldberg, 2014b).",2 Related work,[0],[0]

"Very recently, WordRank model (Ji et al., 2015) has been proposed to minimize a ranking loss which naturally fits the tasks requiring ranking based evaluation metrics.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Stratos et al. (2015) also proposed CCA (canonical correlation analysis)-based word embedding which shows competitive performance.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"All these approaches focus on the situations where a large text corpus is available.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning: Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning (Li and Liu, 2005) is proposed for training a model when the positive instances are partially labeled and the unlabeled instances are mostly negative.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Recently, PU learning has been used in many classification and collaborative filtering applications due to the nature of “implicit feedback” in many recommendation systems—users usually only provide positive feedback (e.g., purchases, clicks) and it is very hard to collect negative feedback.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"To resolve this problem, a series of PU matrix completion algorithms have been proposed (Pan et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2008; Pan and Scholz, 2009; Qin et al., 2010; Paquet and Koenigstein, 2013; Hsieh et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2017b).",2 Related work,[0],[0]

"Similar to GloVe and other word embedding learning algorithms, the proposed approach consists of three steps.",3 PU-Learning for Word Embedding,[0],[0]
The first step is to construct a cooccurrence matrix.,3 PU-Learning for Word Embedding,[0],[0]
"Follow the literature (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a), we use the PPMI metric to measure the co-occurrence between words.",3 PU-Learning for Word Embedding,[0],[0]
"Then, in the second step, a PU-Learning approach is applied to factorize the co-occurrence matrix and generate word vectors and context vectors.",3 PU-Learning for Word Embedding,[0],[0]
"Finally, a post-processing step generates the final embedding vector for each word by combining the word vector and the context vector.
",3 PU-Learning for Word Embedding,[0],[0]
We summarize the notations used in this paper in Table 1 and describe the details of each step in the remainder of this section.,3 PU-Learning for Word Embedding,[0],[0]
Various metrics can be used for estimating the co-occurrence between words in a corpus.,3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"PPMI metric stems from point-wise mutual information (PMI) which has been widely used as a measure of word association in NLP for various tasks (Church and Hanks, 1990).",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"In our case, each entry PMI(w, c) represents the relevant measure between a word w and a context word c by calculating the ratio between their joint probability (the
chance they appear together in a local context window) and their marginal probabilities (the chance they appear independently) (Levy and Goldberg, 2014b).",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"More specifically, each entry of PMI matrix can be defined by
PMI(w, c) = log P̂ (w, c)
P̂ (w) ·",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"P̂ (c) , (1)
where P̂ (w), P̂ (c) and P̂ (w, c) are the the frequency of word w, word c, and word pairs (w, c), respectively.",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"The PMI matrix can be computed based on the co-occurrence counts of word pairs, and it is an information-theoretic association measure which effectively eliminates the big differences in magnitude among entries in the cooccurrence matrix.
",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"Extending from the PMI metric, the PPMI metric replaces all the negative entries in PMI matrix by 0:
PPMI(w, c) = max(PMI(w, c), 0).",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"(2)
The intuition behind this is that people usually perceive positive associations between words (e.g. “ice” and “snow”).",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"In contrast, the negative association is hard to define (Levy and Goldberg, 2014b).",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"Therefore, it is reasonable to replace the negative entries in the PMI matrix by 0, such that the negative association is treated as “uninformative”.",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"Empirically, several existing works (Levy et al., 2015; Bullinaria and Levy, 2007) showed that the PPMI metric achieves good performance on various semantic similarity tasks.
",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"In practice, we follow the pipeline described in Levy et al. (2015) to build the PPMI matrix and apply several useful tricks to improve its quality.",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"First, we apply a context distribution smoothing mechanism to enlarge the probability of sampling a rare context.",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"In particular, all context counts are scaled to the power of α.4:
PPMIα(w, c) = max
( log P̂ (w, c)
P̂ (w)P̂α(c) , 0
)
P̂α(c) = #(c)α∑ c̄ #(c̄) α ,
where #(w) denotes the number of times word w appears.",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"This smoothing mechanism effectively

",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"alleviates PPMI’s bias towards rare words (Levy et al., 2015).
",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"Next, previous studies show that words that occur too frequent often dominate the training objective (Levy et al., 2015) and degrade the performance of word embedding.",3.1 Building the Co-Occurrence Matrix,[0],[0]
"To avoid this issue, we follow Levy et al. (2015) to sub-sample words with frequency more than a threshold twith a probability p defined as:

"Eq (3) is very similar to the one used in previous matrix factorization approaches such as GloVe, but we propose a new way to set the weights Cij .",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"If we set equal weights for all the entries, then Cij = constant, and the model is very similar to conducting SVD for the PPMI matrix.",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"Previous work has shown that this approach often suffers from poor performance (Pennington et al., 2014).",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"More advanced methods, such as GloVe, set non-uniform weights for observed entries to reflect their confidence.",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"However, the time complexity of their algorithm is proportional to number of nonzero weights (|(i, j) | Cij 6= 0|), thus they have to set zero weights for all the unobserved entries (Cij = 0 for Ω−), or try to incorporate a small set of unobserved entries by negative sampling.
",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"We propose to set the weights for Ω+ and Ω−
differently using the following scheme:
Cij =   (Qij/xmax)",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]

"Here xmax and α are re-weighting parameters, and ρ is the unified weight for unobserved terms.",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"We will discuss them later.
",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"For entries in Ω+, we set the non-uniform weights as in GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), which assigns larger weights to context word that appears more often with the given word, but also avoids overwhelming the other terms.",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"For entries in Ω−, instead of setting their weights to be 0, we assign a small constant weight ρ.",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"The main idea is from the literature of PU-learning (Hu et al., 2008; Hsieh et al., 2015): although missing entries are highly uncertain, they are still likely to be true 0, so we should incorporate them in the learning process but multiplying with a smaller weight according to the uncertainty.",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"Therefore, ρ in (5) reflects how confident we are to the zero entries.
",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, we set xmax = 10, α = 3/4 according to (Pennington et al., 2014), and let ρ be a parameter to tune.",3.2 PU-Learning for Matrix Factorization,[0],[0]

Note that the x-axis is in log scale.,5 Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"When ρ is fixed, a big λ degrades the performance of the model significantly.",5 Experimental Results,[0],[0]

Co-reference resolution requires models to cluster mentions that refer to the same physical entities.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The models based on neural networks typically require different levels of semantic representations of input sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The models usually need to calculate the representations of word spans, or mentions, given pre-trained character and wordlevel embeddings (Turian et al., 2010; Pennington et al., 2014) before predicting antecedents.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The mention-level embeddings are used to make coreference decisions, typically by scoring mention pairs and making links (Lee et al., 2017; Clark and Manning, 2016a; Wiseman et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Long short-term memories (LSTMs) are often used to encode the syntactic and semantic information of input sentences.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Articles and conversations include more than one sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Considering the accuracy and efficiency of co-reference resolution models, the encoder LSTM usually processes input sentences separately as a batch (Lee et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The disadvantage of this method is that the models do not consider the dependency among words from different sentences, which plays a significant role in word representation learning and co-reference predicting.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, pronouns are often linked to entities mentioned in other sentences, while their initial word vectors lack dependency information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, a word representation model cannot learn an informative embedding of a pronoun without considering cross-sentence dependency in this case.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It is also problematic if we encode the input document considering cross-sentence dependency and treat the entire document as one sentence.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
An input article or conversation can be too long for a single LSTM cell to memorize.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"If the LSTM updates itself for too many steps, gradients will vanish or explode (Pascanu et al., 2013), and the coreference resolution model will be very difficult to optimize.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Regarding the entire input corpus as one sequence instead of a batch also significantly increases the time complexity of the model.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To solve the problem that traditional LSTM encoders, which treat the input sentences as a batch, lack an ability to capture cross-sentence dependency, and to avoid the time complexity and difficulties of training the model concatenating all input sentences, we propose a cross-sentence encoder for end-to-end co-reference (E2E-CR).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Borrowing the idea of an external memory module from Sukhbaatar et al. (2015), an external memory block containing syntactic and semantic information from context sentences is added to the standard LSTM model.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"With this context memory block, the proposed model is able to encode
input sentences as a batch, and also calculate the representations of input words by taking both target sentences and context sentences into consideration.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Experiments showed that this approach improved the performance of co-reference resolution models.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A popular method of co-reference resolution is mention ranking (Durrett and Klein, 2013).",2.1 Co-reference Resolution,[0],[0]
"Reading each mention, the model calculates coreference scores for all antecedent mentions, and picks the mention with the highest positive score to be its co-reference.",2.1 Co-reference Resolution,[0],[0]

reason for this limitation is the fact that these supervised approaches require enormous amounts of very expensive human transcripts.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"Moreover, the use of the written word is a convenient but limiting convention, since there are many oral languages which do not even employ a writing system.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"In constrast, infants learn to communicate verbally before they are capable of reading and writing - so there is no inherent reason why spoken language systems need to be inseparably tied to text.
",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
The key contribution of this paper has two facets.,1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"First, we introduce a methodology capable of not only discovering word-like units from continuous speech at the waveform level with no additional text transcriptions or conventional speech recognition apparatus.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"Instead, we jointly learn the semantics of those units via visual associations.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"Although we evaluate our algorithm on an English corpus, it could conceivably run on any language without requiring any text or associated ASR capability.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"Second, from a computational perspective, our method of speech pattern discovery runs in linear time.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"Previous work has presented algorithms for performing acoustic pattern discovery in continuous speech (Park and Glass, 2008; Jansen et al., 2010; Jansen and Van Durme, 2011) without the use of transcriptions or another modality, but those algorithms are limited in their ability to scale by their inherent O(n2) complexity, since they do an exhaustive comparison of the data against itself.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
Our method leverages correlated information from a second modality - the visual domain - to guide the discovery of words and phrases.,1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"This enables our method to run in O(n) time, and we demonstrate it scalability by discovering acoustic patterns in over 522 hours of audio.",1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation,[0],[0]
"A sub-field within speech processing that has garnered much attention recently is unsupervised

speech pattern discovery.",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"Segmental Dynamic Time Warping (S-DTW) was introduced by Park and Glass (2008), which discovers repetitions of the same words and phrases in a collection of untranscribed acoustic data.",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"Many subsequent efforts extended these ideas (Jansen et al., 2010; Jansen and Van Durme, 2011; Dredze et al., 2010; Harwath et al., 2012; Zhang and Glass, 2009).",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"Alternative approaches based on Bayesian nonparametric modeling (Lee and Glass, 2012; Ondel et al., 2016) employed a generative model to cluster acoustic segments into phoneme-like categories, and related works aimed to segment and cluster either reference or learned phonemelike tokens into higher-level units (Johnson, 2008; Goldwater et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2015).
",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"While supervised object detection is a standard problem in the vision community, several recent works have tackled the problem of weaklysupervised or unsupervised object localization (Bergamo et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015; Cinbis et al., 2016).",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"Although the focus of this work is discovering acoustic patterns, in the process we jointly associate the acoustic patterns with clusters of image crops, which we demonstrate capture visual patterns as well.
",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
The computer vision and NLP communities have begun to leverage deep learning to create multimodal models of images and text.,1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"Many works have focused on generating annotations or text captions for images (Socher and Li, 2010; Frome et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2014; Karpathy et al., 2014; Karpathy and Li, 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2016).",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"One interesting intersection between word induction from phoneme strings and multimodal modeling of images and text is that of Gelderloos and Chrupaa (2016), who uses images to segment words within captions at the phoneme string level.",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"Other work has taken these ideas beyond text, and attempted to relate images to spoken audio captions directly at the waveform level (Roy, 2003; Harwath and Glass, 2015; Harwath et al., 2016).",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"The work of (Harwath et al., 2016) is the most similar to ours, in which the authors learned embeddings at the entire image and entire spoken caption level and then used the embeddings to perform bidirectional retrieval.",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"In this work, we go further by automatically segmenting and clustering the spoken captions into individual word-like units, as well as the images into object-like categories.",1.2 Previous Work,[0],[0]
"We employ a corpus of over 200,000 spoken captions for images taken from the Places205 dataset (Zhou et al., 2014), corresponding to over 522 hours of speech data.",2 Experimental Data,[0],[0]
"The captions were collected using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service, in which workers were shown images and asked to describe them verbally in a free-form manner.",2 Experimental Data,[0],[0]
"The data collection scheme is described in detail in Harwath et al. (2016), but the experiments in this paper leverage nearly twice the amount of data.",2 Experimental Data,[0],[0]
"For training our multimodal neural network as well as the pattern discovery experiments, we use a subset of 214,585 image/caption pairs, and we hold out a set of 1,000 pairs for evaluating the multimodal network’s retrieval ability.",2 Experimental Data,[0],[0]
"Because we lack ground truth text transcripts for the data, we used Google’s Speech Recognition public API to generate proxy transcripts which we use when analyzing our system.",2 Experimental Data,[0],[0]
"Note that the ASR was only used for analysis of the results, and was not involved in any of the learning.",2 Experimental Data,[0],[0]
"We first train a deep multimodal embedding network similar in spirit to the one described in Harwath et al. (2016), but with a more sophisticated architecture.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The model is trained to map entire image frames and entire spoken captions into a shared embedding space; however, as we will show, the trained network can then be used to localize patterns corresponding to words and phrases within the spectrogram, as well as visual objects within the image by applying it to small sub-regions of the image and spectrogram.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The model is comprised of two branches, one which takes as input images, and the other which takes as input spectrograms.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The image network is formed by taking the off-the-shelf VGG 16 layer network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) and replacing the softmax classification layer with a linear transform which maps the 4096-dimensional activations of the second fully connected layer into our 1024-dimensional multimodal embedding space.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, the weights of this projection layer are trained, but the layers taken from the VGG network below it are kept fixed.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
The second branch of our network analyzes speech spectrograms as if they were black and white images.,3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Our spectrograms are computed using 40 log Mel
filterbanks with a 25ms Hamming window and a 10ms shift.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The input to this branch always has 1 color channel and is always 40 pixels high (corresponding to the 40 Mel filterbanks), but the width of the spectrogram varies depending upon the duration of the spoken caption, with each pixel corresponding to approximately 10 milliseconds worth of audio.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The architecture we use is entirely convolutional and shown below, where C denotes the number of convolutional channels, W is filter width, H is filter height, and S is pooling stride.

"Additionally, both the images and spectrograms are mean normalized before training.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The overall multimodal network is formed by tying together the image and audio branches with a layer which takes both of their output vectors and computes an inner product between them, representing the similarity score between a given image/caption pair.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We train the network to assign high scores to matching image/caption pairs, and lower scores to mismatched pairs.
",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Within a minibatch of B image/caption pairs, let Spj , j = 1, . . .",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
", B denote the similarity score of the jth image/caption pair as output by the neural network.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Next, for each pair we randomly sample one impostor caption and one impostor image from the same minibatch.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Let Sij denote the similarity score between the jth caption and its impostor image, and Scj be the similarity score between the jth image and its impostor caption.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]

We train the neural network with 50 epochs of stochastic gradient descent using a batch size B =
128, a momentum of 0.9, and a learning rate of 1e5 which is set to geometrically decay by a factor between 2 and 5 every 5 to 10 epochs.",3 Audio-Visual Embedding Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Although we have trained our multimodal network to compute embeddings at the granularity of entire images and entire caption spectrograms, we can easily apply it in a more localized fashion.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"In the case of images, we can simply take any arbitrary crop of an original image and resize it to 224x224 pixels.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"The audio network is even more trivial to apply locally, because it is entirely convolutional and the final mean pooling layer ensures that the output will be a 1024-dim vector no matter the extent of the input.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"The bigger question is where to locally apply the networks in order to discover meaningful acoustic and visual patterns.
",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Given an image and its corresponding spoken audio caption, we use the term grounding to refer to extracting meaningful segments from the caption and associating them with an appropriate subregion of the image.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"For example, if an image depicted a person eating ice cream and its caption contained the spoken words “A person is enjoying some ice cream,” an ideal set of groundings would entail the acoustic segment containing the word “person” linked to a bounding box around the person, and the segment containing the word “ice cream” linked to a box around the ice cream.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
We use a constrained brute force ranking scheme to evaluate all possible groundings (with a restricted granularity) between an image and its caption.,4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we divide the image into a grid, and extract all of the image crops whose boundaries sit on the grid lines.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Because we are mainly interested in extracting regions of interest and not high precision object detection boxes, to keep the number of proposal regions under control we impose several restrictions.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"First, we use a 10x10 grid on each image regardless of its original size.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Second, we define minimum and maximum aspect ratios as 2:3 and 3:2 so as not to introduce too much distortion and also to reduce the number of proposal boxes.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Third, we define a minimum bounding width as 30% of the original image width, and similarly a minimum height as 30% of the original image height.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"In practice, this results in a few thousand proposal regions per image.
",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"To extract proposal segments from the audio
caption spectrogram, we similarly define a 1-dim grid along the time axis, and consider all possible start/end points at 10 frame (pixel) intervals.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"We impose minimum and maximum segment length constraints at 50 and 100 frames (pixels), implying that our discovered acoustic patterns are restricted to fall between 0.5 and 1 second in duration.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"The number of proposal segments will vary depending on the caption length, and typically number in the several thousands.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Note that when learning groundings we consider the entire audio sequence, and do not incorporate the 10sec duration constraint imposed during training.
",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Once we have extracted a set of proposed visual bounding boxes and acoustic segments for a given image/caption pair, we use our multimodal network to compute a similarity score between each unique image crop/acoustic segment pair.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Each triplet of an image crop, acoustic segment, and similarity score constitutes a proposed grounding.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"A naive approach would be to simply keep the top N groundings from this list, but in practice we ran into two problems with this strategy.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"First, many proposed acoustic segments capture mostly silence due to pauses present in natural speech.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"We solve this issue by using a simple voice activity detector (VAD) which was trained on the TIMIT corpus(Garofolo et al., 1993).",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"If the VAD estimates that 40% or more of any proposed acoustic segment is silence, we discard that entire grounding.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
The second problem we ran into is the fact that the top of the sorted grounding list is dominated by highly overlapping acoustic segments.,4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"This makes sense, because highly informative content words will show up in many different groundings with slightly perturbed start or end times.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"To alleviate this issue, when evaluating a grounding from the top of the proposal list we compare the interval intersection over union (IOU) of its acoustic segment against all acoustic segments already accepted for further consideration.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"If the IOU exceeds a threshold of 0.1, we discard the new grounding and continue moving down the list.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"We stop accumulating groundings once the scores fall to below 50% of the top score in the “keep” list, or when 10 groundings have been added to the “keep” list.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Figure 1 displays a pictorial example of our grounding procedure.
",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"Once we have completed the grounding procedure, we are left with a small set of regions of interest in each image and caption spectrogram.
",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
We use the respective branches of our multimodal network to compute embedding vectors for each grounding’s image crop and acoustic segment.,4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
We then employ k-means clustering separately on the collection of image embedding vectors as well as the collection of acoustic embedding vectors.,4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"The last step is to establish an affinity score between each image cluster I and each acoustic cluster A; we do so using the equation
Affinity(I,A) = ∑
i∈I
∑ a∈A",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]

"After clustering, we are left with a set of acoustic pattern clusters, a set of visual pattern clusters, and a set of linkages describing which acoustic clusters are associated with which image clusters.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"In the next section, we investigate these clusters in more detail.",4 Finding and Clustering Audio-Visual Caption Groundings,[0],[0]
"We trained our multimodal network on a set of 214,585 image/caption pairs, and vetted it with an image search (given caption, find image) and annotation (given image, find caption) task similar to the one used in Harwath et al.

"We performed the grounding and pattern clustering steps on the entire training dataset, which resulted in a total of 1,161,305 unique grounding pairs.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]
"For evaluation, we wish to assign a label to each cluster and cluster member, but this is not completely straightforward since each acoustic segment may capture part of a word, a whole word, multiple words, etc.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]

"Because our experiments revolve around the discovery of word and object categories, a key question to address is the extent to which the supervision used to train the VGG network constrains or influences the kinds of objects learned.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Because the 1,000 object classes from the ILSVRC2012 task (Russakovsky et al., 2015) used to train the VGG network were derived from WordNet synsets (Fellbaum, 1998), we can measure the semantic similarity between the words
learned by our network and the ILSVRC2012 class labels by using synset similarity measures within WordNet.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We do this by first building a list of the 1,000 WordNet synsets associated with the ILSVRC2012 classes.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We then take the set of unique majority-vote labels associated with the discovered word clusters for k = 500, filtered by setting a threshold on their variance (σ2 ≤ 0.65) so as to get rid of garbage clusters, leaving us with 197 unique acoustic cluster labels.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We then look up each cluster label in WordNet, and compare all noun senses of the label to every ILSVRC2012 class synset according to the path similarity measure.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This measure describes the distance between two synsets in a hyponym/hypernym hierarchy, where a score of 1 represents identity and lower scores indicate less similarity.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]

"Of the 197 unique cluster labels, only 16 had a distance of 1 from any ILSVRC12 class, which would indicate an exact match.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]

other words, more than two thirds of the highly pure pattern clusters learned by our network were dissimilar to all of the 1,000 ILSVRC12 classes used to pretrain the VGG network, indicating that our model is able to generalize far beyond the set of classes found in the ILSVRC12 data.",5 Experiments and Analysis,[0],[0]

cluster acoustic patterns representing words or short phrases in untranscribed audio data.",6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]

"We have shown that the shared multimodal embedding space learned by our model is discriminative not only across visual object categories, but also acoustically and semantically across spoken words.
",6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
The future directions in which this research could be taken are incredibly fertile.,6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Because our method creates a segmentation as well as an alignment between images and their spoken captions, a generative model could be trained using these alignments.",6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
"The model could provide a spoken caption for an arbitrary image, or even synthesize an image given a spoken description.",6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Modeling improvements are also possible, aimed at the goal of incorporating both visual and acoustic localization into the neural network itself.",6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
"The same framework we use here could be extended to video, enabling the learning of actions, verbs, environmental sounds, and the like.",6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Additionally, by collecting a second dataset of captions for our images in a different language, such as Spanish, our model could be extended to learn the acoustic correspondences for a given object category in both languages.",6 Conclusions and Future Work,[0],[0]

Unsupervised word alignment (WA) on bilingual sentence pairs serves as an essential foundation for building most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A lot of methods have been proposed to raise the accuracy of WA in an effort to improve end-to-end translation quality.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper contributes to this effort through refining the widely used expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for WA (Dempster et al., 1977; Brown et al., 1993b; Och and Ney, 2000).

The EM algorithm for WA has a great influence in SMT.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Many well-known toolkits including GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), the Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al., 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007), Fast Align (Dyer et al., 2013) and SyMGIZA++ (Junczys-Dowmunt and Sza, 2012), all employ this algorithm.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
GIZA++,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"in particular is frequently used in systems participating in many shared tasks (Goto et al., 2011; Cettolo et al., 2013; Bojar et al., 2013).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the EM algorithm for WA is wellknown for introducing “garbage collector effects.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Rare words have a tendency to collect garbage, that is they have a tendency to be erroneously aligned to untranslated words (Brown et al., 1993a; Moore, 2004; Ganchev et al., 2008; V Graça et al., 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Figure 1(a) shows a real sentence pair, denoted s, from the GALE ChineseEnglish Word Alignment and Tagging Training corpus (GALE WA corpus)1 with it’s humanannotated word alignment.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The Chinese word “HE ZHANG,” denoted wr, which means river custodian, only occurs once in the whole corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We performed EM training using GIZA++ on this corpus concatenated with 442,967 training sentence pairs from the NIST Open Machine Translation (OpenMT) 2006 evaluation2.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The resulting alignment is shown in Figure 1(b).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It can be seen that wr is erroneously aligned to multiple English words.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To find the cause of this, we checked the alignments in each iteration i of s, denoted ais.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We found that in a1s , wr together with the other source-side words were aligned with uniform probability to all the target-side words since the alignment models provided no prior information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, in a2s , wr became erroneously aligned,

because the alignment distribution3 of wr was only learned from a1s , thus consisted of non-zero values only for generating the target-side words in s. Therefore, the alignment probabilities from the rare word wr to the unaligned words in s were extraordinarily high, since almost all of the probability mass was distributed among them.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In other words, the story behind these garbage collector effects is that erroneous alignments are able to provide support for themselves; the probability distribution learned only from s is re-applied to s. In this way, these “garbage collector effects” are a form of over-fitting.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Motivated by this observation, we propose a leave-one-out EM algorithm for WA in this paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recently this technique has been applied to avoid over-fitting in kernel density estimation (Roux and Bach, 2011); instead of performing maximum likelihood estimation, maximum leaveone-out likelihood estimation is performed.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Figure 1(c) shows the effect of using our technique on the example.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The garbage collection has not occurred, and the alignment of the word “HE ZHANG” is identical to the human annotation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The most related work to this paper is training phrase translation models with leave-one-out forced alignment (Wuebker et al., 2010; Wuebker et al., 2012).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The differences are that their work operates at the phrase level, and their aim is to improve translation models; while our work operates at the word level, and our aim is to provide better word alignment.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As word alignment is a foundation of most MT systems, our method have a wider application.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recently, better estimation methods during the maximization step of EM have been proposed to avoid the over-fitting in WA, such as using Kneser-Ney Smoothing to back-off the expected counts (Zhang and Chiang, 2014) or integrating the smoothed l0 prior to the estimation of probability (Vaswani et al., 2012).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work differs from theirs by addressing the over-fitting directly in the EM algorithm by adopting a leave-one-out approach.

Multilingual topic models enable document analysis across languages through coherent multilingual summaries of the data. However, there is no standard and effective metric to evaluate the quality of multilingual topics. We introduce a new intrinsic evaluation of multilingual topic models that correlates well with human judgments of multilingual topic coherence as well as performance in downstream applications. Importantly, we also study evaluation for low-resource languages. Because standard metrics fail to accurately measure topic quality when robust external resources are unavailable, we propose an adaptation model that improves the accuracy and reliability of these metrics in low-resource settings.",text,[0],[0]

"These models discover topics that are consistent across languages, providing useful tools for multilingual text analysis (Vulić et al., 2015), such as detecting cultural differences (Gutiérrez et al., 2016) and bilingual dictionary extraction (Liu et al., 2015).

"Monolingual topic models can be evaluated through likelihood (Wallach et al., 2009b) or coherence (Newman et al., 2010), but topic model evaluation is not well understood in multilingual settings.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our contributions are two-fold.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We introduce an improved intrinsic evaluation metric for multilingual topic models, called Crosslingual Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (CNPMI, Section 2).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We explore the behaviors of CNPMI at both the model and topic levels with six language pairs and varying model specifications.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This metric
correlates well with human judgments and crosslingual classification results (Sections 5 and 6).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We also focus on evaluation in low-resource languages, which lack large parallel corpora, dictionaries, and other tools that are often used in learning and evaluating topic models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To adapt CNPMI to these settings, we create a coherence estimator (Section 3) that extrapolates statistics derived from antiquated, specialized texts like the Bible: often the only resource available for many languages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A multilingual topic contains one topic for each language.,2 Evaluating Multilingual Coherence,[0],[0]
"For a multilingual topic to be meaningful to humans (Figure 1), the meanings should be consistent across the languages, in addition to coherent within each language (i.e., all words in a topic are related).

"Probabilistic topic models associate each document in a corpus with a distribution over latent topics, while each topic is associated with a distribution over words in the vocabulary.",2.1 Multilingual Topic Modeling,[0],[0]
"The most widely used topic model, latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003, LDA), can be extended to connect languages.",2.1 Multilingual Topic Modeling,[0],[0]
"These extensions require additional knowledge to link languages together.
",2.1 Multilingual Topic Modeling,[0],[0]
"One common encoding of multilingual knowledge is document links (indicators that documents are parallel or comparable), used in polylingual topic models (Mimno et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2009).",2.1 Multilingual Topic Modeling,[0],[0]

"Since the polylingual topic model is the most common approach for building multilingual topic models (Vulić et al., 2013, 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Krstovski and Smith, 2016), our study will focus on this model.",2.1 Multilingual Topic Modeling,[0],[0]

"We then propose an extension of NPMI that addresses these limitations.
",2.3 Existing Multilingual Evaluations,[0],[0]
Internal Coherence.,2.3 Existing Multilingual Evaluations,[0],[0]
A simple adaptation of NPMI is to calculate the monolingual NPMI score for each language independently and take the average.,2.3 Existing Multilingual Evaluations,[0],[0]
We refer this as internal NPMI (INPMI) as it evaluates coherence within a language.,2.3 Existing Multilingual Evaluations,[0],[0]

"A multilingually coherent topic means that if wi,`1 in language `1 and wj,`2 in language `2 are in the same topic, they should appear in similar contexts in comparable or parallel corporaR(`1,`2).

"Our adaptation of NPMI is based on the same principles as the monolingual version, but focuses on the co-occurrences of bilingual word pairs.",2.4 New Metric: Crosslingual NPMI,[0],[0]
"Given a bilingual word pair (wi,`1 ,wj,`2) the co-occurrence of this word pair is the event where word wi,`1 appears in a document in language `1 and the word wj,`2 appears in a comparable or parallel document in language `2.

"The co-occurrence probability of each bilingual word pair is:
Pr (wi,`1 ,wj,`2) , ∣∣{d : wi,`1 ∈ d(`1),wj,`2 ∈ d(`2) }∣∣ ∣∣R(`1,`2) ∣∣ , (3)
where d = ( d(`1), d(`2) ) is a pair of parallel/comparable documents in the reference corpus R(`1,`2).",2.4 New Metric: Crosslingual NPMI,[0],[0]
"When one or both words in a bilingual pair do not appear in the reference corpus, the cooccurrence score is zero.

It is straightforward to generalize CNPMI from a language pair to multiple languages by averaging CNPMI(`i, `j , k) over all language pairs (`i, `j).",2.4 New Metric: Crosslingual NPMI,[0],[0]
CNPMI needs a reference corpus for co-occurrence statistics.,3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]

"It is good at evaluating topics such as family and religion, but not “modern” topics like biology and Internet.",3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
"Without reference co-occurrence statistics relevant to these topics, CNPMI will fail to judge topic coherence—it must give the ambiguous answer of zero.",3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
"Such a score could mean a totally incoherent topic where each word pair never appears together (Topics 6 in Figure 1), or an unjudgeable topic (Topic 5).
",3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
Our goal is to obtain a reliable estimation of topic coherence for low-resource languages when the Bible is the only reference.,3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
We propose a model that can correct the drawbacks of a Bible-derived CNPMI.,3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
"While we assume bilingual topics paired with English, our approach can be applied to any high-resource/low-resource language pair.
",3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
We take Wikipedia’s CNPMI from high-resource languages as accurate estimations.,3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
"We then build a coherence estimator on topics from high-resource languages, with the Wikipedia CNPMI as the target output.",3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
We use linear regression using the below features.,3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
"Given a topic in low-resource language, the estimator produces an estimated coherence (Figure 2).",3 Adapting to Low-Resource Languages,[0],[0]
The key to the estimator is to find features that capture whether we should trust the Bible.,3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"For generality, we focus on features independent of the available resources other than the Bible.",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"This section describes the features, which we split into four groups.
",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
Base Features (BASE),3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"Our base features include information we can collect from the Bible and the topic model: cardinality C, CNPMI and INPMI, MTA, and topic word coverage (TWC), which counts the percentage of topic words in a topic that appear in a reference corpus.
Crosslingual Gap (GAP) A low CNPMI score could indicate a topic pair where each language has a monolingually coherent topic but that are not about the same theme (Topic 6 in Figure 1).",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"Thus, we add two features to capture this information

using the Bible: mismatch coefficients (MC) and internal comparison coefficients (ICC):
MC(`1; `2, k) = CNPMI(`1, `2, k)
INPMI(`1, k) + α , (5)

"ICC(`1, `2, k) = INPMI(`1, k) + α
INPMI(`2, k) + α , (6)
where α is a smoothing factor (α = 0.001 in our experiments).",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"MC recognizes the gap between crosslingual and monolingual coherence, so a higher MC score indicates a gap between coherence within and across languages.",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"Similarly, ICC compares monolingual coherence to tell if both languages are coherent: the closer to 1 the ICC is, the more comparable internal coherence both languages have.
",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"Word Era (ERA) Because the Bible’s vocabulary is unable to evaluate modern topics, we must tell the model what the modern words are.",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
The word era features are the earliest usage year 3 for each word in a topic.,3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"We use both the mean and standard deviation as features.
",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
Meaning Drift (DRIFT).,3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
The meaning of a word can expand and drift over time.,3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"For example, in the Bible, “web” appears in Isaiah 59:5:
They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web.
3 https://oxforddictionaries.com/
The word “web” could be evaluated correctly in an animal topic.",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"For modern topics, however, Bible fails to capture modern meanings of “web”, as in Topic 5 (Figure 1).
",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"To address this meaning drift, we use a method similar to Hamilton et al. (2016).",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"For each English word, we calculate the context vector from Bible and from Wikipedia with a window size of five and calculate the cosine similarity between them as word similarity.",3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
Similar context vectors mean that the usage in the Bible is consistent with Wikipedia.,3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
We calculate word similarities for all the English topic words in a topic and use the average and standard deviation as features.,3.1 Estimator Features,[0],[0]
"In Figure 3, Topic 1 is coherent while Topic 8 is not.",3.2 Example,[0],[0]
"From left to right, we incrementally add new feature sets, and show how the estimated topic coherence scores (dashed lines) approach the ideal CNPMI (dotted lines).",3.2 Example,[0],[0]
"When only using the BASE features, the estimator gives a higher prediction to Topic 8 than to Topic 1.",3.2 Example,[0],[0]
Their low MTA and TWC prevent accurate evaluations.,3.2 Example,[0],[0]
Adding GAP does not help much.,3.2 Example,[0],[0]
"However, ICC(EN, AM, k = 1) is much smaller, which might indicate a large gap of internal coherence between the two languages.
",3.2 Example,[0],[0]
Adding ERA makes the estimated scores flip between the two topics.,3.2 Example,[0],[0]
"Topic 1 has word era of 1823, much older than Topic 8’s word era of 1923, in-
dicating that Topic 8 includes modern words the Bible lacks (e.g., “computer”).",3.2 Example,[0],[0]
"Using all the features, the estimator gives more accurate topic coherence evaluations.",3.2 Example,[0],[0]
"We experiment on six languages (Table 1) from three corpora: Romanian (RO) and Swedish (SV) from EuroParl as representative of well-studied and rich-resource languages (Koehn, 2005); Amharic (AM) and Tagalog (TL) from collected news, as lowresource languages (Huang et al., 2002a,b); and Chinese (ZH) and Turkish (TR) from TED Talks 2013 (Tiedemann, 2012), adding language variety to our experiments.",4 Experiments: Bible to Wikipedia,[0],[0]

"Following monolingual coherence evaluations (Lau et al., 2014), we present topic pairs to bilingual CrowdFlower users.",5.1 Task Design,[0],[0]
Each task is a topic pair with the top ten topic words (C = 10) for each language.,5.1 Task Design,[0],[0]
"We ask if both languages’ top words in a multilingual topic are talking about the same concept (Figure 4), and make a judgment on a three-point scale—coherent (2 points), somewhat coherent (1 point), and incoherent (0 points).",5.1 Task Design,[0],[0]
"To ensure the users have adequate language competency, we insert several topics that are easily identifiable as incoherent as a qualification test.
",5.1 Task Design,[0],[0]
"We randomly select sixty topics from each language pair (360 topics total), and each topic is judged by five users.",5.1 Task Design,[0],[0]
We take the average of the judgment points and calculate Pearson correlations with the proposed evaluation metrics (Table 2).,5.1 Task Design,[0],[0]
NPMI-based scores are separately calculated from each reference corpus.,5.1 Task Design,[0],[0]

"Next, we compare CNPMI to two baselines: INPMI and MTA.",5.2 Agreement with Human Judgments,[0],[0]
"As expected, CNPMI outperforms INPMI regardless of reference corpus overall, because INPMI only considers monolingual coherence.",5.2 Agreement with Human Judgments,[0],[0]
"MTA has higher correlations than CNPMI
scores from the Bible, because the Bible fails to give accurate estimates due to limited topic coverage.",5.2 Agreement with Human Judgments,[0],[0]
"MTA, on the other hand, only depends on dictionaries, which are more comprehensive than the Bible.",5.2 Agreement with Human Judgments,[0],[0]
"It is also possible that users are judging coherence based on translations across a topic pair, rather than the overall coherence, which would closely correlate with MTA.",5.2 Agreement with Human Judgments,[0],[0]

Semantics We take two examples with EN-ZH (Topic 1) and EN-TL (Topic 2) in Figure 5.,5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"Topic 1 has fewer translation pairs than Topic 2, which leads to a lower MTA score for Topic 1.",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]

"Cardinality Increasing cardinality diminishes a topic’s coherence (Lau and Baldwin, 2016).",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
We vary the cardinality of topics from ten to fifty at intervals of ten (Figure 6).,5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"As cardinality increases, more low-probability and irrelevant words appear the topic, which lowers CNPMI scores.",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"However, MTA stays stable or increases with increasing cardinality.",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"Thus, MTA fails to fulfill a critical property of topic model evaluation.
",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"Finally, MTA requires a comprehensive multilingual dictionary, which may be unavailable for lowresource languages.",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"Additionally, most languages often only have one dictionary, which makes it problematic to use the same resource (a language’s single multilingual dictionary) for training and evaluating models that use a dictionary to build multilingual topics (Hu et al., 2014).",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"Given these concerns, we continue the paper’s focus on CNPMI as a data-driven alternative to MTA.",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"However, for many applications MTA may suffice as a simple, adequate evaluation metric.",5.4 When MTA Falls Short,[0],[0]
"While the previous section looked at individual topics, we also care about how well CNPMI characterizes the quality of models through an average of a model’s constituent topics.",6 Model-Level Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Adding more knowledge to multilingual topic models improves topics (Hu et al., 2014), so an effective evaluation should reflect this improvement as knowlege is added to the model.",6.1 Training Knowledge,[0],[0]

applications, and topic model evaluations should reflect whether these features are useful (Ramage et al., 2009).",6.2 Agreement with Machines,[0],[0]
"For each model, we apply a document classifier trained on the model parameters to test whether CNPMI is consistent with classification accuracy.
",6.2 Agreement with Machines,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we want our classifier to transfer information from training on one language to testing on another (Smet et al., 2011; Heyman et al., 2016).",6.2 Agreement with Machines,[0],[0]
"We train a classifier on one language’s documents, where each document’s feature vector is the document-topic distribution θd.",6.2 Agreement with Machines,[0],[0]
"We apply this to TED Talks, where each document is labeled with multiple categories.",6.2 Agreement with Machines,[0],[0]
"We choose the most frequent seven categories across the corpus as labels,5 and only have labeled documents in one side of a bilingual topic model.",6.2 Agreement with Machines,[0],[0]
"CNPMI has very strong correlations with classification results, though using the Bible as the reference corpus gives slightly lower correlation—with higher variance— than Wikipedia (Figure 8).",6.2 Agreement with Machines,[0],[0]
"In Section 5.3, we improve Bible-based CNPMI scores for individual topics.",6.3 Re-Estimating Model-Level Coherence,[0],[0]

"We apply the estimator on the models created in Section 6.2 and calculate the correlation between estimated scores and Wikipedia’s CNPMI (Table 4).
",6.3 Re-Estimating Model-Level Coherence,[0],[0]
The coherence estimator substantially improves scores except for Turkish: the correlation is better before applying the estimator (0.911).,6.3 Re-Estimating Model-Level Coherence,[0],[0]
"We suspect a lack of overlap between topics between Turkish and languages other than Chinese is to blame (Figure 9); the features used by the estimator do not generalize well to other kinds of features; training on many languages pairs would hopefully solve this

"Turkish is also morphologically rich, and our preprocessing completely ignores morphology.",6.3 Re-Estimating Model-Level Coherence,[0],[0]
"One challenge with low-resource languages is that even if Wikipedia is available, it may have too few documents to accurately calculate coherence.",6.4 Reference Size,[0],[0]
"As a final analysis, we examine how the reliability of CNPMI degrades with a smaller reference corpus.
",6.4 Reference Size,[0],[0]
"We randomly sample 20% to 100% of document pairs from the reference corpora and evaluate the polylingual topic model with all document links (Figure 10), again fixing the cardinality as 10.

erence documents, as long as the number of reference documents is sufficiently large.",6.4 Reference Size,[0],[0]
"If there are too few reference documents (for example, 20% of Amharic Wikipedia is only 316 documents), then CNPMI degrades.",6.4 Reference Size,[0],[0]
Topic Coherence Many coherence metrics based on co-occurrence statistics have been proposed besides NPMI.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similar metrics—such as asymmetrical word pair metrics (Mimno et al., 2011) and combinations of existing measurements (Lau et al., 2014; Röder et al., 2015)— correlate well with human judgments.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]

"A common task is held-out likelihood (Wallach et al., 2009b; Jagarlamudi and Daumé III, 2010; Fukumasu et al., 2012), but as Chang et al. (2009) show, this does not always reflect human interpretability.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Other specific tasks have also been used, such as bilingual dictionary extraction (Liu et al., 2015; Ma and Nasukawa, 2017), cultural difference deteciton (Gutiérrez et al., 2016), and crosslingual document clustering (Vulić et al., 2015).

The importance of understanding political discourse on social media platforms is becoming increasingly clear.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In recent U.S. presidential elections, Twitter was widely used by all candidates to promote their agenda, interact with supporters, and attack their opponents.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Social interactions on such platforms allow politicians to quickly react to current events and gauge interest in and support for their actions.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These dynamic settings emphasize the importance of constructing automated tools for analyzing this content.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, these same dynamics make constructing such tools difficult, as the language used to discuss new events and political agendas continuously changes.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Consequently, the rich social interactions on Twitter can be leveraged to help support such analysis by providing alternatives to direct supervision.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper we focus on political framing, a very nuanced political discourse analysis task, on
a variety of issues frequently discussed on Twitter.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Framing (Entman, 1993; Chong and Druckman, 2007) is employed by politicians to bias the discussion towards their stance by emphasizing specific aspects of the issue.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, the debate around increasing the minimum wage can be framed as a quality of life issue or as an economic issue.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the first frame supports increasing minimum wage because it improves workers’ lives, the second frame, by conversely emphasizing the costs involved, opposes the increase.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Using framing to analyze political discourse has gathered significant interest over the last few years (Tsur et al., 2015; Card et al., 2015; Baumer et al., 2015) as a way to automatically analyze political discourse in congressional speeches and political news articles.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Different from previous works which focus on these longer texts or single issues, our dataset includes tweets authored by all members of the U.S. Congress from both parties, dealing with several policy issues (e.g., immigration, ACA, etc.).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These tweets were annotated by adapting the annotation guidelines developed by Boydstun et al. (2014) for Twitter.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Twitter issue framing is a challenging multilabel prediction task.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each tweet can be labeled as using one or more frames, out of 17 possibilities, while only providing 140 characters as input to the classifier.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The main contribution of this work is to evaluate whether the social and behavioral information available on Twitter is sufficient for constructing a reliable classifier for this task.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We approach this framing prediction task using a weakly supervised collective classification approach which leverages the dependencies between tweet frame predictions based on the interactions between their authors.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These dependencies are modeled by connecting Twitter users who have social connections or behavioral similarities.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Social connections are di-
741
rected dependencies that represent the followers of each user as well as retweeting behavior (i.e., user A retweets user B’s content).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, such social connections capture the flow of influence within political parties; however, the number of connections that cross party lines is extremely low.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead, we rely on capturing behavioral similarity between users to provide this information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, users whose Twitter activity peaks at similar times tend to discuss issues in similar ways, providing indicators of their frame usage for those issues.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to using social and behavioral information, our approach also incorporates each politician’s party affiliation and the frequent phrases (e.g., bigrams and trigrams) used by politicians on Twitter.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These lexical, social, and behavioral features are extracted from tweets via weakly supervised models and then declaratively compiled into a graphical model using Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), a recently introduced probabilistic modeling framework.1 As described in Section 4, PSL specifies high level rules over a relational representation of these features.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These rules are then compiled into a graphical model called a hingeloss Markov random field (Bach et al., 2013), which is used to make the frame prediction.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead of direct supervision we take a bootstrapping approach by providing a small seed set of keywords adapted from Boydstun et al. (2014), for each frame.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our experiments show that modeling social and behavioral connections improves F1 prediction scores in both supervised and unsupervised settings, with double the increase in the latter.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We apply our unsupervised model to our entire dataset of tweets to analyze framing patterns over time by both party and individual politicians.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our analysis provides insight into the usage of framing for identification of aisle-crossing politicians, i.e., those politicians who vote against their party.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Issue framing is related to the broader challenges of biased language analysis (Recasens et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2012; Greene and Resnik, 2009) and subjectivity (Wiebe et al., 2004).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Several previous works have explored framing in public statements, congressional speeches, and news articles (Fulgoni et al., 2016; Tsur et al., 2015; Card

In recent years there has been growing interest in analyzing political discourse.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Most previous work focuses on opinion mining and stance prediction (Sridhar et al., 2015; Hasan and Ng, 2014; Abu-Jbara et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2012; Abbott et al., 2011; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010, 2009).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Analyzing political tweets has also attracted considerable interest: a recent SemEval task looked into stance prediction,2 and more related to our work, Tan et al. (2014) have shown how wording choices can affect message propagation on Twitter.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Two recent works look into predicting stance (at user and tweet levels respectively) on Twitter using PSL (Johnson and Goldwasser, 2016; Ebrahimi et al., 2016).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Frame classification, however, has a finer granularity than stance classification and describes how someone expresses their view on an issue, not whether they support the issue.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Other works focus on identifying and measuring political ideologies (Iyyer et al., 2014; Bamman and Smith, 2015; Sim et al., 2013), policies (Nguyen et al., 2015), and voting patterns (Gerrish and Blei, 2012).

"Exploiting social interactions and group structure for prediction has also been explored (Sridhar et al., 2015; Abu-Jbara et al., 2013; West et al., 2014).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Works focusing on inferring signed social networks (West et al., 2014), stance classification (Sridhar et al., 2015), social group modeling (Huang et al., 2012), and collective classification using PSL (Bach et al., 2015) are closest to our approach.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Unsupervised and weakly supervised models of Twitter data for several various tasks have been suggested, including: profile (Li et al., 2014b) and life event extraction (Li et al., 2014a), conversation modeling (Ritter et al., 2010), and methods for dealing with the unique language used in microblogs (Eisenstein, 2013).

"Using an average of ten keywords per issue, we filtered out tweets not related to the following six issues of interest: (1) limiting or gaining access to abortion, (2) debates concerning the Affordable Care Act (i.e., ACA or Obamacare), (3) the issue of gun rights versus gun control, (4) effects of immigration policies, (5) acts of terrorism, and (6) issues concerning the LGBTQ community.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]

Data Annotation: Two graduate students were trained in the use of the Policy Frames Codebook developed by Boydstun et al. (2014) for annotating each tweet with a frame.,3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
The general aspects of each frame are shown in Table 2.,3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
Frames are designed to generalize across issues and overlap of multiple frames is possible.,3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Additionally, the Codebook is typically applied to newspaper ar-

ticles where discussion of policy can encompass other frames in the text.,3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Consequently, annotators using the Codebook are advised to be careful when assigning Frame 13 to a text.
",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Based on this guidance and the difficulty of labeling tweets (as discussed in Card et al. (2015)), annotators were instructed to use the following procedure: (1) attempt to assign a primary frame to the tweet if possible, (2) if not possible, assign two frames to the tweet where the first frame is chosen as the more accurate of the two frames, (3) when assigning frames 12 through 17, double check that the tweet cannot be assigned to any other frames.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
Annotators spent one month labeling the randomly chosen tweets.,3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"For all tweets with more than one frame, annotators met to come to a consensus on whether the tweet should have one frame or both.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"The labeled dataset has an inter-annotator agreement, calculated using Cohen’s Kappa statistic, of 73.4%.

"Tweets that present a fact, with no detectable political spin or twists, are labeled as having the Factual frame (15).",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Tweets that discuss a politician’s appearances, speeches, statements, or refer to political friends are considered to have the (Self) Promotion frame.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Finally, tweets where a politician offers their “thoughts and prayers”, condolences, or stands in support of others, are considered to have the Personal frame.
",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"We find that for many tweets, one frame is not enough.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"This is caused by the compound nature of many tweets, e.g., some tweets are two separate sentences, with each sentence having a different frame or tweets begin with one frame and end with another.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"A final problem, that may also be relevant to longer text articles, is that of subframes within a larger frame.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"For example, the tweet “We must bolster the security of our borders and craft an immigration policy that grows our economy.”",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
has two frames: Security & Defense and Economic.,3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"However, both frames could fall under Frame 13 (Policy), if this tweet as a whole was a rebuttal point about an immigration policy.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"The lack of
available context for short tweets can make it difficult to determine if a tweet should have one primary frame or is more accurately represented by multiple frames.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Due to the dynamic nature of political discourse on Twitter, our approach is designed to require as little supervision as possible.",4 Global Models of Twitter Language and Activity,[0],[0]
We implement 6 weakly supervised models which are datadependent and used to extract and format information from tweets into input for PSL predicates.,4 Global Models of Twitter Language and Activity,[0],[0]
These predicates are then combined into the probabilistic rules of each model as shown in Table 3.,4 Global Models of Twitter Language and Activity,[0],[0]

"Unigrams: Using the guidelines provided in the Policy Frames Codebook (Boydstun et al., 2014), we adapted a list of expected unigrams for each frame.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"For example, unigrams that should be related to Frame 12 (Political Factors & Implications) include: filibuster, lobby, Democrats, Republicans.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"We expect that if a tweet and frame contain a matching unigram, then that frame is likely present in that tweet.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"The information that tweet T has expected unigram U of frame F is represented with the PSL predicate: UNIGRAMF (T, U).",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"This knowledge is then used as input to PSL Model 1 via the rule: UNIGRAMF (T, U) !",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"FRAME(T, F) (shown in line 1 of Table 3).
",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"However, not every tweet will have a unigram that matches those in this list.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"Under the intuition that at least one unigram in a tweet should be similar to a unigram in the list, we designed the following MaxSim metric to compute the maximum similarity between a word in a tweet and a word from the list of unigrams.
MAXSIM(T, F) = arg max u2F,w2T SIMILARITY(W,U)
(1) T is a tweet, W is each word in T, and U is each unigram in the list of expected unigrams (per frame).",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
SIMILARITY is the computed word2vec similarity (using pretrained embeddings) of each word in the tweet with every unigram in the list of unigrams for each frame.,4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"The frame F of the maximum scoring unigram is input to the PSL predicate: MAXSIMF (T, F), which indicates that tweet T has the highest similarity to frame F.
Bigrams and Trigrams:",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"In addition to unigrams, we also explored the effects of political party slogans on frame prediction.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
Slogans are common catch phrases or sayings that people typically associate with different U.S. political parties.,4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"For example, Republicans are known for using the phrase “repeal and replace” when they discuss the ACA.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"Similarly, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Secretary Hillary Clinton’s campaign slogan became “Love Trumps Hate”.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"To visualize slogan usage by parties for different issues, we used the entire tweets dataset, including all unlabeled tweets, to extract the top bigrams
and trigrams per party for each issue.",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
The histograms in Figure 1 show these distributions for the top 100 bigrams and trigrams.,4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"Based on these results, we use the top 20 bigrams (e.g., women’s healthcare and immigration reform) and trigrams (e.g. prevent gun violence) as input to PSL predicates BIGRAMIP (T, B) and TRIGRAMIP (T, TG).",4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
These rules represent that tweet T has bigram B or trigram TG from the respective issue I phrase lists of either party P.,4.2 Language Based Models,[0],[0]
"In addition to language based features of tweets, we also exploit the behavioral and social features of Twitter including similarities between temporal activity and network relationships.
",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
Temporal Similarity: We construct a temporal histogram for each politician which captures their Twitter activity over time.,4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
When an event happens politicians are most likely to tweet about that event within hours of its occurrence.,4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"Similarly, most politicians tweet about the event most frequently the day of the event and this frequency decreases over time.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"From these temporal histograms, we observed that the frames used the day of an event were similar and gradually changed over time.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"For example, once the public is notified of a shooting, politicians respond with Frame 17 to offer sympathy to the victims and their families.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"Over the next days or weeks, both parties slowly transition to using additional frames, e.g. Democrats use Frame 7 to argue for gun control legislation.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"To capture this behavior we use the PSL predicate SAMETIME(T1, T2).",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"This indicates that tweet T1 occurs around the same time as tweet
T2.5 This information is used in Model 4 via rules such as: SAMETIME(T1, T2) & FRAME(T1, F) !",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"FRAME(T2, F), as shown in line 4 of Table 3.
",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"Network Similarity: Finally, we expect that politicians who share ideologies, and thus are likely to frame issues similarly, will retweet and/or follow each other on Twitter.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"Due to the compound nature of tweets, retweeting with additional comments can add more frames to the original tweet.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"Additionally, politicians on Twitter are more likely to follow members of their own party or similar non-political entities than those of the opposing party.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"To capture this network-based behavior we use two PSL predicates: RETWEETS(T1, T2) and FOLLOWS(T1, T2).",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"These predicates indicate that the content of tweet T1 includes a retweet of tweet T2 and that the author of T1 follows the author of T2 on Twitter, respectively.",4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
The last two lines of Table 3 show examples of how network similarity is incorporated into PSL rules.,4.3 Twitter Behavior Based Models,[0],[0]
"Evaluation Metrics: Since each tweet can have more than one frame, our prediction task is a multilabel classification task.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The precision of a multilabel model is the ratio of how many predicted labels are correct:
Precision = 1
T
TX

"The recall of this model is the ratio of how many of the actual labels were predicted:

|Yt \ h(xt)|",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"|Yt|
(3)
5We conducted experiments with different hour and day limits and found that using a time frame of one hour results in the best accuracy while limiting noise.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In both formulas, T is the number of tweets, Yt is the true label for tweet t, xt is a tweet example, and h(xt) are the predicted labels for that tweet.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The F1 score is computed as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Additionally, in Tables 4, 5, and 6 the reported average is the micro-weighted average F1 scores over all frames.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Experimental Settings: We provide an analysis of our PSL models under both supervised and unsupervised settings.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In the PSL supervised experiments, we used five-fold cross validation with randomly chosen splits.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Previous works typically use an SVM, with bagof-words features, which is not used in a multilabel prediction, i.e., each frame is predicted individually.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The results of this approach on our dataset are shown in column 2 of Table 4.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In this scenario, the SVM tends to prefer the majority class, which results in many incorrect labels.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Column 3 shows the results of using an SVM with bag-of-words features to perform multilabel classification.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
This approach decreases the F1 score for a majority of frames.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Both SVMs also result in F1 scores of 0 for some frames, further lowering the overall performance.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, columns 4 and 5 show the results of using our worst and best PSL models, respectively.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"PSL Model 1, which uses our adapted unigram features instead of the bag-of-words features for multilabel classification, serves as our baseline to improve upon.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Additionally, Model 6 of the supervised, collective network setting represents the best results we can achieve.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We also explore the results of our PSL models in an unsupervised setting because the highly dynamic nature of political discourse on Twitter makes it unrealistic to expect annotated data to generalize to future discussions.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The only source of supervision comes from the initial unigrams lists and party information as described in Section 4.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The labeled tweets are used for evaluation only.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"As seen in Table 4, we are able to improve
the best unsupervised model to within an F1 score of 7.36 points of the unigram baseline of 66.02, and 19.13 points of the best supervised score of 77.79.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Analysis of Supervised Experiments: Table 5 shows the results of our supervised experiments.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Here we can see that by adding Twitter behavior (beginning with Model 4), our behaviorbased models achieve the best F1 scores across all frames.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Model 4 achieves the highest results on two frames, suggesting retweeting and network follower information do not help improve the prediction score for these frames.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Model 5 achieves the highest prediction for 5 of the frames, suggesting network follower information cannot further improve the score for these frames.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Overall, the Twitter behavior based models are able to outperform language based models alone, including the best performing language model (Model 3) which combines unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams together to collectively infer the correct frames.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Analysis of Unsupervised Experiments: In the unsupervised setting, Model 6, the combination of language and Twitter behavior features achieves the best results on 16 of the 17 issues, as shown in Table 6.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
There are a few interesting aspects of the unsupervised setting which differ from the supervised setting.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Six of the frame predictions do worse in Model 2, which is double that of the supervised version.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is likely due to the presence of overlapping bigrams across frames and issues, e.g., “women’s healthcare” could appear in both Frames 4 and 8 and the issues of ACA and abortion.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, all six are able to improve with the addition of trigrams (Model 3), whereas only 1 of 3 frames improves in the supervised setting.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
This suggests that bigrams may not be as useful as trigrams in an unsupervised setting.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, in Model 5, which adds retweet behaviors, we notice that 5 of the frames decrease in F1 score and 11
of the frames have the same score as the previous model.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
These results suggest that retweet behaviors are not as useful as the follower network relationships in an unsupervised setting.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To explore the usefulness of frame identification in political discourse analysis, we apply our best performing model (Model 6) on the unlabeled dataset to determine framing patterns over time, both by party and individual.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Figure 2 shows the results of our frame analysis for both parties over time for two issues: ACA and terrorism.6 We compiled the predicted frames for tweets from 2014 to 2016 for each party.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Figure 3 presents the results of frame prediction for 2015 tweets of aisle-crossing individual politicians for these two issues.
",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Party Frames: From Figure 2(a) we can see that Democrats mainly use Frames 1, 4, 8, 9, and 15 to discuss ACA, while Figure 2(c) shows that Republicans predominantly use Frames 1, 8, 9, 12, and 13.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Though the parties use similar frames, they are used to express different agendas.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"For example, Democrats use Frame 8 to indicate the positive effect that the ACA has had in granting more Americans health care access.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Republicans, however, use Frame 8 (and Frame 13) to indicate their party’s agenda to replace the ACA with access to different options for health care.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Additionally, Democrats use the Fairness & Equality Frame (Frame 4) to convey that the ACA gives minority groups a better chance at accessing health care.
6Due to space, we omit the other 4 issues.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"These 2 were chosen because they are among the most frequently discussed issues in our dataset.
",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
They also use Frame 15 to express statistics about enrollment of Americans under the ACA.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Finally, Republicans use Frames 12 and 13 to bring attention to their own party’s actions to “repeal and replace” the ACA with different policies.
",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Figures 2(b) and 2(d) show the party-based framing patterns over time for terrorism related tweets.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"For this issue both parties use similar frames: 3, 7, 10, 14, 16, and 17, but to express different views.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"For example, Democrats use Frame 3 to indicate a moral responsibility to fight ISIS.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Republicans use Frame 3 to frame terrorists or their attacks as a result of “radical Islam”.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
An interesting pattern to note is seen in Frames 10 and 14 for both parties.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"In 2015 there is a large in-
crease in the usage of this frame.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"This seems to indicate that parties possibly adopt new frames simultaneously or in response to the opposing party, perhaps in an effort to be in control of the way the message is delivered through that frame.
",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Individual Frames: In addition to entire party analysis, we were interested in seeing if frames could shed light on the behavior of aisle-crossing politicians.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"These are politicians who do not vote the same as the majority vote of their party (i.e., they vote the same as the opposing party).",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Identifying such politicians can be useful in governments which are heavily split by party, i.e., governments such as the recent U.S. Congress (2015 to 2017), where politicians tend to vote the same
as the rest of their party members.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"For this analysis, we collected five 2015 votes from the House of Representatives on both issues and compiled a list of the politicians who voted opposite to their party.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
The most important descriptor we noticed was that all aisle-crossing politicians tweet less frequently on the issue than their fellow party members.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
This is true for both parties.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"This behavior could indicate lack of desire to draw attention to one’s stance on the particular issue.
",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Figure 3(a) shows the framing patterns of aislecrossing Republicans on ACA votes from 2015.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"Recall from Figure 2 that Democrats mostly use Frames 1, 4, 8, 9, and 15, while Republicans mainly use Frames 1, 8, and 9.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"In this example, these Republicans are considered aislecrossing votes because they have voted the same as Democrats on this issue.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"The most interesting pattern to note here is that these Republicans use the same framing patterns as the Republicans (Frames 1, 8, and 9), but they also use the frames that are unique to Democrats: Frames 4 and 15.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
These latter two frames appear significantly less in the Republican tweets of our entire dataset as well.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"These results suggest that to predict aisle-crossing
Republicans it would be useful to check for usage of typically Democrat-associated frames, especially if those frames are infrequently used by Republicans.
",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
Figure 3(b) shows the predicted frames for aisle-crossing Democrats on terrorism-related votes.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"We see here that there are very few tweets from these Democrats on this issue and that overall they use the same framing patterns as seen previously: Frames 3, 7, 10, 14, 16, and 17.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
"However, given the small scale of these tweets, we can also consider Frames 12 and 13 to show peaks for this example.",6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]
This suggests that for aisle-crossing Democrats the use of additional frames not often used by their party for discussing an issue might indicate potentially different voting behaviors.,6 Qualitative Analysis,[0],[0]

"MWE identification is the task of automatically determining which word combinations at the token-level form MWEs (Baldwin and Kim, 2010), and must be able to make such distinctions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is particularly important for applications such as machine translation (Sag et al., 2002), where the appropriate meaning of word combinations in context must be preserved for accurate translation.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, following prior work (e.g., Salton et al., 2016), we frame token-level identification of VNCs as a supervised binary classification problem, i.e., idiomatic vs. literal.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We consider a range of approaches to forming distributed representations of the context in which a VNC occurs, including word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013), word embeddings tailored to representing sentences (Kenter et al., 2016), and skip-thoughts sentence embeddings (Kiros et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We then train a support vector machine (SVM) on these representations to classify unseen VNC instances.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Surprisingly, we find that an approach based on representing sentences as the average of their word embeddings performs comparably to, or better than, the skip-thoughts based approach previously proposed by Salton et al. (2016).
VNCs exhibit lexico-syntactic fixedness.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, the idiomatic interpretation in example 1 above is typically only accessible when the verb see has active voice, the determiner is null, and the noun star is in plural form, as in see stars or seeing stars.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Usages with a determiner (as in example 2), a singular noun (e.g., see a star), or passive voice (e.g., stars were seen) typically only have the literal interpretation.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
In this paper we further incorporate knowledge of the lexico-syntactic fixedness of VNCs — automatically acquired from corpora using the method of Fazly et al. (2009) — into our various embedding-based approaches.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our experimental results show that this leads to substantial improve-
ments, indicating that this rich linguistic knowledge is complementary to that available in distributed representations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Much research on MWE identification has focused on specific kinds of MWEs (e.g., Patrick and Fletcher, 2005; Uchiyama et al., 2005), including English VNCs (e.g., Fazly et al., 2009; Salton et al., 2016), although some recent work has considered the identification of a broad range of kinds of MWEs (e.g., Schneider et al., 2014; Brooke et al., 2014; Savary et al., 2017).

"Work on MWE identification has leveraged rich linguistic knowledge of the constructions under consideration (e.g., Fazly et al., 2009; Fothergill and Baldwin, 2012), treated literal and idiomatic as two senses of an expression and applied approaches similar to word-sense disambiguation (e.g., Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Hashimoto and Kawahara, 2008), incorporated topic models (e.g., Li et al., 2010), and made use of distributed representations of words (Gharbieh et al., 2016).

"In the most closely related work to ours, Salton et al. (2016) represent token instances of VNCs by embedding the sentence that they occur in using skip-thoughts (Kiros et al., 2015) — an encoder– decoder model that can be viewed as a sentencelevel counterpart to the word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) skip-gram model.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"During training the target sentence is encoded using a recurrent neural network, and is used to predict the previous and next sentences.",2 Related work,[0],[0]

"In such cases, it is natural to appeal to side information such as node attributes or features.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"The most closely related model to our Asym-NARM, also extending the BGGPF algorithm, is SSI-PF.",4. Related work,[0],[0]
But it uses the gamma additivity to construct the prior of node factor loadings with the sum of attribute factor loadings.,4. Related work,[0],[0]
Our model has several advantages over SSI-PF: (1) The derivation of Gibbs sampling of SSI-PF requires that each column of Θ is normalised (Eq. (18)).,4. Related work,[0],[0]
This limits the application of SSI-PF to other models such as EPM which is an unnormalised model.,4. Related work,[0],[0]

"(3) Shown
in Section 5, our model is more effective especially when a node has multiple attributes.

"There are also models that extend PF and collective matrix factorisation (Singh & Gordon, 2008) to jointly factorise relational networks and document-word matrices such as (Gopalan et al., 2014a; Zhang & Wang, 2015; Acharya et al., 2015).",4. Related work,[0],[0]

"While current algorithms for subspace clustering are unsupervised, in many cases a human could provide relevant information in the form of pairwise constraints between points, e.g., answering whether two images are of the same person or whether two objects are the same.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The incorporation of pairwise constraints into clustering algorithms is known as pairwise-constrained clustering (PCC).,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
PCC algorithms use supervision in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints by ensuring that points with must-link constraints are clustered together and points with cannot-link constraints are clustered apart.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In (Davidson et al., 2006), the authors investigate the phenomenon that incorporating poorly-chosen constraints can lead to an increase in clustering error, rather than a decrease as one would expect from additional label information.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This is because points constrained to be in the same cluster that are otherwise dissimilar can confound the constrained clustering algorithm.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For this reason, researchers have turned to active query selection methods, in which constraints are intelligently selected based on a number of heuristics.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
These algorithms perform well across a number of datasets but do not take advantage of any known structure in the data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"An example union of subspaces is shown in Fig. 1, where d1 = 2, d2 = d3 = 1.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The goal of subspace clustering algorithms has traditionally been to cluster the points in X according to their nearest subspace without any supervised input.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We turn this around and ask whether this model is useful for active clustering, where we request a very small number of intelligently selected labels.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A key observation when considering data well-modeled by a union of subspaces is that uncertain points will be ones lying equally distant to multiple subspaces.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Using a novel definition of margin tailored for the union of subspaces model, we incorporate this observation into an active subspace clustering
algorithm.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our contributions are as follows.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We introduce a novel algorithm for pairwise constrained clustering that leverages UoS structure in the data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A key step in our algorithm is choosing points of minimum margin, i.e., those lying near a decision boundary between subspaces.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We define a notion of margin for the UoS model and provide theoretical insight as to why points of minimum margin are likely to be misclustered by unsupervised algorithms.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show through extensive experimental results that when the data lie near a union of subspaces, our method drastically outperforms existing PCC algorithms, requiring far fewer queries to achieve perfect clustering.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our datasets range in dimension from 256-2016, number of data points from 320-9298, and number of subspaces from 5-100.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"On ten MNIST digits with a modest number of queries, we get 5% classification error with only 500 pairwise queries compared to about 20% error for current state-of-the-art PCC algorithms and 35% for unsupervised algorithms.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We also achieve 0% classification error on the full Yale, COIL, and USPS datasets with a small fraction of the number of queries needed by competing algorithms.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In datasets where we do not expect subspace structure, our algorithm still achieves competitive performance.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Further, our algorithm is agnostic to the input subspace clustering algorithm and can therefore take advantage of any future algorithmic advances for subspace clustering.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A survey of recently developed subspace clustering algorithms can be found in (Vidal, 2011) and the textbook (Vidal et al., 2016).",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In these and more recent work, clustering algorithms that employ spectral methods achieve the best performance on most datasets.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Notable examples of such algorithms include Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) (Elhamifar & Vidal, 2013) and its extensions (You et al., 2016b;a), Low-Rank Representation (LRR) (Liu et al., 2010), Thresholded Subspace Clustering (TSC) (Heckel & Bölcskei, 2015), and Greedy Subspace Clustering (GSC)
(Park et al., 2014).",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Many recent algorithms exist with both strong theoretical guarantees and empirical performance, and a full review of all approaches is beyond the scope of this work.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, the core element of all recent algorithms lies in the formation of the affinity matrix, after which spectral clustering is performed to obtain label estimates.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In SSC, the affinity matrix is formed via a series of `1-penalized regressions.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
LRR uses a similar cost function but penalizes the nuclear norm instead of the `1.,2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"TSC thresholds the spherical distance between points, and GSC works by successively (greedily) building subspaces from points likely to lie in the same subspace.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Of these methods, variants of SSC achieve the best overall performance on benchmark datasets and has the strongest theoretical guarantees, which were introduced in (Elhamifar & Vidal, 2013) and strengthened in numerous recent works (Soltanolkotabi & Candes, 2012; 2014; Wang & Xu, 2013; Wang et al., 2016).",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"While the development of efficient algorithms with stronger guarantees has received a great deal of attention, very little attention has been paid to the question of what to do about data that cannot be correctly clustered.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Thus, when reducing clustering error to zero (or near zero) is a priority, users must look beyond unsupervised subspace clustering algorithms to alternative methods.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"One such method is to request some supervised input in the form of pairwise constraints, leading to the study of pairwise-constrained clustering (PCC).
",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"PCC algorithms work by incorporating must-link and cannot-link constraints between points, where points with must-link constraints are forced (or encouraged in the case of spectral clustering) to be clustered together, and points with cannot-link constraints are forced to be in separate clusters.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In many cases, these constraints can be provided by a human labeler.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, in (Biswas & Jacobs, 2014), the authors perform experiments where comparisons between human faces are provided by users of Amazon Mechanical Turk with an error rate of 1.2%.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Similarly, for subspace clustering datasets such as Yale B and MNIST, a human could easily answer questions such as, “Are these two faces the same person?” and “Are these two images the same number?”",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"An early example of PCC is found in (Wagstaff et al., 2001), where the authors modify the K-means cost function to incorporate such constraints.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"In (Basu et al., 2004), the authors utilize active methods to initialize K-means in an intelligent “EXPLORE” phase, during which neighborhoods of must-linked points are built up.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"After this phase, new points are queried against representatives from each neighborhood until a must-link is obtained.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"A similar explore phase is used in (Mallapragada et al., 2008), after which a min-max approach is used to select the most uncertain sample.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Early work on constrained spectral clustering appears in (Xu et al., 2005; Wang & Davidson, 2010), in which spectral clustering is improved by examining the
eigenvectors of the affinity matrix in order to determine the most informative points.",2. Related Work,[0],[0]

This is due to the previously mentioned fact that imputing the wrong constraints can lead to worse clustering performance.,4. Experimental Results,[0],[0]

"In the case of COIL-20, the clustering is sometimes unstable, alternating between roughly 0% and 7% clustering error for both active algorithms.",4. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
This further demonstrates the observed phenomenon that spectral clustering is sensitive to small perturbations.,4. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"To avoid this issue, we kept track of the K-subspaces cost function (see (Bradley & Mangasarian, 2000)) and ensured the cost decreased at every iteration.",4. Experimental Results,[0],[0]

"Note that N is large for this dataset, making spectral clustering computationally burdensome.",4. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"Further, the computational complexity of URASC is dependent on N .",4. Experimental Results,[0],[0]
"As a result, URASC did not complete 2000 queries in 48 hours of run time when using 10 cores, so we compare to the result after completing only 1000 queries.",4. Experimental Results,[0],[0]

We continue the study of algorithms for `p norms on streaming and distributed data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A particular novelty of our results is that unlike previous distributed and streaming algorithms, they can all be implemented deterministically, i.e., our algorithms make no random choices.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While in a number of settings randomized algorithms are highly beneficial, leading to massive computational savings, there are other applications which require extremely high reliability, for which one needs to obtain guaranteed performance across a large number of inputs.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"If one were to use a randomized algorithm, then it would need vanishingly small error probability; however, many celebrated algorithms in numerical linear algebra succeed with only constant probability.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Another limitation of randomized algorithms was shown in (Hardt & Woodruff, 2013): if the input to a randomized sketch depends on the output of a preceding algorithm using the same sketch, then the randomized sketch can give an arbitrarily bad answer.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Hence, such methods cannot handle adaptively chosen inputs.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, while randomized algorithms certainly have their place, the issues of high reliability and adaptivity motivate the development of deterministic methods for a number of other settings, for which algorithms are scarce.

Our main application is to show how high dimensional regression and low rank approximation problems can be solved approximately and deterministically in the sketch and solve paradigm.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The core of the summary is to find rows of the original matrix which have high leverage scores.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"That is, they contain a lot of information about the shape of the data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the Euclidean norm, leverage scores correspond directly to row norms of an orthonormal basis.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is less straightforward for other `p norms, where the scores correspond to the row norms of so-called `p-well-conditioned bases.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, while leverage scores are often used for sampling in randomized algorithms, we use them here in the context of fully deterministic algorithms.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show how a superset of rows with high leverage scores can be found for arbitrary `p norms, based on only local information.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This leads to efficient algorithms which identify rows with high (local) leverage scores within subsets of the data, and proceed hierarchically to collect a sufficient set of rows.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"These rows then allow us to solve regression problems: essentially, we solve the regression problem corresponding to just the retained input rows.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We apply this technique to `p-regression and entrywise `p-low rank approximation.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In particular, we use it to solve the `∞-regression problem with additive error in a stream.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Note that the `∞ problem reduces to finding a ball of minimum radius which covers the data, and global solutions are slow due to the need to solve a linear program.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead, we show that only a subset of the data needs to be retained in the streaming model to compute accurate approximations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given the relationship between the streaming model and the distributed model that we later define, this could be seen in the context of having data stored over multiple machines who could send ‘important’ rows of their data to a central coordinator in order to compute the approximation.

Section 3 presents an algorithm which returns rows of high ‘importance’ in a data matrix with additive error.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This follows by storing a polynomial number (in d) of rows and using these to compute a well-conditioned basis.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

A key technical insight to proving Theorem 3.3 below is that rows of high leverage globally can be found by repeatedly finding rows of local high leverage.,3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]
"While relative `p row norms of a submatrix are at least as large as the full relative `p norms, it is not guaranteed that this property holds for leverage scores.",3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]

"The proof relies heavily on properties of the well-conditioned basis and details are given in the Supplementary Material, Lemma A.1.",3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]
"This lemma shows that local leverage scores can potentially drop in arbitrary `p norm, contrasting the behavior in `2.",3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]
"However, it is possible to find all rows exceeding a threshold globally by altering the local threshold.",3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]
"That is, to find all wi > τ",3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]
globally we can find all local leverage scores exceeding an adjusted threshold ŵi > τ/poly(d) to obtain a superset of all rows which exceed the global threshold.,3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]
"The price to pay for this is a poly(d) increase in space cost which, importantly, remains sublinear in n.",3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]

Any i for which the local leverage exceeds the adjusted threshold is kept in the sample and all other rows are deleted.,3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]

Two operations are needed for this model of computation: the merge and reduce steps.,3. Finding Rows of High Leverage,[0],[0]

Both of these theorems require that p is constant and not equal to the ∞-norm.,6. Application: `∞-Regression,[0],[0]

Methods.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
We analyze two instantiations of our methods based on how we find a well-conditioned basis and repeat over 5 independent trials with random permutations of the data.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The methods are as follows:
SPC3: We use an algorithm of Yang et al. (2013) to compute an `1-wcb.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This method is randomized as it employs the Sparse Cauchy Transform and is only an `1-wellconditioned basis with constant probability We also implemented a check condition which showed that almost always, roughly 99% of the time, the randomized construction SPC3 would return a (d2.5, 1, 1)-well-conditioned basis.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Thus, we bypassed this check in our experiment to ensure quick update times.
",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Orth:,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In addition, we also used an orthonormal basis using the QR decomposition which is an `2-wcb.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This method is fully deterministic and outputs a ( √ d, 1, 2)-well- conditioned basis.
",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Sample: A sample of the data is chosen uniformly at random and the retained summary has size exactly m.
Identity: No conditioning is performed.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For a block B of the input, the surrogate scores wi(B) =",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
‖eTi B‖22/‖B‖2F are used to determine which rows to keep.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As the sum of these wi(B) is 1, we keep all rows which have wi(B) > 2/m. Since no more than m/2 of the rows can satisfy wi(B)",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"> 2/m, the size of the stored subset of rows can be controlled and cannot grow too large.
",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Remark 7.1.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
The Identity method keeps only the rows with high norm which contrasts our conditioning approach: if most of the mass of the block is concentrated on a few rows then these will appear heavy locally despite the possibility that they may correspond to previously seen or unimportant directions.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In particular, if these heavy rows significantly outweigh the weight of some sparse directions in the data it is likely that the sparse directions will not be found at all.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For instance, consider data X ∈ Rn×d which is then augmented by appending the identity (and zeros) so that these are the only vectors in the new directions.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"That is, set X ′ =",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"[X,0n×k;0k×d, Ik×k] and then
permute the rows of X ′. The appended sparse vectors from Ik×k will have leverage of 1 so will be detected by the wellconditioned basis methods.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
However there is no guarantee that the Identity method will identify these directions if the entries in X significantly outweigh those in Ik×k.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In addition, there is also no guarantee that using uniform sampling will identify these points, particularly when k is small compared to n and d.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"So while choosing to do no conditioning seems attractive, this example shows that doing so may not give any meaningful guarantees and hence we prefer the approach in Section 3.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We compare only to these baselines as we are not aware of any other competing methods in the small memory regime for the `∞-regression problem.
Datasets.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We tested the methods on a subset of the US Census Data containing 5 million rows and 11 columns2 and YearPredictionMSD3 which has roughly 500,000 rows and 90 columns (although we focus on a fixed 50,000 row sample so that the LP for regression is tractable: see Figure 4c in the Supplementary Material, Appendix F).",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For the census dataset, space constraints between 50,000 and 500,000 rows were tested and for the YearPredictionsMSD data space budgets were tested between 2,500 and 25,000.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The general behavior is roughly the same for both datasets so for brevity we primarily show the results for US Census Data, and defer corresponding plots for YearPredictionsMSD to Appendix F.
Results on approximation error compared to storage Let f∗ denote the minimal value of the full regression obtained by x∗ and let x′ be the output of the reduced problem.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
The approximate solution to the full problem is then f̂ = ‖Ax′,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
− b‖∞ and approximation error is measured as f̂/f∗ − 1 (note that f̂ ≥ f∗).,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
An error closer to 0 demonstrates that f̂ is roughly the same as f∗ so the optimal value is well-approximated.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Figures 2a and 2b show that on both datasets the Identity method consistently performs poorly while Sample achieves comparable accuracy to the conditioning methods.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Despite the simplicity of uniform sampling to keep a summary, the succeeding sections discuss the increased time and space costs of using such a sample and show that doing so is not favourable.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Thus, neither of the baseline methods output a summary which can be used to approximate the regression problem both accurately and quickly, hence justifying our use of leverage scores.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Our conditioning methods perform particularly well in the US Census Data data (Figure 2a) with Orth appearing to give the most accurate summary and SPC3 performing comparably well but with slightly more fluctuation: similar behaviour is observed in the YearPredictionMSD

(Figure 2b) data too.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The conditioning methods are also seen to be robust to the storage constraint, give accurate performance across both datasets using significantly less storage than sampling, and give a better estimate in general than doing no conditioning.
",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Results on Space Complexity.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Recall that the space constraint is m rows and throughout the stream, after a local computation, the merge step concatenates more rows to the existing summary until the bound m is met, prior to computing the next reduction.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"During the initialization of the block A′ by Algorithm 1, the number of stored rows is exactly m.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, we measure the maximum number of rows kept in a summary after every reduction step to understand how large the returned summary can grow.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As seen in Figure 2c, Identity keeps the smallest summary but there is no reason to expect it has kept the most important rows.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In contrast, if m is the bound on the summary size, then uniform sampling always returns a summary of size exactly m. However, we see that this is not optimal as both conditioning methods can return a set of rows which are pruned at every iteration to roughly half the size and contains only the most important rows in that block.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Both conditioning methods exhibit similar behavior and are bounded between both Sample and Identity methods.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Therefore, both of the conditioning methods respect the theoretical bound and, crucially, return a summary which is sublinear in the space constraint and hence a significantly smaller fraction of the input size.
Results on Time Complexity.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
There are three time costs measured.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
The first is the update time taken to compute the local well-conditioned basis which is theoretically O(md2 +md5 logm) by Theorem 2.2.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, the two bases that we test are an orthonormal basis, computable in time O(md2) and the SPC3 transform which takes time O(nnz(B) logm) for a block B with m rows and nnz(B) non-zero entries.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Figure 3a demonstrates that SPC3 is faster than Orth on this data in practice but this small absolute difference becomes negligible over the entirety of the stream as seen in Figure 3c.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
The query time in Figure 3b is roughly proportional to the summary size in all instances but here the conditioning methods perform noticeably better due to the smaller summary size that is returned as discussed in the previous section.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, as seen in Figure 4c, (Supplementary Material, Appendix F ) this disparity becomes hugely significant on higher dimensionality data due to the increased size summary retained by sampling, further justifying our approach of pruning rows at every stage.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"While Identity appears to have fast query time, this is due to the summary being smaller.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Although it may seem that for smaller summaries more local bases need to be computed and this time could prohibitively increase over the stream, Figure 3c demonstrates that even using small blocks does not cause the overall time (to process the stream and pro-
duce an approximate query) to increase too much.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Hence, an approximation can be obtained which is highly accurate, and in total time faster than the brute force solver.
",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Experimental Summary.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"While it might seem attractive not to perform any conditioning on the matrix and just pick heavy rows, our experiments show that this strategy is not effective in practice, and delivers poor accuracy.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Although a simple sample of randomly chosen rows can be easily maintained, this appears less useful due to the increased time costs associated with larger summaries when conditioning methods output a similar estimate in less time over the entire stream.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
As the `∞-regression problems depend only on a few rows of the data there are cases when uniform sampling can perform well: if many of the critical rows look similar then there is a chance that uniform sampling will select some examples.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In this case, the leverage of the important direction is divided across the repetitions, and so it is harder to ensure that desired direction is identified.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Despite this potential drawback we have shown that both Orth and SPC3 can be used to find accurate summaries which perform robustly across each of the measures we have tested.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"It appears that SPC3 performs comparably
to Orth; both are relatively quick to compute and admit accurate summaries in similar space.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In particular, both conditioning methods return summaries which are a fraction of the space budget and hence highly sublinear in the input size, which give accurate approximations and are robust to the concatenation of new rows.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"All of these factors make the conditioning method fast in practice to both find the important rows in the data and then compute the reduced regression problem with high accuracy.
",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Due to the problems in constructing summaries which can be used to solve regression quickly and accurately when using random sampling or no transformation, our methods are shown to be efficient and accurate alternatives.",7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Our approach is vindicated both theoretically and practically: this is most clear in the U.S. Census dataset where small error can be achieved using a summary roughly 2% the size of the data.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
This also results in an overall speedup as solving the optimization on the reduced set is much faster than solving on the full problem.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]
Such significant savings show that this general approach can be useful in large-scale applications.,7. Experimental Evaluation,[0],[0]

"Much attention has recently been paid to non-task-oriented dialogue systems —or chatoriented dialogue systems— both in research (Higashinaka et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2016) and in industry.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to pure chat-oriented systems, some task-oriented dialogue systems can engage in chat-oriented dialogues (Lee et al., 2009; Dingli and Scerri, 2013; Kobori et al., 2016; Papaioannou and Lemon, 2017) because such dialogues are expected to build rapport (Bickmore and Picard, 2005) between users and systems.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For simplicity, we will call any system that can engage in chat-oriented dialogue a chat-
bot.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since an open-domain chatbot that always generates appropriate utterances is still difficult to build (Higashinaka et al., 2015), we think it is worth building a closed-domain chatbot, which tries to continue dialogues in a specific domain.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One problem in building closed-domain chatbots is that, although they should preferably have comprehensive lexical knowledge in their domains, all the knowledge cannot realistically be prepared in advance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we must consider the case where a user uses terms outside of the system’s vocabulary1, i.e. terms that have ontological categories the system does not know.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"If the system can acquire the term’s category during dialogues, it will be able to interact with users more naturally and the cost of expanding its knowledge base will be reduced.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We call the problem of acquiring the category of an unknown term lexical acquisition.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"If the system can predict the category of an unknown term, it can ask the user if it is correct (Otsuka et al., 2013; Komatani et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, repeating such explicit confirmation requests can degrade the user experience in chat-oriented dialogues2.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We therefore need to find a way to enable chatbots to: (1) interact with the user naturally and (2) acquire lexical information.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To solve this dilemma, we proposed an approach using implicit confirmation (Ono et al., 2016), where the system makes a confirmation request about the predicted category and uses the user’s response to decide if the category is correct or not.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, whether such an approach is really possible or not has not been well studied.

plicit confirmation dialogues from multiple users to increase the accuracy for determining if the predicted category is correct or not3.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The system estimates the confidence score that the category prediction is correct from the responses of multiple users to the same implicit confirmation requests (Figure 1: right).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our proposed method has the goal of improving the confidence score estimation by using implicit confirmation sub-dialogues with multiple users.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Then the system can determine if it should add the lexical information to the system’s knowledge.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For a sub-task, we consider the problem of estimating how likely the predicted category is to be correct from implicit confirmation sub-dialogues with one user (Figure 1: left).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It is reasonable to assume that the system can make confirmation requests about the same unknown term with different users because chatbots typically run on servers so they can share interaction logs for different users.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, it is difficult to ask a single user to respond to confirmation requests with the same predicted category many times, so collecting responses from multiple users is desirable.

"So far, several studies have addressed lexical acquisition in dialogues.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
Meng et al. (2004) and Takahashi et al. (2002) proposed methods for predicting the categories of unknown terms.,3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"They acquire coarse categories for unknown terms, which roughly correspond to named entity categories.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
Those categories can be acquired more easily than the more specific categories that we are trying to acquire.,3 Related Work,[0],[0]
Holzapfel et al. (2008) proposed a method for a robot to acquire fine-grained categories for unknown terms by iteratively asking questions.,3 Related Work,[0],[0]
We do not think this method is suitable for chatbots as it repeats explicit questions.,3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Whereas a previous study tried to acquire relationships among domain-dependent entities in dialogues (Pappu and Rudnicky, 2014), here we focus on acquiring lexical information, which is required before such relations are obtained.
",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
We address the problem of deciding if the content of an implicit confirmation request is correct or not.,3 Related Work,[0],[0]
Some studies related to this problem have tried to classify affirmative and negative sentences by using rules or statistical methods.,3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, de Marneffe et al. (2009) built rules for judging if a response to a yes/no question is affirmative or negative when it is not a simple “yes” or “no.” Gokcen and de Marneffe (2015)",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
investigated features for detecting disagreement in the corpus of arguments on the Web.,3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, in this paper, we do not try to classify user responses into affirmative and negative ones but try to determine whether a category in an implicit confirmation request is correct or not.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we utilize multiple sub-dialogues with different users.
",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our method can be considered as an instance of implicitly supervised learning (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2007; Komatani and Rudnicky, 2009) in that user responses to implicit confirmation requests are used as indicators for acquisition, though the target knowledge is different from those works.",3 Related Work,[0],[0]
The purpose of our method is to prevent the system from learning incorrect categories for an unknown term by using multiple implicit confirmation subdialogues with different users.,4 Determining Correct Categories Using Responses from Multiple Users,[0],[0]
This is possible because our system is designed as a server-based dialogue system and can give implicit confirmation requests with the same predicted category to different users.,4 Determining Correct Categories Using Responses from Multiple Users,[0],[0]
"The proposed method determines more accurately whether or not the predicted category in the implicit confirmation request is correct by exploiting multiple responses to them.

The index i denotes the i-th response to implicit confirmation requests.,4 Determining Correct Categories Using Responses from Multiple Users,[0],[0]
"Our goal here is to obtain a confidence score Conf (w , c) representing how likely category c of the unknown term w is to be correct on the basis of replies to implicit confirmation requests from n different users.",4 Determining Correct Categories Using Responses from Multiple Users,[0],[0]

n increases, we design features that consist of a constant number even when n varies and that are derived from n responses to implicit confirmation requests with category c.",4.2 Obtaining Confidence Scores for Correct Categories,[0],[0]
We conducted experiments to verify if our method is effective.,5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"Although it would have been desirable to collect experimental data by incorporating our method into the chatbot we are developing and having it used by many people without giving any instructions, this would have required a huge amount of interactions to collect enough data to verify our method.",5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
We therefore collected user responses to implicit confirmation requests from 100 workers via crowdsourcing5.,5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"The data collection procedure consists of three steps: (1) a worker inputs an utterance containing a term specified on the interface at the crowdsourcing site, (2) the system generates an implicit confirmation request about the term, and (3) the worker fills in the response to the confirmation request.",5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"This procedure was repeated for 20 specified terms per worker.

The worker was able to check the Wikipedia page for the specified term by following a link on the GUI.,5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"This was to prevent them from talking without understanding the term.
",5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
We prepared 20 terms and their corresponding implicit confirmation requests used at Step (2): 10 had correct categories and the other 10 had incorrect categories.,5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"For example, for “shurasuko” (the Japanese rendering of churrasco), an implicit confirmation request with its correct category “meat dish6” is “Eating meat is fun, isn’t it?”",5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, for “sangria,” an implicit confirmation request with an incorrect category “yogashi7” is “Yogashi have a rich taste, don’t they?”",5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, expressions of the implicit confirmation request were altered to make the confirmation request more natural when a worker’s input was interrogative or negative.
",5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
"We obtained 1,956 responses from 98 workers, half of which were responses to implicit confirmation requests with correct categories, and the other half were responses to those with incorrect ones.",5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
We removed data from two workers who just input only specified words or repeated the same sentences.,5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]
We also removed four invalid inputs consisting of only spaces.,5 Data Collection via Crowdsourcing,[0],[0]

"Here, U1，S1，and U2 respectively denote a user input, the implicit confirmation request by the system after U1, and the user response to the request.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"All feature values are binary; if the sentence for a feature is true, its value is 1, otherwise it is 0.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"These features were designed to represent differences in expressions of user responses to implicit confirmation requests with either a correct or incorrect category.
",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
We briefly explain some important features by using the examples below.,6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
A user often uses affirmative expressions when responding to an implicit confirmation request with a correct category.,6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"This is represented by Feature g1, for which 15 affirmative expressions in Japanese were used such as “Yes” and “That’s right.”
",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"When a category in an implicit confirmation request is correct, a user tends to continue with the same topic in U2 as in U1.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"In the example in Figure 3 (a), the user continues with the same topic and uses the same term tempura soba in U1 and U2.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"This is represented by Feature g4.
",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"When the system makes an implicit confirmation request on the basis of an incorrect category, users tend to feel the system has suddenly changed the topic.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"In this case, the user tries to return the topic in U2 to the original one in U1.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"An example is as follows.
U1: I like sangria with its fruity taste.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
S1:,6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"Yogashi have a rich taste, don’t they?",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"U2: I am talking about the alcoholic bev-
erage.
",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"In this example, the system generates an implicit confirmation with the incorrect category “yogashi” in S1 although the correct category of sangria is “alcoholic beverage.”",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
Then the user says that the topic is an alcoholic beverage and tries to return to the original topic.,6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"Here, another category name not used in S1 is included in U2.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"This is represented as Feature g6.
",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"For Feature g2, 17 negative expressions were used such as “is not [category name used in S1]” and “No.”",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"For Feature g3, six expressions such as “It is [category name not used in S1]” that tries to correct the system’s previous confirmation request were used.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"Our system has 20 categories, and five more names such as “cheese” and “pasta” were used as category names for Features g6 and g9.",6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
Eighteen expressions including interrogatives were used for Feature g10.,6.1 Features for Obtaining Probabilities with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
We conducted a preliminary experiment to classify responses to implicit confirmation requests with correct and incorrect categories.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"The data consists of the 1,956 responses and their contexts obtained by crowdsourcing as described in Section 5.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
We applied logistic regression to them with the features listed in Table 2.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"We used the module in Weka (version 3.8.1) (Hall et al., 2009) as its implementation.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
The parameters were the default values.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"The classification was performed by setting a threshold to the obtained probability pi(w, c).",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"The threshold was 0.5, which is also the default value of Weka.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"Evaluation was conducted with a 10-fold cross validation.
",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
We compared two feature sets: one consists of all 11 features listed in Table 2 and the other consists of Features g1 and g2 only.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"The latter corresponds to a baseline condition that only considers affirmative and negative expressions of U2 and does not consider any relationship with S1 and U1.
",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows confusion matrices of the raw outputs for the two feature sets.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
Table 4 summarizes the results as precision and recall rates and F-measures of the two categories (correct and incorrect) also for the two feature sets.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"The average-F scores, i.e. the arithmetic means of F-measures for the two categories, were 0.719 and 0.528 when all features and only g1 and g2 were used, respectively.
",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"This indicates that using the features representing context improves the classification more than using only the features obtained from U2.
",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
We also performed feature selection to analyze which features were effective for the classification.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"More specifically, we performed the same experiments with all combinations of the 11 features, i.e., 2047(= 211 − 1) feature sets, and calculated their average-F scores.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
Table 5 lists top-10 feature sets sorted by the scores.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
“None” denotes the case when all the 11 features were used.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"First, the “None” condition was ranked second in the table, which shows that almost all features were effective for the classification.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"Next, when Feature g10 was removed, the F-value for the Incorrect category slightly improved and thus the average-F score also improved, as shown in the table.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"Because Feature g10 also appears in the table several times, Feature g10 was implied to be less helpful in this classification.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the weight value for Feature g8 of the logistic regression function had the largest and positive value when Feature g10 was removed.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"This shows Feature g8 gave strong evidence and resulting pi(w, c) tended to be higher when Feature g8 was 1.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"This means that, when the common category name is included both in U1 and S1, the category included in S1 tended to be correct because the topic is not changed abruptly.
",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
The results shown above indicate the classification performance was about 70% precision and recall rates on the basis of the user response and its context.,6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"However, we need higher precision because pairs of an unknown term and its predicted category will be added to the system knowledge, which must not contain errors.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"Thus, we have proposed a method using multiple user responses as described in Section 4, the effectiveness of which
is verified in the following section.",6.2 Classification Performance with Single User Responses,[0],[0]
"In this section, we explain how to prepare data for training and evaluating the regression function to obtain Conf (w , c).",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
We performed the experiment in a perfectly open manner: no data were shared in training and test phases from the viewpoint of either workers or questions.,7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"More specifically, we had 98 (or 97) responses to implicit confirmation requests with 10 correct and 10 incorrect categories for making implicit confirmation requests, as explained in Section 5.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"Thus, we divided them into four disjointed groups, i.e., one group consists of 49 (or 48) workers with five correct and five incorrect categories.
",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
The data were generated using responses collected from multiple users.,7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"The responses are mutually independent because they are obtained by a server-based dialogue system, so they can be combined in an arbitrary order.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"Thus, when we have N responses to single implicit confirmation requests, we can generate ( N n ) patterns.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"In our experiment, N was 49 (or 48) in each group.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"Since the values of ( N n ) become very large, we set a cut-off value when generating the combination randomly.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"The value was set to 1, 000 when ( N n ) exceeds 1, 000.
",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"From this data combination, we obtained feature values listed in Table 1 with the reference values for every case.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"The reference value was set to either 1 or 0 depending on whether the category used in the implicit confirmation request was correct or not, respectively.
",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
We then trained the regression function with each set of divided data of the four groups.,7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"We selected test data sets to be completely disjointed
from each of the four data sets from the viewpoint of both workers and questions.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
"We also used the logistic regression, which was implemented in Weka (version 3.8.1) (Hall et al., 2009), with its default parameters.",7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
The results by the regression for the four test sets are used together and analyzed hereafter.,7.1 Data Preparation,[0],[0]
We first investigated if the performance was better when the system used multiple responses from users.,7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
"The precision and recall rates were calculated by setting various thresholds to Conf (w , c) representing how likely a category c is to be correct for an unknown term w.
Figure 7 depicts the precision and recall curves for n up to 8.",7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
"It also shows a line indicating the breakeven points (BEPs), meaning the value where the two rates are equal.",7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
The BEP is used as a single point representing a precision and recall curve and to show how good the estimated confidence score is when n changes.,7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
"Note that n = 1 corresponds to the case when only single responses were used for the regression.
",7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
The performance represented by the BEP values became better as n became larger.,7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
"In particular, the BEP values of n ≥ 2 were larger than that of n = 1.",7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
"This proves that the proposed method using multiple user responses more accurately determines whether the predicted category is correct or not.
",7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
We also performed feature selection by removing arbitrary features listed in Table 1.,7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
"The performance of the regression function was measured by the summation of BEP values for each n (1 ≤
n ≤ 48).",7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
The result revealed the best performance in the case was obtained when we used only Features f3 and f4.,7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
One reason for this result was that the correlations among the features might be high.,7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
"We still need to further investigate feature sets to obtain better Conf(w, c), which is future work.",7.2 Performance of Regression with Multiple Responses,[0],[0]
We discuss the relationship between the values of n and the performance of the regression function in more detail.,7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
Figure 7 shows that the performance represented by the BEP improved when n increased.,7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, cost will need to be incurred for increasing n, i.e., collecting responses from more human users.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"Thus, we investigate how much the performance of the regression function changed when n increased.
",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
We first investigated how the BEP values increased in accordance with n values.,7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
Figure 8 depicts the increases in the BEP values when n was incremented by 1.,7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
It shows the increases were large while n ≤ 5.,7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"This result indicates that it is worthwhile to ask more users implicit confirmation requests with predicted category c especially while n is small, to more accurately determine whether or not the category is correct.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"The figure also shows that the improvement mostly diminished, especially when n ≥ 10.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"This indicates that the effect by asking implicit confirmation requests to more human users shows diminishing returns as n increases from the viewpoint of the performance represented by the BEP.
",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"We furthermore investigated recall rates when thresholds were set to Conf (w , c) so as to keep precision rates high.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"In our problem setting, high precision rates rather than high recall rates are re-
quired to avoid incorrect information being mistakenly added to the system knowledge.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"Figure 7 also shows the precision rate approached 1 for n ≥ 5 by setting very large thresholds to Conf (w , c).",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
These cases indicate that the system can be almost perfectly confident that the predicted category c is correct.,7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
The recall rates were low for such cases because the precision and recall rates are in a trade-off relationship.,7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"We investigated the recall rates for such cases when n increased.
",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"Figure 9 depicts the recall rates when we set very high threshold values for Conf (w , c) so that the precision rates become almost one, i.e., 1 − ϵ. Here, we set ϵ = 0.0058.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"First, the graph shows that the precision rate existed when n was 5 or more.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"For example, the recall rate for n = 5 was 0.175.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
"This recall rate was rather low, but we think high precision rates should be prioritized over recall rates, even if some correct information is discarded at the current n. Second, the graph also shows that the recall rates increased with n. This means that, if the system asks more implicit confirmation requests with category c, more unknown terms the categories of which are c will be acquired with a sufficiently high precision rate.",7.3 Discussion on Reasonable Number of Responses,[0],[0]
We have proposed a method to determine if the ontological category of an unknown term included in an implicit confirmation request is correct or not.,8 Concluding Remarks,[0],[0]
"Although responses to implicit confirmation requests seem to be insufficient for determining this, our method makes it effective by using the information on the context of the responses and exploiting responses from multiple users.",8 Concluding Remarks,[0],[0]

imental results revealed that the proposed method exhibited higher performance than when only single user responses were used.,8 Concluding Remarks,[0],[0]

"The proposed method is expected to enable a chatbot to acquire knowledge through dialogues without annoying users with repetitive simple explicit confirmation requests, while it can avoid acquiring wrong knowledge by achieving a high precision rate for determining the correctness of the knowledge.

We are planning to address several issues before deploying this method in a chatbot.,8 Concluding Remarks,[0],[0]
"Although we intuitively think implicit confirmation requests do not degrade users’ impressions compared with repetitive explicit confirmation requests, we need to experimentally verify this by a user study.",8 Concluding Remarks,[0],[0]
"On the basis of its results, we will define a strategy of when to make implicit confirmation requests and when to make explicit confirmation requests.",8 Concluding Remarks,[0],[0]
"Despite these remaining issues, we believe that the experimental results presented in this paper are valuable in that they show the possibility of lexical acquisition through implicit confirmation.",8 Concluding Remarks,[0],[0]

"Lexical knowledge about the likely order of events is therefore necessary for any semantic task that requires temporal reasoning or planning, such as classifying temporal relations (Mani et al., 2006; Lapata and Lascarides, 2006; Yoshikawa et al., 2009; D’Souza and Ng, 2013; Mirza and Tonelli, 2014, inter alia), textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2013) or temporal information extraction (Ling and Weld, 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Concretely, the task is to predict the order of an unordered set of predicate-argument structures.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Predicting the likely order of event types is a step towards more intricate planning and reasoning scenarios (see §3), and is useful in itself for tasks such as conceptto-text generation (Reiter et al., 2000), or in validating the correctness of instruction sets.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A related idea can be found in modeling sentence coherence (Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008, inter alia), although here we focus on lexical relations between events, rather than coherence relations between complete sentences.

"However, despite their appeal, these methods have mostly fo-

"In summary, the contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) we explore the task of lexical event ordering and means for its evaluation; (2) we present an edge-factored model for the task, and show it can be used to predict the order of events well (77.7% according to standard measures for ordering evaluation); (3) we present a method for extracting events and create a dataset of ordered events using recipes extracted from the web.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Temporal semantics is receiving increasing attention in recent years.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Lexical features are in frequent use and rely in most part on external resources which are either manually compiled or automatically induced.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The line of work most closely related to ours focuses on inducing lexical relations between

"Most work has been unsupervised, often using pattern-based approaches relying on manually crafted (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) or induced patterns (Davidov et al., 2007), that correlate with temporal relations (e.g., temporal discourse connectives).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Talukdar et al. (2012) uses the textual order of events in Wikipedia biographical articles to induce lexical information.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We use both textual order and discourse connectives to define our feature set, and explore a setting which allows for the straightforward incorporation of additional features.
Chambers and Jurafsky (2008b; 2009) addressed the unsupervised induction of partially ordered event chains (or schema) in the news domain, centered around a common protagonist.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"One of their evaluation scenarios tackles a binary classification related to event ordering, and seeks to distinguish ordered sets of events from randomly permuted ones, yielding an accuracy of 75%.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Manshadi et al. (2008) used language models to learn event sequences and conducted a similar evaluation on weblogs with about 65% accuracy.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The classification task we explore here is considerably more complex (see §8).

The task of script knowledge induction has been frequently addressed in recent years.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Balasubramanian et al. (2013) and Pichotta and Mooney (2014) extended Chambers and Jurafsky’s model to include events that have multiple arguments.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Jans et al. (2012) use skip-grams to capture event-event relations between not necessarily consecutive events.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Regneri et al. (2010) constructed a temporal lexical knowledge base through crowd-sourcing.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Their approach is appealing as it greatly reduces the costs incurred by manual annotation and can potentially be used in conjunction with lexical information obtained from raw text.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Modi and Titov (2014) jointly learns the stereotypical order of events and their distributional representation, in order to capture paraphrased instances of the same event type.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Frermann et al. (2014) models the joint task of inducing event paraphrases and their order using a Bayesian framework.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"All latter three works evaluated their induced temporal ordering knowledge on a binary prediction of whether a temporal relation between a pair of (not necessarily related) events holds, and not on the prediction of a complete permutation given an unordered event set as in this work.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their evaluation was conducted on 30 event pairs manually an-
notated through crowd-sourcing, where Modi and Titov (2014) further included an evaluation on a large set of pairs automatically extracted from the Gigaword corpus.

"The appeal of the cooking domain for studying various semantic phenomena has been recognized by several studies in NLP and AI (Tasse and Smith, 2008; Bollini et al., 2013; Cimiano et al., 2013; Regneri et al., 2013; Malmaud et al., 2014).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The domain is here motivated by several considerations.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"First, recipes mostly describe concrete actions, rather than abstract relations, which are less relevant to temporal ordering.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Second, from a practical point of view, many recipes are available online in computerreadable format.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Third, the restrictiveness of the cooking domain can also be seen as an advantage, as it can reveal major conceptual challenges raised by the task, without introducing additional confounds.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
We formalize our task as follows.,3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
"Let U be a set of event types, namely actions or states (represented as predicates) and objects which these actions operate on (represented as arguments to the predicates; mostly ingredients or kitchenware).",3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]

", cn is a list of arguments that the predicate takes (e.g., “salt” or “spoon”).",3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
"Two additional marked events, s and f , correspond to “start” and “finish” events.",3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
"A recipe is a sequence of events in U , starting at s and ending at f .

"Given a recipe R = 〈e1, ..., em〉, we wish to predict the order of the events just from the (multi)set {ei}mi=1.",3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
"In this work we use the textual order of events to approximate their temporal order (see, e.g., Talukdar et al. (2012) for a similar assumption).",3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
"The validity of this assumption for cooking recipes is supported in §6.

Lexical information places quite a few limitations on the order of this recipe.,3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
"For instance, in most cases serving is carried out at the end while putting the ingredients in is done prior to baking them.",3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
"However, lexical knowledge in itself is unlikely to predict the exact ordering of the events
as given in the recipe (e.g., spreading butter might be done before or after baking).

One of the major obstacles in tackling planning problems in AI is the knowledge bottleneck.,3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]
Lexical event ordering is therefore a step towards more ambitious goals in planning.,3 Temporally Ordering Lexical Events,[0],[0]

Data and Preprocessing.,6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
The data is extracted from a recipe repository found on the web.3,6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
The recipes are given as free text.,6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"To extract event types we run the Stanford CoreNLP4 pipeline of a tokenizer, POS tagger, a lexical constituency parser (the englishPCFG parsing model) and extract typed Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"As is common with web extractions, the recipes contain occasional spelling, grammatical and formatting errors.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]

Event Extraction.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"We focus on verbal events and do not extract nominal and adjectival argument structures, which are not as well supported by current parsing technology.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"Any verb is taken to define an event, aside from modal verbs, auxiliaries and secondary verbs.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"A secondary verb (e.g., “let,” “begin”) does not describe an action in its own right, but rather modifies an event introduced by another verb.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"We identify these verbs heuristically using a list given in Dixon (2005, p. 490–491) and a few simple rules defined over parse trees.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]

Temporal and Textual Ordering.,6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"In order to confirm that temporal and textual order of recipes are generally in agreement, we manually examine the first 20 recipes in our development set.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"One recipe was excluded as noise6, resulting in 19 recipes and 353 events.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
We identify the sources of misalignment between the linear order and the temporal order of the events.7 13 events (3.7%) did not have any clear temporal orderings.,6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"These consisted of mostly negations and modalities (e.g., “do not overbrown!”), sub-section headings (e.g., “Preparation”) or other general statements that do not constitute actions or states.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"For the remaining 340 events, we compare their linear and the temporal orderings.
",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
We estimate the frequency of sub-sequences that contradict the temporal order and confirm that they occur only infrequently.,6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"We find that most disagreements fall into these two categories: (1) disjunctions between several events, only one of which will actually take place (e.g., “roll Springerle pin over dough, or press mold into top”); (2) a pair, or less commonly a triplet, of events are expressed in reverse order.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"For instance, “place on greased and floured cookie sheet,” where greasing and flouring should occur before the placing action.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"We note that assuming the alignment of the temporal and textual order

7Events are parsed manually so to avoid confounding the results with the parser’s performance.
of recipes does not suggest that the textual order is the only order of events that would yield the same outcome.
",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"We compute the Kendall’s Tau correlation, a standard measure for information ordering (Lapata, 2006), between the temporal and linear orderings for each recipe.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"In cases of several events that happen simultaneously (including disjunctions), we take their ordinals to be equal.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"For instance, for three events where the last two happen at the same time, we take their ordering to be (1,2,2) in our analysis.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]
"We find that indeed temporal and textual orderings are in very high agreement, with 6 recipes of the 19 perfectly aligned.",6 The Recipe Dataset,[0],[0]

A micro-averaged accuracy measure is used so as not to disproportionately weigh short recipes.,7 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]

"deep-coref incorporates a large set of embeddings, i.e. embeddings of the head, first, last, two previous/following words, and the dependency governor of a mention in addition to the averaged embeddings of the five previous/following words, all words of the mention, sentence words, and document words.",3 Out-of-Domain Evaluation,[0],[0]

We add WikiCoref’s words to deep-coref ’s dictionary for both deep-coref [conll] and deep-coref [lea].,3 Out-of-Domain Evaluation,[0],[0]
deep-coref− reports the performance of deep-coref [lea] in which WikiCoref’s words are not incorporated into the dictionary.,3 Out-of-Domain Evaluation,[0],[0]

"The results of the pt genre show that when there is a high overlap between the training and test datasets, the performance of all learning-based classifiers significantly improves.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
deep-coref has the largest gain from including pt in the training data that is more than 13% based on the LEA score.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
cort uses both lexical and a relatively large number of non-lexical features while berkeley-surface is a pure lexicalized system.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"However, the difference between the berkeley-surface’s performances when pt is included or excluded from the training data is lower than that of cort.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
berkeley uses feature-value pruning so lexical features that occur fewer than 20 times are pruned from the training data.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"Maybe, this is the reason that berkeley’s performance difference is less than other lexicalized systems in highly overlapping datasets.

"For a less overlapping genre, i.e. wb, the performance gain of including the genre in the training data is significantly lower for all lexicalized systems.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]

"deep-coref, which uses a complex deep neural network and mainly lexical features, has the highest gain from the redundancy in the training and test datasets.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"As we use more complex neural networks, there is more capacity for brute-force memorization of the training dataset.
",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"It is also worth noting that the performance gains and drops in out-of-domain evaluations are
not entirely because of lexical features, as the performance of cort−lexical also drops significantly in pt out-of-domain evaluation.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]

We further analyze the output of deep-coref on the development set.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
The all rows in Table 4 show the number of pairwise links that are created by deep-coref on the development set for different mention types.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]

All ratios are surprisingly high.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"The most worrisome cases are those in which both mentions are either a proper name or a common noun.

Table 5 further divides the links of Table 4 based on whether they are correct coreferent links.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"The results of Table 5 show that most of the incorrect links are also made between the mentions that are both seen in the training data.

"The high ratios indicate that (1) there is a high
overlap between the mention pairs of the training and development sets, and (2) even though that deep-coref uses generalized word embeddings instead of exact surface forms, it is strongly biased towards the seen mentions.

We analyze the links that are created by Stanford’s rule-based system and compute the ratio of the links that exist in the training set.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
All corresponding ratios are lower than those of deep-coref in Table 5.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"However, the ratios are surprisingly high for a system that does not use the training data.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
This analysis emphasizes the overlap in the CoNLL datasets.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"Because of this high overlap, it is not easy to assess the generalizability of a coreference resolver to unseen mentions on the CoNLL dataset given its official split.

"We also compute the ratios of Table 5 for the missing links that are associated with the recall er-

"We compute the recall errors by cort error analysis tool (Martschat and Strube, 2014).",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
Table 6 shows the corresponding ratios for recall errors.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"The lower ratios of Table 6 in comparison to those of Table 4 emphasize the bias of deep-coref towards the seen mentions.

"For example, the deep-coref links include 31 cases in which both mentions are either proper names or common nouns and the head of one of the mentions is “country”.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"For all these links, “country” is linked to a mention that is seen in the training data.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"Therefore, this raises the question how the classifier would perform on a text about countries not mentioned in the training data.

Memorizing the pairs in which one of them is a common noun could help the classifier to capture world knowledge to some extent.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
"From the seen pairs like (Haiti, his country), and (Guangzhou, the city) the classifier could learn that “Haiti” is a country and “Guangzhou” is a city.",4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]

The coreference relation of two nominal noun phrases with no head match can be very hard to resolve.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]

The effect of lexical features is also analyzed by Levy et al. (2015) for tasks like hypernymy and entailment.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
They show that state-of-the-art classifiers memorize words from the training data.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]
The classifiers benefit from this lexical memorization when there are common words between the training and test sets.,4 Why do Improvements Fade Away?,[0],[0]

This bias holds us back from developing more robust and generalizable coreference resolvers.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"After all, while coreference resolution is an important step for text understanding, it is not an endtask.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
Coreference resolvers are going to be used in tasks and domains for which coreference annotated corpora may not be available.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]

"Moreover, we show that there is a significant overlap between the training and validation sets in the CoNLL dataset.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The LEA metric (Moosavi and Strube, 2016) is introduced as an attempt to make coreference evaluations more reliable.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, in order to ensure valid developments on coreference resolution, it is not enough to have reliable evaluation metrics.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
The validation set on which the evaluations are performed also needs to be reliable.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"A dataset is reliable for evaluations if a considerable improvement on this dataset indicates a better solution for the coreference problem instead of a better exploitation of the dataset itself.

This paper is not intended to argue against the use of lexical features.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Especially, when word embeddings are used as lexical features.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
The incorporation of word embeddings is an efficient way for capturing semantic relatedness.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
Maybe we should use them more for describing the context and less for describing the mentions themselves.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Pruning rare lexical features plus incorporating more generalizable features could also help to prevent overfitting.

"To ensure more meaningful improvements, we ask to incorporate out-of-domain evaluations in the current coreference evaluation scheme.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]

Dagan et al. 2006) or event extraction (see Grishman and Sundheim 1996 et seq), and it seems unlikely to be a trivial phenomenon to capture, given the complexity and variability of the inferences involved (see, e.g., Karttunen, 2012, 2013; Karttunen et al., 2014; van Leusen, 2012; White, 2014; Baglini and Francez, 2016; Nadathur, 2016, on implicatives).

"In this paper, we investigate how well current state-of-the-art neural systems for a subtask of general event extraction – event factuality prediction (EFP; Nairn et al., 2006; Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2009, 2012; de Marneffe et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2015; Stanovsky et al., 2017; Rudinger et al., 2018) – capture inferential interactions between lexical items and syntactic context – lexicosyntactic inferences – when trained on current event factuality datasets.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Probing these particular systems is useful for understanding neural systems’ behavior more generally because (i) the best performing neural models for EFP (Rudinger et al., 2018) are simple instances of common baseline models; and (ii) the task itself is relatively constrained.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To do this, we substantially extend the MegaVeridicality1 dataset (White and Rawlins, 2018) to cover all English clause-embedding verbs in a variety of the syntactic contexts covered by recent psycholinguistic work (White and Rawlins, 2016), and we use the resulting dataset – MegaVeridicality2 – to probe these models’ behavior.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We focus on clause-embedding verbs because they show effectively every possible patterning of lexicosyntactic inference (Karttunen, 2012).

We discuss three findings: (i) Tree biLSTMs,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"(TbiLSTMs) are better able to correctly predict lexicosyntactic inferences than linear-chain biLSTMs
(L-biLSTMs); (ii) L-biLSTMs and T-biLSTMs capture different lexicosyntactic inferences, and thus ensembling their predictions can reliably improve performance; and (iii) even when ensembled, these models show systematic errors – e.g. performing well when the polarity of the matrix clause matches the polarity of the true inference, but poorly when these polarities mismatch.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We furthermore release MegaVeridicality2 at MegaAttitude.io as a benchmark for probing the ability of neural systems – whether for factuality prediction or for general natural language inference – to capture lexicosyntactic inference.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We substantially extend the MegaVeridicality1 dataset (White and Rawlins, 2018), which contains factuality judgments for all English clauseembedding verbs that take tensed subordinate clauses.",2 Data collection,[0],[0]
"In White and Rawlins’s annotation protocol, all verbs that are grammatical with such subordinate clauses – based on the MegaAttitude dataset (White and Rawlins, 2016) – are slotted into contexts either like (5a) or (5b), depending on whether they take a direct object or not.",2 Data collection,[0],[0]

"For each sentence generated in this way, 10 different annotators are asked to answer the question did that thing happen?:",2 Data collection,[0],[0]
"yes, maybe or maybe not, no.
",2 Data collection,[0],[0]
There are two important aspects of these contexts to note.,2 Data collection,[0],[0]
"First, all lexical items besides the embedding verbs are semantically bleached to ensure that the measured lexicosyntactic inferences are only due to interactions between the embedding predicate – e.g. know or tell – and the syntactic context.",2 Data collection,[0],[0]
"Second, the matrix polarity – i.e. the presence or absence of not as a direct dependent of the embedding verb – is manipulated to create two sentences for each verb-context pair.

"To build a factuality prediction test set from these sentences, we combine MegaVeridicality1 with our dataset and replace each instance of a particular person or a particular thing with someone or something (respectively).",2 Data collection,[0],[0]
"Then, following White and Rawlins, we normalize the 10 responses for each sentence to a single real value using an ordinal mixed model-based procedure.",2 Data collection,[0],[0]
We refer to the resulting dataset as MegaVeridicality2.,2 Data collection,[0],[0]
"We use MegaVeridicality2 to evaluate the performance of three state-of-the-art neural models of
event factuality (Rudinger et al., 2018): a linearchain biLSTM (L-biLSTM), a dependency tree biLSTM",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"(T-biLSTM), and a hybrid biLSTM (HbiLSTM) that ensembles the two.",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"To predict the factuality of the event referred to by a particular predicate, these models pass the output state of the biLSTM at that predicate through a two-layer regression.",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"In the case of the H-biLSTM, the output state of both the L- and T-biLSTMs are simply concatenated and passed through the regression.2
Following the multi-task training regime described by Rudinger et al. (2018), we train these models on four standard factuality datasets – FactBank (Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2009, 2012), UW (Lee et al., 2015), MEANTIME (Minard et al., 2016), and UDS (White et al., 2016; Rudinger et al., 2018) – with tied biLSTM weights but regression parameters specific to each dataset.",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"We then use these trained models to predict the factuality of the embedded predicate in our dataset.
",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"To understand how much of these models’ performance on our dataset is really due to a correct computation of lexicosyntactic inferences, we also generate predictions for the sentences in our dataset with the embedding verbs UNKed.",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"In this case, the model can rely only on the syntactic context surrounding the predicate to make its inferences.",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"We refer to the models with lexical information as the LEX models and the ones without lexical information as the UNK models.
",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"Each model produces four predictions, corresponding to the four different datasets it was trained on.",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"We consider three different ways of ensembling these predictions using a cross-validated ridge regression: (i) ensembling the four predictions for each specific model (LEX or UNK); (ii) ensembling the predictions for the LEX version of a particular model with the UNK version of that same model (LEX+UNK); and (iii) ensembling the predictions across all models (LEX, UNK, or LEX+UNK).",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]
"Each ensemble is evaluated in a 10- fold/10-fold nested cross-validation (see Cawley and Talbot, 2010).",3 Model and evaluation,[0],[0]

fold test sets of the nested cross-validation described in §3.,4 Results,[0],[0]
"We note three aspects of this plot.
",4 Results,[0],[0]
"First, among the LEX models, the T-biLSTM performs best, followed by the L-biLSTM, then the H-biLSTM.",4 Results,[0],[0]
"This is somewhat surprising, since Rudinger et al. find the opposite pattern of performance: the L- and H-biLSTMs vie for dominance, both outperforming the T-biLSTM.",4 Results,[0],[0]
"This indicates that T-biLSTMs are better able to represent the lexicosyntactic inferences relevant to this dataset, even though they underperform on more general datasets.",4 Results,[0],[0]
"This possibility is bolstered by the fact that, in contrast to the L- and H-biLSTMs, the LEX version of the T-biLSTMs performs significantly better than the UNK version, suggesting that the T-biLSTM is potentially more reliant on the lexical information than the other two.
",4 Results,[0],[0]
"Second, when the LEX and UNK version of each model is ensembled (LEX+UNK), we find comparable performance for all three biLSTMs – each outperforming the LEX version of the TbiLSTM.",4 Results,[0],[0]
"This indicates that each model captures similar amounts of information about lexicosyntactic inference, but this information is captured in the models’ parameterizations in different ways.
",4 Results,[0],[0]
"Finally, when all three models are ensembled, we find that both the LEX and UNK version perform significantly better than any specific LEX+UNK model.",4 Results,[0],[0]
"This may indicate two things: (i) the models that only have access to syntax can perform just as well as ones that have access to both lexical information and syntax; but (ii) these models appear to capture different aspects of inference, since an ensemble of all models (AllLEX+UNK) performs significantly better than ei-
ther the All-LEX or All-UNK ensembles alone.",4 Results,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, however, even this ensemble performs more than 10 points worse than each model alone on FactBank, UW, and UDS.",4 Results,[0],[0]
This raises the question of which lexicosyntactic inferences these models are missing – investigated below.,4 Results,[0],[0]
We investigate two questions: (i) which inferences do all models do poorly on?; and (ii) what drives the differing strengths of each model?,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
Where do all models fail?,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows the 20 sentences with the highest prediction errors under the All-LEX+UNK ensemble.,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
There are two interesting things to note about these sentences.,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"First, most of them involve negative lexicosyntactic inferences that the model predicts to be either positive or near zero.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Second, when the true inference is not positive, the matrix polarity of the original sentence is negative.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"This suggests that the models are not able to capture inferences whose polarity mismatches the matrix clause polarity.
",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
One question that arises here is whether this inability affects all contexts equally.,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"To answer this, we regress the absolute error of the predictions from this same ensemble (logged and standardized) against true factuality, matrix polarity, and context (as well as all of their two- and three-way interactions).3",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"We find that the three-way interactions in this regression are reliable ( 2(8)=27.97, p < 0.001) – suggesting that there are nontrivial differences in these state-of-the-art factuality systems’ ability to capture inferential interactions across verbs and syntactic contexts.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"The differences can be verified visually in Figure 2, which

"This suggests these models do not capture an important inferential interaction between passivization and eventivity.
",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"This suggestion is further bolstered by the fact that the ensemble’s ability to predict cases where the matrix polarity mismatches the true factuality are reliably poorer in context (7c) but not in its minimal pairs (7e) and (7b), where the ensemble performs reliably poorer when the two match.",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]

What drives differences between models?,NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"In §4, we noted two ways that the biLSTMs we in-
vestigate differ: (i) the T-biLSTM appears to be more reliant on lexical information than L- and HbiLSTMs; and (ii) each model appears to encode information about lexicosyntactic inference in its parameterizations in different ways.",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"We hypothesize that these two differences are related – specifically, that the T-biLSTM’s heavier reliance on lexical information comes about as a consequence of stronger entanglement between lexical and syntactic information in its hidden states.
",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"To probe this, we ask to what extent the embedding verb’s embedding can be recovered from the embedded verb’s hidden state using linear functions.",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"If the lexical information is more strongly entangled with the syntactic information, it should be more difficult to construct a homomorphic (linear) function to decode the embedding verb’s embedding from the embedded verb’s hidden state.",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"To measure this, we conduct a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA; Hotelling, 1936) between these two vector space representations for every sentence in our dataset.",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"Given two matrices X (the embedding verb embeddings column stacked) and Y (the embedded verb hidden states column stacked), CCA constructs matrices A and B, such that ai,bi = arga0,b0max corr(a0X,b0Y) and corr(aiX,ajX) = corr(biY,bjY) = 0, 8i <",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]

We find that the canonical correlations associated with the T-biLSTM are substantially lower than those associated with the Land H-biLSTMs across these first 50 components.,NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"This suggests that the T-biLSTM more strongly entangles lexical and syntactic information, per-
haps explaining its apparently heavier reliance on lexical information, observed in §4.
",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]
"Of note here is that the pattern seen in Figure 3 is probably at least partly a consequence of the different nonlinearities used for the L-biLSTM (tanh) and T-biLSTM (ReLU), and not the architectures themselves.",NP _ed that S NP was _ed that S NP _ed for NP to VP,[0],[0]

"Aspect extraction is a key task of opinion mining (Liu, 2012).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It extracts opinion targets from opinion text.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, from the sentence “The screen is great”, it aims to extract “screen”, which is a product feature, also called an aspect.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Aspect extraction is commonly done using a supervised or an unsupervised approach.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The unsupervised approach includes methods such as frequent pattern mining (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Zhu et al., 2009), syntactic rules-based extraction (Zhuang et al., 2006; Wang and Wang, 2008; Wu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2011; Poria et al., 2014), topic modeling (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Li et al., 2010; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Lin and He, 2009; Zhao et al., 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011; Fang and Huang, 2012; Wang et al., 2016), word alignment (Liu et al., 2013), label propagation (Zhou et al., 2013; Shu et al., 2016), and others (Zhao et al., 2015).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper focuses on the supervised approach (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Choi and Cardie,
2010; Mitchell et al., 2013) using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It shows that the results of CRF can be significantly improved by leveraging some prior knowledge automatically mined from the extraction results of previous domains, including domains without labeled data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The improvement is possible because although every product (domain) is different, there is a fair amount of aspects sharing across domains (Chen and Liu, 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, every review domain has the aspect price and reviews of many products have the aspect battery life or screen.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Those shared aspects may not appear in the training data but appear in unlabeled data and the test data.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We can exploit such sharing to help CRF perform much better.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Due to leveraging the knowledge gained from the past to help the new domain extraction, we are using the idea of lifelong machine learning (LML) (Chen and Liu, 2016; Thrun, 1998; Silver et al., 2013), which is a continuous learning paradigm that retains the knowledge learned in the past and uses it to help future learning and problem solving with possible adaptations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The setting of the proposed approach L-CRF (Lifelong CRF) is as follows: A CRF model M has been trained with a labeled training review dataset.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"At a particular point in time, M has extracted aspects from data in n previous domains D1, . . .",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
", Dn (which are unlabeled) and the extracted sets of aspects are A1, . . .",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
", An.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Now, the system is faced with a new domain data Dn+1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"M can leverage some reliable prior knowledge in A1, . . .",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
", An to make a better extraction fromDn+1 than without leveraging this prior knowledge.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The key innovation of L-CRF is that even after supervised training, the model can still improve its extraction in testing or its applications with experiences.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Note that L-CRF is different from semisupervised learning (Zhu, 2005) as the n previous
148
(unlabeled) domain data used in extraction are not used or not available during model training.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There are prior LML works for aspect extraction (Chen et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016), but they were all unsupervised methods.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Supervised LML methods exist (Chen et al., 2015; Ruvolo and Eaton, 2013), but they are for classification rather than for sequence learning or labeling like CRF.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A semi-supervised LML method is used in NELL (Mitchell et al., 2015), but it is heuristic patternbased.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It doesn’t use sequence learning and is not for aspect extraction.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"LML is related to transfer learning and multi-task learning (Pan and Yang, 2010), but they are also quite different (see (Chen and Liu, 2016) for details).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that uses LML to help a supervised extraction method to markedly improve its results.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"CRF learns from an observation sequence x to estimate a label sequence y: p(y|x;θ), where θ is a set of weights.",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
Let l be the l-th position in the sequence.,2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"The core parts of CRF are a set of feature functions F = {fh(yl, yl−1,xl)}Hh=1 and their corresponding weights θ = {θh}Hh=1.",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
Feature Functions: We use two types of feature functions (FF).,2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"One is Label-Label (LL) FF:
fLLij (yl, yl−1)",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"= 1{yl = i}1{yl−1 = j},∀i, j ∈ Y, (1)
where Y is the set of labels, and 1{·} an indicator function.",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
The other is Label-Word (LW),2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"FF:
fLWiv (yl,xl) = 1{yl = i}1{xl = v}, ∀i ∈ Y,∀v ∈ V, (2)
where V is the vocabulary.",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
This FF returns 1 when the l-th word is v and the l-th label is v’s specific label i; otherwise 0.,2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"xl is the current word, and is represented as a multi-dimensional vector.",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"Each dimension in the vector is a feature of xl.
",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"Following the previous work in (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010), we use the feature set {W, -1W, +1W, P, -1P, +1P, G}, where W is the word and P is its POS-tag, -1W is the previous word, -1P is its POS-tag, +1W is the next word, +1P is its POStag, and G is the generalized dependency feature.
",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"Under the Label-Word FF type, we have two sub-types of FF: Label-dimension FF and Label-G FF.",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"Label-dimension FF is for the first 6 features, and Label-G is for the G feature.
",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"The Label-dimension (Ld) FF is defined as
fLd ivd (yl,xl) = 1{yl = i}1{xdl = vd},∀i ∈ Y, ∀vd ∈",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"Vd, (3)
where Vd is the set of observed values in feature d ∈ {W,−1W,+1W,P,−1P,+1P}",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
and we call Vd feature d’s feature values.,2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
Eq. (3) is a FF that returns 1 when xl’s feature d equals to the feature value vd and the variable yl (lth label) equals to the label value i; otherwise,2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
"0.
We describe G and its feature function next, which also holds the key to the proposed L-CRF.",2 Conditional Random Fields,[0],[0]
Feature G uses generalized dependency relations.,3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
What is interesting about this feature is that it enables L-CRF to use past knowledge in its sequence prediction at the test time in order to perform much better.,3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
This will become clear shortly.,3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
"This feature takes a dependency pattern as its value, which is generalized from dependency relations.
",3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
The general dependency feature (G) of the variable xl takes a set of feature values VG.,3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
Each feature value vG is a dependency pattern.,3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
"The LabelG (LG) FF is defined as:
fLG ivG (yl,xl) =",3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
"1{yl = i}1{xGl = vG},∀i ∈ Y, ∀vG ∈ VG.",3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
"(4)
Such a FF returns 1 when the dependency feature of the variable xl equals to a dependency pattern vG and the variable yl equals to the label value i.",3 General Dependency Feature (G),[0],[0]
"Dependency relations have been shown useful in many sentiment analysis applications (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010).",3.1 Dependency Relation,[0],[0]
"A dependency relation 1 is a quintuple-tuple: (type, gov, govpos, dep, deppos), where type is the type of the dependency relation, gov is the governor word, govpos is the POS tag of the governor word, dep is the dependent word, and deppos is the POS tag of the dependent word.",3.1 Dependency Relation,[0],[0]
The l-th word can either be the governor word or the dependent word in a dependency relation.,3.1 Dependency Relation,[0],[0]
"We generalize dependency relations into dependency patterns using the following steps:
1.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"For each dependency relation, replace the current word (governor word or dependent word) and its POS tag with a wildcard since we already have the word (W) and the POS tag (P) features.
",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"1We obtain dependency relations using Stanford CoreNLP: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/.
2.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
Replace the context word (the word other than the l-th word) in each dependency relation with a knowledge label to form a more general dependency pattern.,3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
Let the set of aspects annotated in the training data be Kt.,3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"If the context word in the dependency relation appears in Kt, we replace it with a knowledge label ‘A’ (aspect); otherwise ‘O’ (other).
",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"For example, we work on the sentence “The battery of this camera is great.”",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
The dependency relations are given in Table 1.,3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"Assume the current word is “battery,” and “camera” is annotated as an aspect.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"The original dependency relation between “camera” and “battery” produced by a parser is (nmod, battery, NN, camera, NN).",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
Note that we do not use the word positions in the relations in Table 1.,3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"Since the current word’s information (the word itself and its POS-tag) in the dependency relation is redundant, we replace it with a wild-card.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"The relation becomes (nmod, *, camera, NN).",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"Secondly, since “camera” is in Kt, we replace “camera” with a general label ‘A’.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"The final dependency pattern becomes (nmod,*, A, NN).
",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
We now explain why dependency patterns can enable a CRF model to leverage the past knowledge.,3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"The key is the knowledge label ‘A’ above, which indicates a likely aspect.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"Recall that our problem setting is that when we need to extract from the new domain Dn+1 using a trained CRF model M , we have already extracted from many previous domains D1, . . .",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
", Dn and retained their extracted sets of aspects A1, . . .",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
", An.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"Then, we can mine reliable aspects from A1, . . .",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
", An and add them in Kt, which enables many knowledge labels in the dependency patterns of the new data An+1 due to sharing of aspects across domains.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
"This enriches the dependency pattern features, which consequently allows more aspects to be extracted from the new domain Dn+1.",3.2 Dependency Pattern,[0],[0]
We now present the L-CRF algorithm.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]

",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
Let K be a set of reliable aspects mined from the aspects extracted in past domain datasets using the CRF model M .,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
Note that we assume that M has already been trained using some labeled training data Dt.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Initially, K is Kt (the set of all annotated aspects in the training data Dt).",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"The more domainsM has worked on, the more aspects it extracts, and the larger the set K gets.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"When faced with a new domain Dn+1, K allows the general dependency feature to generate more dependency patterns related to aspects due to more knowledge labels ‘A’ as we explained in the previous section.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Consequently, CRF has more informed features to produce better extraction results.
",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
L-CRF works in two phases: training phase and lifelong extraction phase.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"The training phase trains a CRF model M using the training data Dt, which is the same as normal CRF training, and will not be discussed further.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"In the lifelong extraction phase, M is used to extract aspects from coming domains (M does not change and the domain data are unlabeled).",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"All the results from the domains are retained in past aspect store S. At
a particular time, it is assumed M has been applied to n past domains, and is now faced with the n + 1 domain.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
L-CRF uses M and reliable aspects (denoted Kn+1) mined from S and Kt (K = Kt ∪ Kn+1) to extract from Dn+1.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Note that aspects Kt from the training data are considered always reliable as they are manually labeled, thus a subset ofK. We cannot use all extracted aspects from past domains as reliable aspects due to many extraction errors.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
But those aspects that appear in multiple past domains are more likely to be correct.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"ThusK contains those frequent aspects in S. The lifelong extraction phase is in Algorithm 1.
",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Lifelong Extraction Phase: Algorithm 1 performs extraction on Dn+1 iteratively.
1.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"It generates features (F ) on the data Dn+1 (line 3), and applies the CRF model M on F to produce a set of aspects An+1",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]

2. An+1 is added to S, the past aspect store.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"From S, we mine a set of frequent aspects Kn+1.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"The frequency threshold is λ.
3.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"If Kn+1 is the same as Kp from the previous iteration, the algorithm exits as no new aspects can be found.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"We use an iterative process because each extraction gives new results, which may increase the size of K, the reliable past aspects or past knowledge.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
"The increased K may produce more dependency patterns, which can enable more extractions.
4.",4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
Else: some additional reliable aspects are found.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
M may extract additional aspects in the next iteration.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
Lines 10 and 11 update the two sets for the next iteration.,4 The Proposed L-CRF Algorithm,[0],[0]
We now evaluate the proposed L-CRF method and compare with baselines.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We use two types of data for our experiments.,5.1 Evaluation Datasets,[0],[0]
The first type consists of seven (7) annotated benchmark review datasets from 7 domains (types of products).,5.1 Evaluation Datasets,[0],[0]
"Since they are annotated, they are used in training and testing.",5.1 Evaluation Datasets,[0],[0]
"The first 4 datasets are from (Hu and Liu, 2004), which actually has 5 datasets from 4 domains.",5.1 Evaluation Datasets,[0],[0]
"Since we are mainly interested in results at the domain level, we did not use one of the domain-repeated datasets.",5.1 Evaluation Datasets,[0],[0]
"The last 3 datasets of three domains (products) are from (Liu et al., 2016).",5.1 Evaluation Datasets,[0],[0]
These datasets are used to make up our CRF training data Dt and test data Dn+1.,5.1 Evaluation Datasets,[0],[0]

It treats the reliable aspect set K as a dictionary.,5.2 Baseline Methods,[0],[0]
It adds those reliable aspects in K that are not extracted by CRF but are in the test data to the final results.,5.2 Baseline Methods,[0],[0]
"We want to see whether incorporating K into the CRF extraction through dependency patterns in L-CRF is actually needed.

In-domain experiments: We train and test on the same 6 domains (1200 sentences for training and 1200 sentences for testing).,5.3 Experiment Setting,[0],[0]
"This also gives us 7 in-domain results.

We can see that L-CRF is markedly better than CRF and CRF+R in F1.,5.4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"CRF+R is very poor due to poor precisions, which shows treating the reliable aspects set K as a dictionary isn’t a good idea.
",5.4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
In-domain: −X in training and test columns means that the other 6 domains are used in both training and testing (thus in-domain).,5.4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
We again see that L-CRF is consistently better than CRF and CRF+R in F1.,5.4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
The amount of gain is smaller.,5.4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
This is expected because most aspects appeared in training probably also appear in the test data as they are reviews from the same 6 products.,5.4 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
This paper proposed a lifelong learning method to enable CRF to leverage the knowledge gained from extraction results of previous domains (unlabeled) to improve its extraction.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Experimental results showed the effectiveness of L-CRF.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
The current approach does not change the CRF model itself.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"A core problem of opinion mining or sentiment analysis is to identify each opinion/sentiment target and to classify the opinion/sentiment polarity on the target (Liu, 2012).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, in a review sentence for a car, one wrote “Although the engine is slightly weak, this car is great.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The person is positive (opinion polarity) about the car (opinion target) as a whole, but slightly negative (opinion polarity) about the car’s engine (opinion target).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Past research has proposed many techniques to extract opinion targets (we will just call them targets
hereafter for simplicity) and also to classify sentiment polarities on the targets.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, a target can be an entity or an aspect (part or attribute) of an entity.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"“Engine” in the above sentence is just one aspect of the car, while “this car” refers to the whole car.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Note that in (Liu, 2012), an entity is called a general aspect.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For effective opinion mining, we need to classify whether a target is an entity or an aspect because they refer to very different things.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One can be positive about the whole entity (car) but negative about some aspects of it (e.g., engine) and vice versa.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper aims to perform the target classification task, which, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although in supervised extraction one can annotate entities and aspects with separate labels in the training data to build a model to extract them separately, in this paper our goal is to help unsupervised target extraction methods to classify targets.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Unsupervised target extraction methods are often preferred because they save the time-consuming data labeling or annotation step for each domain.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Problem Statement:,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given a set of opinion targets T = {t1, . . .",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
", tn} extracted from an opinion corpus d, we want to classify each target ti ∈ T into one of the three classes, entity, aspect, or NIL, which are called class labels.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"NIL means that the target is neither an entity nor an aspect and is used because target extraction algorithms can make mistakes.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This paper does not propose a new target extraction algorithm.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We use an existing unsupervised method, called Double Propagation (DP) (Qiu et al., 2011), for extraction.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We only focus on target classification after the targets have been extracted.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Note that an entity here can be a named entity, a prod-
225
uct category, or an abstract product (e.g., “this machine” and “this product”).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An named entity can be the name of a brand, a model, or a manufacturer.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An aspect is a part or attribute of an entity, e.g., “battery” and “price” of the entity “camera”.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since our entities not just include the traditional named entities (e.g., “Microsoft” and “Google”) but also other expressions that refer to such entities, traditional named entity recognition algorithms are not sufficient.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Pronouns such as “it,” “they,” etc., are not considered in this paper as co-reference resolution is out of the scope of this work.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We solve this problem in an unsupervised manner so that there is no need for labor-intensive manual labeling of the training data.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One key observation of the problem is that although entities and aspects are different, they are closely related because aspects are parts or attributes of entities and they often have syntactic relationships in a sentence, e.g., “This phone’s screen is super.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Thus it is natural to solve the problem using a relational learning method.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We employ the graph labeling algorithm, Relaxation Labeling (RL) (Hummel and Zucker, 1983), which performs unsupervised belief propagation on a graph.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In our case, each target extracted from the given corpus d forms a graph node and each relation identified in d between two targets forms an edge.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"With some initial probability assignments, RL can assign each target node the most probable class label.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although some other graph labeling methods can be applied as well, the key issue here is that just using a propagation method in isolation is far from sufficient due to lack of information from the given corpus, which we detail in Section 5.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We then employ Lifelong Machine Learning (LML) (Thrun, 1998; Chen and Liu, 2014b) to make a major improvement.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
LML works as follows: The learner has performed a number learning tasks in the past and has retained the knowledge gained so far.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the new/current task, it makes use of the past knowledge to help current learning and problem solving.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since RL is unsupervised, we can assume that the system has performed the same task on reviews of a large number of products/domains (or corpora).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It has also saved all the graphs and classification results from those past domains in a Knowledge Base (KB).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It then exploits this past knowledge to help classification in the current task/domain.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We call this
combined approach of relaxation labeling and LML Lifelong-RL.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The approach is effective because there is a significant amount of sharing of targets and target relations across domains.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
LML is different from the classic learning paradigm (supervised or unsupervised) because classic learning has no memory.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It basically runs a learning algorithm on a given data in isolation without considering any past learned knowledge (Silver et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"LML aims to mimic human learning, which always retains the learned knowledge from the past and uses it to help future learning.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our experimental results show that the proposed Lifelong-RL system is highly promising.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The paradigm of LML helps improve the classification results greatly.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although many target extraction methods exist (Hu and Liu, 2004; Zhuang et al., 2006; Ku et al., 2006; Wang and Wang, 2008; Wu et al., 2009; Lin and He, 2009; Zhang et al., 2010; Mei et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Fang and Huang, 2012; Zhou et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Poria et al., 2014), we are not aware of any attempt to solve the proposed problem.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As mentioned in the introduction, although in supervised target extraction, one can annotate entities and aspects with different labels, supervised methods need manually labeled training data, which is time-consuming and laborintensive to produce (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Choi and Cardie, 2010; Mitchell et al., 2013).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Note that relaxation labeling was used for sentiment classification in (Popescu and Etzioni, 2007), but not for target classification.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More details of opinion mining can be found in (Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work is related to transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010), which uses the source domain labeled data to help target domain learning, which has little or no labeled data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Our work is not just using a source domain to help a target domain.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
It is a continuous and cumulative learning process.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Each new task can make use of the knowledge learned from all past tasks.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Knowledge learned from the new task can also help improve learning of any past task.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Transfer learning is not continuous, does not
accumulate knowledge over time and cannot improve learning in the source domain.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work is also related to multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997), which jointly optimizes a set of related learning tasks.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Clearly, multi-task learning is different as we learn and save information which is more realistic when a large number of tasks are involved.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Our work is most related to Lifelong Machine Learning (LML).,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Traditional LML focuses on supervised learning (Thrun, 1998; Ruvolo and Eaton, 2013; Chen et al., 2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recent work used LML in topic modeling (Chen and Liu, 2014a), which is unsupervised.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Basically, they used topics generated from past domains to help current domain model inference.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, they are just for aspect extraction.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"So is the method in (Liu et al., 2016).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
They do not solve our problem.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Their LML methods are also different from ours as we use a graph and results obtained in the past domains to augment the current task/domain graph to solve the problem.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this section, we present the proposed general framework of lifelong relaxation labeling (LifelongRL).",3 Lifelong-RL: The General Framework,[0],[0]
"We first give an overview of the relaxation labeling algorithm, which forms the base.",3 Lifelong-RL: The General Framework,[0],[0]
We then incorporate it with the LML capability.,3 Lifelong-RL: The General Framework,[0],[0]
The next two sections detail how this general framework is applied to our proposed task of separating entities and aspects in opinion targets.,3 Lifelong-RL: The General Framework,[0],[0]
Relaxation Labeling (RL) is an unsupervised graphbased label propagation algorithm that works iteratively.,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
The graph consists of nodes and edges.,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Each edge represents a binary relationship between two nodes.,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Each node ti in the graph is associated with a multinomial distribution P (L(ti)),3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
(L(ti) being the label of ti) on a label set Y .,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Each edge is associated with two conditional probability distributions P (L(ti)|L(tj)) and P (L(tj)|L(ti)), where P (L(ti)|L(tj)) represents how the label L(tj) influences the label L(ti) and vice versa.",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"The neighbors Ne(ti) of a node ti are associated with a weight distribution w(tj |ti) with ∑ tj∈Ne(ti)w(tj |ti) = 1.
",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Given the initial values of these quantities as inputs, RL iteratively updates the label distribution
of each node until convergence.",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Initially, we have P 0(L(ti)).",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Let ∆P r+1(L(ti)),3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
be the change of P (L(ti)) at iteration r+ 1.,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Given P r(L(ti)) at iteration r, ∆P r+1(L(ti)) is computed by:
∆P r+1(L(ti))",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"= ∑
tj∈Ne(ti)(w(tj |ti) ·∑y∈Y (P (L(ti)|L(tj) = y)P r(L(tj) = y)))",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"(1) Then, the updated label distribution for iteration
r + 1, P r+1(L(ti)), is computed as follows:
P r+1(L(ti))",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"= P r(L(ti))(1+∆P
r+1(L(ti)))∑ y∈Y P r(L(ti)=y)(1+∆P r+1(L(ti)=y))
(2)
",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Once RL ends, the final label of node ti is its highest probable label: L(ti) =",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"argmax
y∈Y (P (L(ti) = y)).
",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Note that P (L(ti)|L(tj)) and w(tj |ti) are not updated in each RL iteration but only P (L(ti)) is.,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"P (L(ti)|L(tj)), w(tj |ti) and P 0(L(ti)) are provided by the user or computed based on the application context.",3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
RL uses these values as input and iteratively updates P (L(ti)) based on Equations (1) and (2) until convergence.,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Next we discuss how to incorporate LML in RL.,3.1 Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"For LML, it is assumed that at any time step, the system has worked on u past domain corpora D = {d1, . . .",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
", du}.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"For each past domain corpus d ∈ D, the same Lifelong-RL algorithm was applied and its results were saved in the Knowledge Base (KB).",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Then the algorithm can borrow some useful prior/past knowledge in the KB to help RL in the new/current domain du+1.,3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Once the results of the current domain are produced, they are also added to the KB for future use.
",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"We now detail the specific types of information or knowledge that can be obtained from the past domains to help RL in the future, which should thus be stored in the KB.
1.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Prior edges: In many applications, the graph is not given.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Instead, it has to be constructed based on the data from the new task/domain data du+1.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"However, due to the limited data in du+1, some edges between nodes that should be present are not extracted from the data.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"But such edges between the nodes may exist in
some past domains.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Then, those edges and their associated probabilities can be borrowed.
2.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Prior labels: Some nodes in the current new domain may also exist in some past domains.,3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
Their labels in the past domains are very likely to be the same as those in the current domain.,3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"Then, those prior labels can give us a better idea about the initial label probability distributions of the nodes in the current domain du+1.
",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"To leverage those edges and labels from the past domains, the system needs to ensure that they are likely to be correct and applicable to the current task domain.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
This is a challenge problem.,3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"In the next two sections, we detail how to ensure these to a large extent in our application context along with how to compute those initial probabilities.",3.2 Lifelong Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
We now discuss how the proposed Lifelong-RL general framework is applied to solve our problem.,4 Initialization of Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"In our case, each node in the graph is an extracted target ti ∈ T , and each edge represents a binary relationship between two targets.",4 Initialization of Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"T is the given set of all opinion targets extracted by an extraction algorithm from a review dataset/corpus d. The label set for each target is Y = {entity, aspect,NIL}.",4 Initialization of Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"In this section, we describe how to use text clues in the corpus d to compute P (L(ti)|L(tj)), w(tj |ti) and P 0(L(ti)).",4 Initialization of Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"In the next section, we present how these quantities are improved using prior knowledge from the past domains in the LML fashion.",4 Initialization of Relaxation Labeling,[0],[0]
"We use two kinds of text clues, called type modifiers M(t) and relation modifiers MR to compute the initial label distribution P (L(ti)) and conditional label distribution P (L(ti)|L(tj)) respectively.

Type Modifier:,4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"This has two kinds MT = {mE ,mA}, where mE and mA represent entity modifier and aspect modifier respectively.",4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"For example, the word “this” as in “this camera is great” indicates that “camera” is probably an entity.",4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"Thus, “this” is a type modifier indicating M(camera) = mE .",4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
“These” is also a type modifier.,4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"Aspect modifier is implicitly assumed when the number of appearances of entity modifiers is less than or equal to a threshold (see Section 4.2).

Relation Modifier:,4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"Given two targets, ti and tj , we use Mtj (ti) to denote the relation modifier that the label of target ti is influenced by the label of target tj .",4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"Relation modifiers are further divided into 3 kinds: MR = {mc,mA|E ,mE|A}.
",4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
Conjunction modifier mc: Conjoined items are usually of the same type.,4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"For example, in “price and service”, “and service” indicates a conjunction modifier for “price” and vice versa.
",4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
Entity-aspect modifier mA|E : A possessive expression indicates an entity and an aspect relation.,4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
"For example, in “the camera’s battery”, “camera” indicates an entity-aspect modifier for “battery”.

"Aspect-entity modifier mE|A: Same as above except that “battery” indicates an aspect-entity modifier for “camera”.

Modifier Extraction: These modifiers are identified from the corpus d using three syntactic rules.,4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]
“This” and “these” are used to extract type modifier M(t) = mE .,4.1 Text Clues for Initialization,[0],[0]

"Due to the fact that the review corpus du+1 in the current task domain may not be very large and that we use high quality syntactic rules to extract relations to build the graph to ensure precision, the number of relations extracted can be small and insufficient to produce a graph that is information rich with accurate initial probabilities.",5 Using Past Knowledge in Lifelong-RL,[0],[0]

We notice that phrases like “this price” causes low precision.,6.2 Results Analysis,[0],[0]
"Since it does not use many other relations and NER does not recognize many named entities that are written in lower case letters (e.g., “apple is good”), its recall is also low.

RL has a higher precision as it considers relation modifiers.,6.2 Results Analysis,[0],[0]

"For example, “this price” may appear in some domains but “price”’s target label is mostly aspect.",6.2 Results Analysis,[0],[0]
We consider their counts in initial label distributions and thus rectify the initial distribution of “price”.,6.2 Results Analysis,[0],[0]

"Comparison: For aspects, the trend is the same but the improvements are not as dramatic as for entity.",6.2 Results Analysis,[0],[0]

It is well-known that opinions have targets.,abstractText,[0],[0]

",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Combining neural methods with symbolic commonsense knowledge, for instance in the form of implication rules, is in the focus of current research (Rocktäschel et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Bowman et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Vendrov et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016; Rocktäschel and Riedel, 2016; Cohen, 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A recent approach (Rocktäschel et al., 2015) regularizes entity-tuple and relation embeddings via first-order logic rules.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To this end, every first-order rule is propositionalized based on observed entity-tuples, and a differentiable loss term is added for every propositional rule.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This approach does not scale beyond only a few entity-tuples and rules.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, propositionalizing the rule ∀x : isMan(x)⇒ isMortal(x) would result in a very large number of loss terms on a large database.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we present a method to incorporate simple rules while maintaining the computational efficiency of only modeling training facts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is achieved by minimizing an upper bound of the loss that encourages the implication between relations to hold, entirely independent from the number of entity pairs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It only involves representations of the relations that are mentioned in rules, as well as a general rule-independent constraint on the entity-tuple embedding space.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the example given above, if we require that every component of the
1389
vector representation of isMan is smaller than the corresponding component of relation isMortal, then we can show that the rule holds for any nonnegative representation of an entity-tuple.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Hence our method avoids the need for separate loss terms for every ground atom resulting from propositionalizing rules.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In statistical relational learning this type of approach is often referred to as lifted inference or learning (Poole, 2003; Braz, 2007) because it deals with groups of random variables at a first-order level.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
In this sense our approach is a lifted form of rule injection.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This allows for imposing large numbers of rules while learning distributed representations of relations and entity-tuples.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Besides drastically lower computation time, an important advantage of our method over Rocktäschel et al. (2015) is that when these constraints are satisfied, the injected rules always hold, even for unseen but inferred facts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the method presented here only deals with implications and not general first-order rules, it does not rely on the assumption of independence between relations, and is hence more generally applicable.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our contributions are fourfold: (i) we develop a very efficient way of regularizing relation representations to incorporate first-order logic implications (§3), (ii) we reveal that, against expectation, mapping entity-tuple embeddings to non-negative space does not hurt but instead improves the generalization ability of our model (§5.1) (iii) we show improvements on a knowledge base completion task by injecting mined commonsense rules from WordNet (§5.3), and finally (iv) we give a qualitative analysis of the results, demonstrating that implication constraints are indeed satisfied in an asymmetric way and result in a substantially increased structuring of the relation embedding space (§5.6).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
In this section we revisit the matrix factorization relation extraction model by Riedel et al. (2013) and introduce the notation used throughout the paper.,2 Background,[0],[0]

Model F by Riedel et al. (2013) measures the compatibility between a relation r and an entitytuple t using the dot product r>t of their respective vector representations.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"During training, the representations are learned such that valid facts receive high scores, whereas negative ones receive low scores.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Typically no negative evidence is available at training time, and therefore a Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) objective (Rendle et al., 2009) is used.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Given a pair of facts fp := 〈rp, tp〉 6∈",2 Background,[0],[0]
"O and fq := 〈rq, tq",2 Background,[0],[0]

r>p tp ≤ r>q tq.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"(1)
The embeddings can be trained by minimizing a convex loss function `R that penalizes violations of that requirement when iterating over the training set.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"In practice, each positive training fact 〈r, tq〉 is compared with a randomly sampled unobserved fact 〈r, tp〉 for the same relation.",2 Background,[0],[0]

LR = ∑
〈r,tq〉∈O tp∈T , 〈r,tp〉6∈O
`R ( r>[tp − tq] ) .",2 Background,[0],[0]

and measures how well observed valid facts are ranked above unobserved facts, thus reconstructing the ranking of the training data.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"We will henceforth call LR the reconstruction loss, to make a distinction with the implication loss that we will introduce later.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Riedel et al. (2013) use the logistic loss `R(s) := − log σ(−s), where σ(s) := (1 + e−x)−1 denotes the sigmoid function.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"In order to avoid overfitting, an L2 regularization term on the r and t embeddings is added to the reconstruction loss.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"The overall objective to minimize hence is
LF = LR + α (∑ r‖r‖22 + ∑ t‖t‖22 )

∀t ∈ T : 〈rp, t〉 ⇒ 〈rq, t〉, (4)

"For simplicity, we abbreviate such implications as rp ⇒ rq (e.g., professorAt⇒ employeeAt).",3 Lifted Injection of Implications,[0],[0]
The implication rule can be imposed by requiring that every tuple t ∈ T is at least as compatible with relation rp as with rq.,3.1 Grounded Loss Formulation,[0],[0]

"We can therefore inject an implication rule by minimizing a loss term with a separate contribution from every t ∈ T , adding up to the total loss if the corresponding inequality is not satisfied.",3.1 Grounded Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
"In order to make the contribution of every tuple t to that loss independent of the magnitude of the tuple embedding, we divide both sides of the above inequality by ‖t‖1.",3.1 Grounded Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
"With t̃ := t/‖t‖1, the implication loss for the rule rp ⇒ rq can be written as

"In practice, the summation can be reduced to those tuples that occur in combination with rp or rq in the training data.",3.1 Grounded Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
"Still, the propositionalization in terms of training facts leads to a heavy computational cost for imposing a single implication, similar to the technique introduced in Rocktäschel et al. (2015).",3.1 Grounded Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
"Moreover, with that simplification there is no guarantee that the implication between both relations would generalize towards inferred facts not seen during training.",3.1 Grounded Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
"The problems mentioned above can be avoided if instead of LI , a tuple-independent upper bound is minimized.",3.2 Lifted Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
"Such a bound can be constructed, provided all components of t are restricted to a nonnegative embedding space, i.e., T ⊆ Rk,+.",3.2 Lifted Loss Formulation,[0],[0]

holds, Jensen’s inequality allows us to transform eq.",3.2 Lifted Loss Formulation,[0],[0]

"One such bound is |T |, but others are conceivable too.",3.2 Lifted Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
In practice we rescale β to a hyper-parameter β̃ that we use to control the impact of the upper bound to the overall loss.,3.2 Lifted Loss Formulation,[0],[0]
"We call LUI the lifted loss, as it no longer depends on any of the entity-tuples; it is grounded over the unit tuples 1i instead.
",3.2 Lifted Loss Formulation,[0],[0]

"(11) are possible, but we found that our approach works better in practice than those (e.g., the exponential transformation proposed by Demeester et al. (2016)).",3.3 Approximately Boolean Entity Tuples,[0],[0]
"It can also be observed that the unit tuples over which the implication loss is grounded, form a special case of approximately Boolean embeddings.
",3.3 Approximately Boolean Entity Tuples,[0],[0]
"In order to investigate the impact of this restriction even when not injecting any rules, we introduce model FS: the original model F, but with sigmoidal entity-tuples:
LFS = ∑
〈r,tq〉∈O tp∈T , 〈r,tp〉6∈O
`R ( r>[σ(ep)− σ(eq)] )
+ α (∑ r‖r‖22 + ∑ e‖e‖22 )

",3.3 Approximately Boolean Entity Tuples,[0],[0]
"With the above choice of a non-negative tupleembedding space we can now state the full lifted rule injection model (FSL):

I∈I LUI (14)
LUI denotes a lifted loss term for every rule in a set I of implication rules that we want to inject.",3.3 Approximately Boolean Entity Tuples,[0],[0]
The logistic loss `R (see §2) is not suited for imposing implications because once the inequality in eq.,3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
"(11) is satisfied, the components of rp and rq do not need to be separated any further.",3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
"However, with `R this would continue to happen due to the small non-zero gradient.",3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
In the reconstruction loss LR this is a desirable effect which further separates the scores for positive from negative examples.,3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
"However, if an implication is imposed between two relations that are almost equivalent according to the
training data, we still want to find almost equivalent embedding vectors.",3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
"Hence, we propose to use the loss
`I(s) = max(0, s+ δ) (15)
with δ a small positive margin to ensure that the gradient does not disappear before the inequality is actually satisfied.",3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
"We use δ = 0.01 in all experiments.
",3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
"The main advantage of the presented approach over earlier methods that impose the rules in a grounded way (Rocktäschel et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) is the computational efficiency of imposing the lifted loss.",3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
Evaluating LUI or its gradient for one implication rule is comparable to evaluating the reconstruction loss for one pair of training facts.,3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
In typical applications there are much fewer rules than training facts and the extra computation time needed to inject these rules is therefore negligible.,3.4 Convex Implication Loss,[0],[0]
Recent research on combining rules with learned vector representations has been important for new developments in the field of knowledge base completion.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
Rocktäschel et al. (2014) and Rocktäschel et al. (2015) provided a framework to jointly maximize the probability of observed facts and propositionalized first-order logic rules.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
Wang et al. (2015) demonstrated how different types of rules can be incorporated using an Integer Linear Programming approach.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
Wang and Cohen (2016) learned embeddings for facts and first-order logic rules using matrix factorization.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Yet, all of these approaches ground the rules in the training data, limiting their scalability towards large rule sets and KBs with many entities.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As argued in the introduction, this forms an important motivation for the lifted rule injection model put forward in this work, which by construction does not suffer from that limitation.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wei et al. (2015) proposed an alternative strategy to tackle the scalability problem by reasoning on a filtered subset of grounded facts.
",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wu et al. (2015) proposed to use a path ranking approach for capturing long-range interactions between entities, and to add these as an extra loss term, besides the loss that models pairwise relations.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our model FSL differs substantially from their approach, in that we consider tuples instead of separate entities, and we inject a given set of rules.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Yet, by cre-
ating a partial ordering in the relation embeddings as a result of injecting implication rules, model FSL can also capture interactions beyond direct relations.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This will be demonstrated in §5.3 by injecting rules between surface patterns only and still measuring an improvement on predictions for structured Freebase relations.
",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
Combining logic and distributed representations is also an active field of research outside of automated knowledge base completion.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recent advances include the work by Faruqui et al. (2014), who injected ontological knowledge from WordNet into word representations.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, Vendrov et al. (2016) proposed to enforce a partial ordering in an embeddings space of images and phrases.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
Our method is related to such order embeddings since we define a partial ordering on relation embeddings.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, to ensure that implications hold for all entity-tuples we also need a restriction on the entitytuple embedding space and derive bounds on the loss.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Another important contribution is the recent work by Hu et al. (2016), who proposed a framework for injecting rules into general neural network architectures, by jointly training on the actual targets and on the rule-regularized predictions provided by a teacher network.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Although quite different at first sight, their work could offer a way to use our model in various neural network architectures, by integrating the proposed lifted loss into the teacher network.
",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This paper builds upon our previous workshop paper (Demeester et al., 2016).",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In that work, we tested different tuple embedding transformations in an ad-hoc manner.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We used approximately Boolean representations of relations instead of entity-tuples, strongly reducing the model’s degrees of freedom.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
We now derive the FSL model from a carefully considered mathematical transformation of the grounded loss.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The FSL model only restricts the tuple embedding space, whereby relation vectors remain real valued.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, previous experiments were performed on small-scale artificial datasets, whereas we now test on a real-world relation extraction benchmark.
",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, we explicitly discuss the main differences with respect to the strongly related work from Rocktäschel et al. (2015).",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Their method is more general, as they cover a wide range of first-order logic rules, whereas we only discuss implications.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Lifted
rule injection beyond implications will be studied in future research contributions.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, albeit less general, our model has a number of clear advantages:
Scalability – Our proposed model of lifted rule injection scales according to the number of implication rules, instead of the number of rules times the number of observed facts for every relation present in a rule.
",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Generalizability – Injected implications will hold even for facts not seen during training, because their validity only depends on the order relation imposed on the relation representations.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This is not guaranteed when training on rules grounded in training facts by Rocktäschel et al. (2015).
",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Training Flexibility – Our method can be trained with various loss functions, including the rank-based loss as used in Riedel et al. (2013).",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This was not possible for the model of Rocktäschel et al. (2015) and already leads to an improved accuracy as seen from the zero-shot learning experiment in §5.2.
",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
Independence Assumption –,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In Rocktäschel et al. (2015) an implication of the form ap ⇒ aq for two ground atoms ap and aq is modeled by the logical equivalence ¬(ap ∧ ¬aq), and its probability is approximated in terms of the elementary probabilities π(ap) and π(aq) as 1 − π(ap) ( 1 − π(aq) ) .",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This assumes the independence of the two atoms ap and aq, which may not hold in practice.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
Our approach does not rely on that assumption and also works for cases of statistical dependence.,4 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, the independence assumption does not hold in the trivial case where the relations rp and rq in the two atoms are equivalent, whereas in our model, the constraints rp ≤ rq and rp ≥ rq would simply reduce to rp = rq.",4 Related Work,[0],[0]
We now present our experimental results.,5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
We start by describing the experimental setup and hyperparameters.,5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"Before turning to the injection of rules, we compare model F with model FS, and show that restricting the tuple embedding space has a regularization effect, rather than limiting the expressiveness of the model (§5.1).",5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"We then demonstrate that model FSL is capable of zero-shot learning (§5.2), and show that injecting high-quality WordNet rules
leads to an improved precision (§5.3).",5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"We proceed with a visual illustration of the relation embeddings with and without injected rules (§5.4), provide details on time efficiency of the lifted rule injection method (§5.5), and show that it correctly captures the asymmetry of implication rules (§5.6).
",5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"All models were implemented in TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015).",5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"We use the hyperparameters of Riedel et al. (2013), with k = 100 hidden dimensions and a weight of α = 0.01 for the L2 regularization loss.",5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"We use ADAM (Kingma and Ba, 2014) for optimization with an initial learning rate of 0.005 and a mini-batch size of 8192.",5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"The embeddings are initialized by sampling uniformly from [−0.1, 0.1] and we use β̃ = 0.1 for the implication loss throughout our experiments.",5 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"Before incorporating external commonsense knowledge into relation representations, we were curious how much we lose by restricting the entity-tuple space to approximately Boolean embeddings.",5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
We evaluate our models on the New York Times dataset introduced by Riedel et al. (2013).,5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
"Surprisingly, we find that the expressiveness of the model does not
suffer from this strong restriction.",5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
"From Table 1 we see that restricting the tuple-embedding space seems to perform slightly better (FS) as opposed to a realvalued tuple-embedding space (F), suggesting that this restriction has a regularization effect that improves generalization.",5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
We also provide the original results for model F by Riedel et al. (2013) (denoted as R13-F) for comparison.,5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
"Due to a different implementation and optimization procedure, the results for our model F and R13-F are not identical.
",5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
Inspecting the top relations for a sampled dimension in the embedding space reveals that the relation space of model FS more closely resembles clusters than that of model F (Table 2).,5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
"We hypothesize that this might be caused by approximately Boolean entity-tuple representations in model FS, resulting in attribute-like entity-tuple vectors that capture which relation clusters they belong to.",5.1 Restricted Embedding Space,[0],[0]
"The zero-shot learning experiment performed in Rocktäschel et al. (2015) leads to an important finding: when injecting implications with right-hand sides for Freebase relations for which no or very limited training facts are available, the model should be able to infer the validity of Freebase facts for those relations based on rules and correlations between textual surface patterns.
",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"We inject the same hand-picked relations as used by Rocktäschel et al. (2015), after removing all Freebase training facts.",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"The lifted rule injection (model FSL) reaches a weighted MAP of 0.35, comparable with 0.38 by the Joint model from Rocktäschel et al. (2015) (denoted R15-Joint).",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"Note that for this experiment we initialized the Freebase relations implied by the rules with negative random vectors (sampled uniformly from [−7.9,−8.1]).",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"The reason is that without any negative training facts for these relations, their components can only go up due to the implication loss, and we do not want to get values that are too high before optimization.
",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
Figure 1 shows how the relation extraction performance improves when more Freebase relation training facts are added.,5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"It effictively measures how well the proposed models, matrix factorization (F), propositionalized rule injection (R15-Joint), and our model (FSL), can make use of the provided rules and correlations between textual surface form pat-
terns and increased fractions of Freebase training facts.",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"Although FSL starts at a lower performance than R15-Joint when no Freebase training facts are present, it outperforms R15-Joint and a plain matrix factorization model by a substantial margin when provided with more than 7.5% of Freebase training facts.",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"This indicates that, in addition to being much faster than R15-Joint, it can make better use of provided rules and few training facts.",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
We attribute this to the Bayesian personalized ranking loss instead of the logistic loss used in Rocktäschel et al. (2015).,5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"The former is compatible with our ruleinjection method, but not with the approach of maximizing the expectation of propositional rules used by R15-Joint.",5.2 Zero-shot Learning,[0],[0]
"The main purpose of this work is to be able to incorporate rules from external resources for aid-
ing relation extraction.",5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
We use WordNet hypernyms to generate rules for the NYT dataset.,5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
To this end we iterate over all surface form patterns in the dataset and attempt to replace words in the pattern by their hypernyms.,5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
"If the resulting pattern is contained in the dataset, we generate the corresponding rule.",5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
"For instance, we generate a rule appos->diplomat->amod ⇒ appos->official->amod since both patterns are contained in the NYT dataset and we know from WordNet that a diplomat is an official.",5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
This leads to 427 rules from WordNet that we subsequently annotate manually to obtain 36 high-quality rules.,5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
Note that none of these rules directly imply a Freebase relation.,5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
"Although the test relations all originate from Freebase, we still hope to see improvements by transitive effects, i.e., better surface form representations that in turn help to predict Freebase facts.
",5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
We show results obtained by injecting these WordNet rules in Table 1 (column FSL).,5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
"The weighted MAP measure increases by 2% with respect to model FS, and 4% compared to our reimplementation of the matrix factorization model F. This demonstrates that imposing a partial ordering based on implication rules can be used to incorporate logical commonsense knowledge and increase the quality of information extraction systems.",5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
"Note that our evaluation setting guarantees that only indirect effects of the rules are measured, i.e., we do not use any rules directly implying test relations.",5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
This shows that injecting such rules influences the relation embedding space beyond only the relations explicitly stated in the rules.,5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
"For example, injecting the rule appos<-father->appos ⇒ poss<-parent->appos can contribute to improved predictions for the test relation parent/child.",5.3 Injecting Knowledge from WordNet,[0],[0]
We provide a visual inspection of how the structure of the relation embedding space changes when rules are imposed.,5.4 Visualizing Relation Embeddings,[0],[0]
"We select all relations involved in the WordNet rules, and gather them as columns in a single matrix, sorted by increasing `1 norm (values in the 100 dimensions are similarly sorted).",5.4 Visualizing Relation Embeddings,[0],[0]
Figures 2a and 2b show the difference between model F (without injected rules) and FSL (with rules).,5.4 Visualizing Relation Embeddings,[0],[0]
"The values of the embeddings in model FSL are more polarized, i.e., we observe stronger negative or positive components than for model F. Furthermore, FSL also reveals a clearer difference between the leftmost (mostly negative, more specific) and right-most (predominantly positive, more general) embeddings (i.e., a clearer separation between positive and negative values in the plot), which results from imposing the order relation in eq.",5.4 Visualizing Relation Embeddings,[0],[0]
(11) when injecting implications.,5.4 Visualizing Relation Embeddings,[0],[0]
"In order to get an idea of the time efficiency of injecting rules, we measure the time per epoch when restricting the program execution to a single 2.4GHz CPU core.",5.5 Efficiency of Lifted Injection of Rules,[0],[0]
"We measure on average 6.33s per epoch without rules (model FS), against 6.76s and 6.97s
when injecting the 36 high-quality WordNet rules and the unfiltered 427 rules (model FSL), respectively.",5.5 Efficiency of Lifted Injection of Rules,[0],[0]
"Increasing the amount of injected rules from 36 to 427 leads to an increase of only 3% in computation time, even though in our setup all rule losses are used in every training batch.",5.5 Efficiency of Lifted Injection of Rules,[0],[0]
This confirms the high efficiency of our lifted rule injection method.,5.5 Efficiency of Lifted Injection of Rules,[0],[0]
"In order to demonstrate that injecting implications conserves their asymmetric nature, we perform the following experiment.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"After incorporating highquality Wordnet rules rp ⇒ rq into model FSL we select all of the tuples tp that occur with relation rp in a training fact 〈rp, tp〉.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"Matching these with relation rq should result in high values for the scores r>q tp, if the implication holds.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"If however the tuples tq are selected from the training facts 〈rq, tq〉, and matched with relation rp, the scores r>p tq should be much lower if the inverse implication does not hold (in other words, if rq and rp are not equivalent).",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"Table 3 lists the averaged results for 5 example rules, and the average over all relations in WordNet rules, both for the case with injected rules (model FSL), and without rules (model FS).",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"For easier comparison, the scores are mapped to the unit interval via the sigmoid function.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"This quantity σ(r>t) is often interpreted as the probability that the corresponding fact holds (Riedel et al., 2013), but because of the BPR-based training, only differences between scores play a role here.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"After injecting rules, the average scores of facts inferred by these rules (i.e., column σ(r>q tp) for model FSL) are always higher than for facts (incorrectly) inferred by the inverse rules (column σ(r>p tq) for model FSL).",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"In the fourth example, the inverse rule leads to high scores as well (on average 0.79, vs. 0.98 for the actual rule).",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"This is due to the fact that the daily and newspaper relations are more or less equivalent, such that the components of rp are not much below those of rq.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"For the last example (the ambassador ⇒ diplomat rule), the asymmetry in the implication is maintained, although the absolute scores are rather low for these two relations.
",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
The results for model FS reflect how strongly the implications in either direction are latently present in the training data.,5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"We can only conclude that model FS manages to capture the similarity be-
tween relations, but not the asymmetric character of implications.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"For example, purely based on the training data, it appears to be more likely that the parent relation implies the father relation, than vice versa.",5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
This again demonstrates the importance and added value of injecting external rules capturing commonsense knowledge.,5.6 Asymmetric Character of Implications,[0],[0]
"We presented a novel, fast approach for incorporating first-order implication rules into distributed representations of relations.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We termed our approach ‘lifted rule injection’, as it avoids the costly grounding of first-order implication rules and is thus independent of the size of the domain of entities.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"By construction, these rules are satisfied for any observed or unobserved fact.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
The presented approach requires a restriction on the entity-tuple embedding space.,6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"However, experiments on a real-world dataset show that this does not impair the expressiveness of the learned representations.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"On the contrary, it appears to have a beneficial regularization effect.
",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"By incorporating rules generated from WordNet hypernyms, our model improved over a matrix factorization baseline for knowledge base completion.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Especially for domains where annotation is costly and only small amounts of training facts are available, our approach provides a way to leverage external knowledge sources for inferring facts.
",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"In future work, we want to extend the proposed ideas beyond implications towards general firstorder logic rules.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We believe that supporting conjunctions, disjunctions and negations would enable to debug and improve representation learning based knowledge base completion.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we want to integrate these ideas into neural methods beyond matrix factorization approaches.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]

"Variable selection complexity remains small as long as log(d) = Θ(nζ), for some ζ ∈ (0, 1), and approaches the parametric rates as ζ → 0.",3.1. Optimal Minimax Rates,[0],[0]
"The minimax rate will generally be dominated by the complexity of CATE estimation, and will approach the parametric rates only for very smooth response surfaces with small number of relevant dimensions, i.e. d0α0 ∨ d1 α1 → 0.
",3.1. Optimal Minimax Rates,[0],[0]
"The main takeaway from Theorem 1 is that the CATE learning rate is determined by the more “complex” of the surfaces f0 and f1, where complexity is quantified by the sparsity-to-smoothness ratio dw/αw for w ∈ {0, 1}.",3.1. Optimal Minimax Rates,[0],[0]
"Thus, a model would achieve the optimal CATE learning rate only if it selects the correct relevant variables for f0 and f1, and tunes its “hyperparameters” (i.e. smoothness of the prior) to cope with a complexity of d0α0 ∨ d1 α1 .",3.1. Optimal Minimax Rates,[0],[0]
"When d0α0 and d1 α1
are very different (e.g. f0 and f1 have different relevant features), rate-optimal estimation is possible only if the model incorporates such differences in Π(φ̄β0 , φ̄β1).

"Span-based neural constituency parsing (Cross and Huang, 2016; Stern et al., 2017a) has attracted attention due to its high accuracy and extreme simplicity.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Compared with other recent neural constituency parsers (Dyer et al., 2016; Liu and Zhang, 2016; Durrett and Klein, 2015) which use neural networks to model tree structures, the spanbased framework is considerably simpler, only using bidirectional RNNs to model the input sequence and not the output tree.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Because of this factorization, the output space is decomposable
which enables efficient dynamic programming algorithm such as CKY.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But existing span-based parsers suffer from a crucial limitation in terms of search: on the one hand, a greedy span parser (Cross and Huang, 2016) is fast (linear-time) but only explores one single path in the exponentially large search space, and on the other hand, a chartbased span parser (Stern et al., 2017a) performs exact search and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, but in cubic time, which is too slow for longer sentences and for applications that go beyond sentence boundaries such as end-to-end discourse parsing (Hernault et al., 2010; Zhao and Huang, 2017) and integrated sentence boundary detection and parsing (Björkelund et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We propose to combine the merits of both greedy and chart-based approaches and design a linear-time span-based neural parser that searches over exponentially large space.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Following Huang and Sagae (2010), we perform left-to-right dynamic programming in an action-synchronous style, with (2n − 1) actions (i.e., steps) for a sentence of nwords.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While previous non-neural work in this area requires sophisticated features (Huang and Sagae, 2010; Mi and Huang, 2015) and thus high time complexity such as O(n11), our states are as simple as ` : (i, j) where ` is the step index and (i, j) is the span, modeled using bidirectional RNNs without any syntactic features.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This gives a running time ofO(n4), with the extraO(n) for step index.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We further employ beam search to have a practical runtime of O(nb2) at the cost of exact search where b is the beam size.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, on the Penn Treebank, most sentences are less than 40 words (n < 40), and even with a small beam size of b = 10, the observed complexity of an O(nb2) parser is not exactly linear in n (see Experiments).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To solve this problem, we apply cube pruning (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007) to improve the runtime toO(nb log b) which
renders an observed complexity that is linear in n (with minor extra inexactness).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We make the following contributions:
• We design the first neural parser that is both linear time and capable of searching over exponentially large space.1
•",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We are the first to apply cube pruning to incremental parsing, and achieves, for the first time, the complexity of O(nb log b), i.e., linear in sentence length and (almost) linear in beam size.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This leads to an observed complexity strictly linear in sentence length n.

"After each shift/reduce action, the top-most span is labeled as either a constituent or with a null label ∅, which means that the subsequence is not a subtree in the final decoded parse.",2.1 Span-Based Shift-Reduce Parsing,[0],[0]

"This eliminates the need for complex feature engineering, and can be stored for efficient querying during decoding.",2.2 Bi-LSTM features,[0],[0]

= ∑
(i,j)∈t

Note that X is a nonterminal label, a unary chain (e.g., S-VP), or null label ∅.2 In a shift-reduce setting, there are 2n − 1 steps (n shifts and n − 1 reduces) and after each step we take the best label for the resulting span; therefore there are exactly

2n−1 such (labeled) spans (i, j,X) in tree t. Also note that the choice of the label for any span (i, j) is only dependent on (i, j) itself (and not depending on any subtree information), thus the max over label X is independent of other spans, which is a nice property of span-based parsing (Cross and Huang, 2016; Stern et al., 2017a).",3.1 Score Decomposition,[0],[0]

"This problem can be solved by graph-structure stack (Tomita, 1991; Huang and Sagae, 2010), which maintains, for each state p, a set of predecessor states π(p) that p can combine with on the left.

The incremental nature of our parser allows us to further lower the runtime complexity at the cost of inexact search.,3.3 Action-Synchronous Beam Search,[0],[0]
"At each time step, we maintain the top b parsing states, pruning off the rest.",3.3 Action-Synchronous Beam Search,[0],[0]
"Thus, a candidate parse that made it to the end of decoding had to survive within the top b at every step.

"However, beam search becomes very tricky.
",3.3 Action-Synchronous Beam Search,[0],[0]
With O(n) parsing actions our time complexity becomes linear in the length of the sentence.,3.3 Action-Synchronous Beam Search,[0],[0]
"However, Theorem 1 suggests that a parsing state p can have up to b predecessor states (“left pointers”), i.e., |π(p)| ≤ b because π(p) are all in the same step, a reduce action can produce up to b subsequent new reduced states.",3.4 Cube Pruning,[0],[0]
"With b items on a beam and O(n) actions to take, this gives us an overall complexity of O(nb2).",3.4 Cube Pruning,[0],[0]
"Even though b2 is a constant, even modest values of b can make b2 dominate the length of the sentence.",3.4 Cube Pruning,[0],[0]
"4
To improve this at the cost of additional inexactness, we introduce cube pruning to our beam search, where we put candidate actions into a heap and retrieve the top b states to be considered in the next time-step.",3.4 Cube Pruning,[0],[0]
We heapify the top b shiftmerged states and the top b reduced states.,3.4 Cube Pruning,[0],[0]
"To avoid inserting all b2 reduced states from the previous beam, we only consider each state’s highest scoring left pointer,5 and whenever we pop a reduced state from the heap, we iterate down its left pointers to insert the next non-duplicate reduced state back into the heap.",3.4 Cube Pruning,[0],[0]
This process finishes when we pop b items from the heap.,3.4 Cube Pruning,[0],[0]

"Recently, span-based constituency parsing has achieved competitive accuracies with extremely simple models by using bidirectional RNNs to model “spans”.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"However, the minimal span parser of Stern et al.

"Previous work has presented the results of classification experiments using linguistic features, attempting to identify which features contribute most to classification accuracy.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, studies often do not include an empirical analysis of features.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

set (e.g. LIWC categories) is useful for deception classification, but we lack insight about the nature of the deceptive and truthful language that makes the feature set useful, and whether the differences in language use are statistically significant.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
In this work we conduct an empirical analysis of feature sets and report on the different characteristics of truthful and deceptive language.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

Language-based cues to deception have been analyzed in many genres.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Ott et al. (2011) compared approaches to automatically detecting deceptive opinion spam, using a crowdsourced dataset of fake hotel reviews.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Several studies use a fake opinion paradigm for collecting data, instructing subjects to write or record deceptive and truthful opinions about controversial topics such as the death penalty or abortion, or about a person that they like/dislike (Newman et al., 2003; Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Other research has focused on real-world data obtained from court testimonies and depositions (Fornaciari and Poesio, 2013; Bachenko et al., 2008; Pérez-Rosas et al., 2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Real-world deceptive situations are highstakes, where there is much to be gained or lost if deception succeeds or fails; it is hypothesized that these conditions are more likely to elicit strong cues to deception.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, working with such data requires extensive research to annotate each utterance for veracity, so such datasets are often quite small and not always reliable.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Linguistic features such as n-grams and language complexity have been analyzed as cues to deception (Pérez-Rosas and Mihalcea, 2015; Yancheva and Rudzicz, 2013).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Syntactic features such as part of speech tags have also been found to be useful for structured data (Ott et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2012).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Statement Analysis (Adams, 1996) is a text-based deception detection approach that combines lexical and syntactic features.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"An especially useful resource for text-based deception detection is the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker and King, 1999), which groups words into psychologically motivated categories.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In addition to lexical features, some studies have examined acousticprosodic cues to deception (Rockwell et al., 1997; Enos, 2009; Mendels et al., 2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"(Benus et al., 2006) studied pause behavior in deceptive speech.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This work is very promising, but it is more difficult to obtain large, cleanly recorded speech corpora with deception annotations than to obtain text corpora.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"An excellent meta-study of verbal cues to deception can be found in (DePaulo et al., 2003).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For this work, we examined the Columbia XCultural Deception (CXD) Corpus (Levitan et al., 2015a) a collection of within-subject deceptive and non-deceptive speech from native speakers of Standard American English (SAE) and Mandarin Chinese (MC), all speaking in English.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
The corpus contains dialogues between 340 subjects.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
A variation of a fake resume paradigm was used to collect the data.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
Previously unacquainted pairs of subjects played a ”lying game” with each other.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
Each subject filled out a 24-item biographical questionnaire and were instructed to create false answers for a random half of the questions.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"They also reported demographic information including gender and native language, and completed the NEO-FFI personality inventory (Costa and McCrae, 1989).
",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
The lying game was recorded in a sound booth.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"For the first half of the game, one subject assumed the role of the interviewer, while the other answered the biographical questions, lying for half and telling the truth for the other; questions chosen in each category were balanced across the corpus.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"For the second half of the game, the subjects roles were reversed, and the interviewer became the interviewee.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"During the game, the interviewer was allowed to ask the 24 questions in any order s/he chose; the interviewer was also encouraged to ask follow-up questions to aid them in determining the truth of the interviewees answers.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"Interviewers recorded their judgments for each of the 24 questions, providing information about human perception of deception.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"The entire corpus was orthographically transcribed using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)1 crowd-sourcing platform, and the speech was segmented into inter-pausal units (IPUs), defined as pause-free segments of speech separated by a minimum pause length of 50 ms.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"The speech was also segmented into turn units, where a turn is defined as a maximal sequence of IPUs from a single speaker without any interlocutor speech that is not a backchannel.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
There are two forms of deception annotations in the corpus: local and global.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
Interviewees labeled their responses with local annotations by pressing a ”T” or ”F” key for each utterance as they spoke.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
These keypresses were automatically aligned with speaker IPUs and turns.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"Global la-

Consider the following dialogue:,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
Interviewer: What is your mother’s job?,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
Interviewee:,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
My mother is a doctor (F).,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"She has always worked very late hours and I felt neglected as a child (T).
",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
Is the interviewee response true or false?,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
We differentiate between global and local deception.,3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"Globally, the response to the question is deceptive.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"However, it contains local instances of both truth and deception.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"In this work we focus on dialoguebased deception, using global deception labels.",3.1 Corpus,[0],[0]
"Previous work with the CXD corpus has focused on IPU-level and turn-level analysis and classification of local deception, mostly with acousticprosodic features (Levitan et al., 2015b; Mendels et al., 2017).",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
Here we are interested in exploring global deception at the dialogue-level for the first time in this corpus.,3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
We define response-segments as sets of turns that are related to a single question (of the 24 interview questions).,3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"In order to annotate these segments, we first used a question detection and identification system (Maredia et al., 2017) that uses word embeddings to match semantically similar variations of questions to a target question list.",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
This was necessary because interviewers asked the 24 questions using different wording from the original list of questions.,3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"On this corpus, (Maredia et al., 2017) obtained an F1score of .95%.
",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"After tagging interviewer turns with this system, we labeled the set of interviewee turns between two interviewer questions q1 and q2 as corresponding to question q1.",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"The intuition behind this was that those turns were responses to follow up questions related to q1, and while the question detection and identification system discussed above did not identify follow up questions, we found that most of the follow up questions after an interviewer question q1 would be related to q1 in our hand annotation.",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"We evaluated this global segmentation on a hand-annotated test set of 17 interviews (about 10% of the corpus) consisting of 2,671 interviewee turns, 408 interviewer questions, and 977 follow up questions.",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"Our global segmentation approach resulted in 77.8% accuracy on our hand-labeled test set (errors were mostly
due to turns that were unrelated to any question).",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"We performed our analysis and classification on two segmentations of the data using this tagging method: (1) first turn: we analyzed only the single interviewee turn directly following the original question, and (2) multiple turns we analyzed the entire segment of interviewee turns that were responding to the original interviewer question and subsequent follow-up questions.",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"In our classification experiments, we explore whether a deceptive answer is be better classified by the interviewee’s initial response or by all of the follow-up conversation between interviewer and interviewee.",3.2 Global Segmentation,[0],[0]
"LIWC Previous work has found that deceivers tend to use different word usage patterns when they are lying (Newman et al., 2003).",4 Features,[0],[0]
"We used LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) to extract semantic features from each utterance.",4 Features,[0],[0]
LIWC is a text analysis program that computes features consisting of normalized word counts for 93 semantic classes.,4 Features,[0],[0]
"LIWC dimensions have been used in many studies to predict outcomes including personality (Pennebaker and King, 1999), deception (Newman et al., 2003), and health (Pennebaker et al., 1997).",4 Features,[0],[0]
"We extracted a total of 93 features using LIWC 2015 2, including standard linguistic dimensions (e.g. percentage of words that are pronouns, articles), markers of psychological processes (e.g. affect, social, cognitive), punctuation categories (e.g periods, commas), and formality measures (e.g. fillers, swear words).",4 Features,[0],[0]
"Linguistic We extracted 23 linguistic features 3 which we adopted from previous deception studies such as (Enos, 2009; Bachenko et al., 2008).",4 Features,[0],[0]
"Included in this list are binary and numeric features capturing hedge words, filled pauses, laughter, complexity, contractions, and denials.",4 Features,[0],[0]
"We include Dictionary of Affect Language (DAL) (Whissell et al., 1986) scores that measure the emotional meaning of texts, and a specificity score which measures level of detail (Li and Nenkova, 2015).",4 Features,[0],[0]
"The full list of features is: ’hasAbsolutelyReally’, ’hasContraction’, ’hasI’, ’hasWe’, ’hasYes’, ’hasNAposT’ (turns

"Response Length Previous work has found that response length, in seconds, is shorter in deceptive speech, and that the difference in number of words in a segment of speech is insignificant between deceptive and truthful speech (DePaulo et al., 2003).",4 Features,[0],[0]
"For our question-level analysis, we used four different measures for response length: the total number of seconds of an interviewee responsesegment, the total number of words in an interviewee response-segment, the average response time of a turn in an interviewee response-segment, and the average number of words per turn in an interviewee response-segment.",4 Features,[0],[0]
Individual Traits,4 Features,[0],[0]
We analyzed gender and native language of the speakers to determine if these traits were related to ability to deceive and to detect deception.,4 Features,[0],[0]
"We also analyzed linguistic cues to deception across gender and native language, and used gender and native language information in our classification experiments.",4 Features,[0],[0]
"All speakers were either male or female, and their native language was either Standard American English or Mandarin Chinese.",4 Features,[0],[0]
"In addition, we used the NEO-FFI (5 factor) personality inventory scores as features in classification experiments, but not for the statistical analysis in this paper.",4 Features,[0],[0]
Follow-up Questions Follow-up questions are questions that an interviewer asks after they ask a question from the original prescribed set of questions.,4 Features,[0],[0]
"We hypothesized that if an interviewer asked more follow-up questions, they were more likely to identify deceptive responses, because asking follow-up questions indicated interviewer doubt of the interviewee’s truthfulness.",4 Features,[0],[0]
"For each interviewee response-segment, we counted the number of follow-up questions interviewees were asked by the interviewer.",4 Features,[0],[0]
"In order to analyze the differences between deceptive and truthful speech, we extracted the above features from each question response-segment,
and calculated a series of paired t-tests between the features of truthful speech and deceptive speech.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
All tests for significance correct for family-wise Type I error by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at α = 0.05.,5 Analysis,[0],[0]

Table 1 shows the features that were statistically significant indicators of truth and deception in interviewee response-segments consisting of multiple turns.,5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Below, we highlight some interesting findings.
",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"In contrast to (DePaulo et al., 2003), we found that the total duration of an interviewee responsesegment was longer for deceptive speech than for truthful speech.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Additionally, while (DePaulo et al., 2003) showed that the number of words in a segment of speech was not significantly different between deceptive and truthful speech, we found that deceptive response-segments had more words than truthful response-segments.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we found that longer average response time per turn and more words per sentence were significant indicators of deception.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"These results show that when interviewees are trying to deceive, not only is their aggregate response longer in duration and number of words, but their individual responses to each follow-up question are also longer.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Consistent with (DePaulo et al., 2003), we found that more filled pauses in an interviewee responsesegment was a significant indicator of deception.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Deceivers are hypothesized to experience an increase in cognitive load (Vrij et al., 1996), and this can result in difficulties in speech planning, which can be signaled by filled pauses.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Although (Benus et al., 2006) found that, in general, the use of pauses correlates more with truthful than with deceptive speech, we found that filled pauses such as ”um” were correlated with deceptive speech.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"The LIWC cogproc (cognitive processes) dimension, which includes words such as ”cause”, ”know”, ”ought” was significantly more frequent in truthful speech, also supporting the theory that cognitive load is increased while practicing deception.
",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"We found that increased DALimagery scores, which compute words often used in speech to create vivid descriptions, were indicators of deception.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"We also found that the LIWC language summary variables of authenticity and adjectives
were indicators of deception: in an effort to sound more truthful and authentic, interviewees may have provided a level of detail that is uncharacteristic of truthful speech.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Similarly, the specificity metric was indicative of deception: deceptive responses contained more detailed language.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Words in the LIWC clout category - a category describing words that indicate power of influence - were more prevalent in deceptive responses, suggesting that subjects sounded more confident while lying.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
Interrogatives were an indicator of deception.,5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"In the context of the interviewerinterviewee paradigm, these are interviewee questions to the interviewer.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Perhaps this was a technique used to stall so that they had more time to
develop an answer (e.g. ”Can you repeat the question?”), or to deflect the interviewer’s attention from their deception and put the interviewer on the spot.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"We observed that hedge words and phrases, which speakers use to distance themselves from a proposition, were more frequent in deceptive speech.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"This is consistent with Statement Analysis (Adams, 1996), which posits that hedge words are used in deceptive statements to intentionally create vagueness that obscures facts.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"Consistent with this finding, certainty in language (words such as ”always” or ”never”) was a strong indicator of truthfulness.
",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"It is also interesting to note the features that were not significant indicators of truth or decep-
tion.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"For example, there was no significant difference in laughter frequency or apostrophes (used for contractions in this corpus) between truthful and deceptive responses.
",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"When we compared indicators of truth vs. deception across multiple turns to indicators of truth vs. deception in just the first turns of interviewee response-segments, we found that, generally, indicators in first turns are a subset of indicators across multiple turns.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
In some cases there were interesting differences.,5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"For example, although tone (emotional tone - higher numbers indicate more positive, and lower indicate negative) was not a significant indicator of deception for the entire interviewee response-segment, negative tone was a moderate indicator of deception in first turns.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"This suggests that the tone of interviewees, when they have just started their lie, is different from when they are given the opportunity to expand on that lie.",5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
The findings from our analysis of first turns suggest that there might be enough information in the first response alone to distinguish between deceptive and truthful speech; we test this in our classification experiments in Section 6.,5.1 Interviewee Responses,[0],[0]
"In addition to analyzing the linguistic differences between truthful and deceptive speech, we were interested in studying the characteristics of speech that is believed or disbelieved.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"Since the CXD corpus includes interviewer judgments of deception for each question asked, we have the unique opportunity to study human perception of deception on a large scale.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows the features that were statistically significant indicators of truth and deception in interviewee responses - consisting of multiple turns - that were perceived as true or false by interviewers.,5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
Here we highlight some interesting findings.,5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"There were many features that were prevalent in speech that interviewers perceived as deceptive, which were in fact cues to deception.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"For example, speech containing more words in a response-segment and more words per sentence was generally perceived as deceptive by interviewers, and indeed, this perception was correct.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"Disbelieved answers had a greater frequency of filled pauses and hedge words, and greater specificity, all of which were increased in deceptive speech.
",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"There were also several features that were indicators of deception, but were not found in higher rates in statements that were perceived
as false.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"For example, the LIWC dimensions clout and certain were not significantly different in believed vs. disbelieved interviewee responses, but clout was increased in deceptive speech and certain language was increased in truthful speech.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"There were also features that were significantly different between believed and disbelieved statements, but were not indicators of deception.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"For example, statements that were perceived as false by interviewers had a greater proportion of specificDenials (e.g. ”I did not”) than those that were perceived as true; this was not a valid cue to deception.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
Number of turns was increased in dialogue segments where the interviewer did not ultimately believe the interviewee response.,5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"That is, more follow up questions were asked when an interviewer did not believe their interlocutor’s response, which is an intuitive behavior.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"When we compared indicators of speech that was perceived as deceptive across multiple turns to indicators of speech that was perceived as deceptive in just the first turns, we found that, generally, indicators in first turns are a subset of indicators across multiple turns.
",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"On average, human accuracy at judging truth and deception in the CXD corpus was 56.75%, and accuracy at judging deceptive statements only was 47.93%.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
The average F1-score for humans was 46.,5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"Thus, although some cues were correctly perceived by interviewers, humans were generally poor at deception perception.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"Nonetheless, characterizing the nature of speech that is believed or not believed is useful for applications where we would ultimately like to synthesize speech that is trustworthy.",5.2 Interviewer Judgments of Deception,[0],[0]
"Having discovered many differences between deceptive and truthful language across all speakers, we were interested in analyzing differences in deceptive language across groups of speakers.",5.3 Gender and Native Language Differences in Deception Behavior,[0],[0]
"Using gender and native language (English or Mandarin Chinese) as group traits, we conducted two types of analysis.",5.3 Gender and Native Language Differences in Deception Behavior,[0],[0]
"First, we directly compared deception performance measures (ability to deceive as interviewee, and ability to detect deception as interviewer) between speakers with different traits, to assess the effect of individual characteristics on deception abilities.",5.3 Gender and Native Language Differences in Deception Behavior,[0],[0]
"In addition, we compared the features of deceptive and truthful language in sub-
sets of the corpus, considering only people with a particular trait, in order to determine groupspecific patterns of deceptive language.",5.3 Gender and Native Language Differences in Deception Behavior,[0],[0]
"As before, tests for significance correct for family-wise Type I error by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at α = 0.05.",5.3 Gender and Native Language Differences in Deception Behavior,[0],[0]
The kth smallest p value is considered significant if it is less than k∗αn .,5.3 Gender and Native Language Differences in Deception Behavior,[0],[0]
There were no significant differences in deception ability between male and female speakers.,5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"However, there were many differences in language between male and female speakers.",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"Further, some features were only discriminative between deception and truth for a specific gender.",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"Table 3 shows linguistic features that were significantly different between truthful and deceptive speech, but only for one gender.",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"In some cases the feature was found in different proportions in male and females, and in other cases there was no significant difference.",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"For example, family words were indicative of deception only in female speakers, and these words were also used more frequently by female speakers than male speakers.
",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"The LIWC category of compare was also indicative of deception for females only, and this feature was generally found more frequently in female speech.",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"Article usage was only significantly different between truthful and deceptive speech in females (more articles were found in deceptive speech), but articles were used more frequently in male speech.",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the LIWC category of posemo (positive emotion) was increased in truthful speech for male speakers only, and there
was no significant difference of posemo frequency across gender.",5.3.1 Gender,[0],[0]
"Interviewees were more successful at deceiving native Chinese speakers than at deceiving native English speakers (t(170) = −2.13, p = 0.033).",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"This was true regardless of interviewee gender and native language, and slightly stronger for female interviewers (t(170) = −2.22, p = 0.027).",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"When considering only female interviewers, interviewees were more successful at deceiving nonnative speakers than native speakers, but this difference was not significant when considering only male interviewers.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"As with gender, there were several features that were discriminative between deception and truth for only native speakers of English, or only native speakers of Mandarin.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"Table 3 shows LIWC categories and their relation to deception, broken down by native language.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"For example, power words were found more frequently in deception statements, when considering native English speakers only.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"In general, power words were used more by native Mandarin speakers than by native English speakers.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"LIWC categories of compare, relative, and swear were more prevalent in deceptive speech, only for English speakers.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, feel and perception dimensions were only indicators of deception for native Mandarin speakers, although there was no significant difference in the use of these word categories across native language.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"Informal and netspeak word dimensions tended to be more frequent in truthful speech for native Chinese speakers only (approaching significance), and these word categories were generally more frequent in native Mandarin speech.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"Finally, filler words tended to be more frequent in deceptive speech (approaching significance) only for native Mandarin speakers, and these were used more frequently by native Mandarin speakers than native English speakers.
",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]
"Overall, our findings suggest that deceptive behavior in general, and deceptive language in particular, are affected by a person’s individual characteristics, including gender and native language.",5.3.2 Native Language,[0],[0]

"Semantic role labeling (SRL) extracts a high-level representation of meaning from a sentence, labeling e.g. who did what to whom.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Explicit representations of such semantic information have been
shown to improve results in challenging downstream tasks such as dialog systems (Tur et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2013), machine reading (Berant et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015) and translation (Liu and Gildea, 2010; Bazrafshan and Gildea, 2013).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Though syntax was long considered an obvious prerequisite for SRL systems (Levin, 1993; Punyakanok et al., 2008), recently deep neural network architectures have surpassed syntacticallyinformed models (Zhou and Xu, 2015; Marcheggiani et al., 2017; He et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018; He et al., 2018), achieving state-of-the art SRL performance with no explicit modeling of syntax.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An additional benefit of these end-to-end models is that they require just raw tokens and (usually) detected predicates as input, whereas richer linguistic features typically require extraction by an auxiliary pipeline of models.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Still, recent work (Roth and Lapata, 2016; He et al., 2017; Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017) indicates that neural network models could see even higher accuracy gains by leveraging syntactic information rather than ignoring it.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"He et al. (2017) indicate that many of the errors made by a syntaxfree neural network on SRL are tied to certain syntactic confusions such as prepositional phrase attachment, and show that while constrained inference using a relatively low-accuracy predicted parse can provide small improvements in SRL accuracy, providing a gold-quality parse leads to substantial gains.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Marcheggiani and Titov (2017) incorporate syntax from a high-quality parser (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016) using graph convolutional neural networks (Kipf and Welling, 2017), but like He et al. (2017) they attain only small increases over a model with no syntactic parse, and even perform worse than a syntax-free model on out-of-domain data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These works suggest that though syntax has the potential to improve neural network SRL models, we have not
yet designed an architecture which maximizes the benefits of auxiliary syntactic information.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In response, we propose linguistically-informed self-attention (LISA): a model that combines multi-task learning (Caruana, 1993) with stacked layers of multi-head self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017); the model is trained to: (1) jointly predict parts of speech and predicates; (2) perform parsing; and (3) attend to syntactic parse parents, while (4) assigning semantic role labels.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Whereas prior work typically requires separate models to provide linguistic analysis, including most syntaxfree neural models which still rely on external predicate detection, our model is truly end-to-end: earlier layers are trained to predict prerequisite parts-of-speech and predicates, the latter of which are supplied to later layers for scoring.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Though prior work re-encodes each sentence to predict each desired task and again with respect to each predicate to perform SRL, we more efficiently encode each sentence only once, predict its predicates, part-of-speech tags and labeled syntactic parse, then predict the semantic roles for all predicates in the sentence in parallel.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The model is trained such that, as syntactic parsing models improve, providing high-quality parses at test time will improve its performance, allowing the model to leverage updated parsing models without requiring re-training.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
In experiments on the CoNLL-2005 and CoNLL-2012 datasets we show that our linguistically-informed models out-perform the syntax-free state-of-the-art.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On CoNLL-2005 with predicted predicates and standard word embeddings, our single model out-performs the previous state-of-the-art model on the WSJ test set by 2.5 F1 points absolute.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the challenging out-of-domain Brown test set, our model improves substantially over the previous state-of-the-art by more than 3.5 F1, a nearly 10% reduction in error.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On CoNLL-2012, our model gains more than 2.5 F1 absolute over the previous state-of-the-art.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our models also show improvements when using contextually-encoded word representations (Peters et al., 2018), obtaining nearly 1.0 F1 higher than the state-of-the-art on CoNLL-2005 news and more than 2.0 F1 improvement on out-of-domain text.1

LISA,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our goal is to design an efficient neural network model which makes use of linguistic information as effectively as possible in order to perform endto-end SRL.,2 Model,[0],[0]
"LISA achieves this by combining: (1) A new technique of supervising neural attention to predict syntactic dependencies with (2) multi-task learning across four related tasks.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
Figure 1 depicts the overall architecture of our model.,2 Model,[0],[0]
"The basis for our model is the Transformer encoder introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017): we transform word embeddings into contextually-encoded token representations using stacked multi-head self-attention and feedforward layers (§2.1).
",2 Model,[0],[0]
"To incorporate syntax, one self-attention head is trained to attend to each token’s syntactic parent, allowing the model to use this attention head as an oracle for syntactic dependencies.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"We introduce this syntactically-informed self-attention (Figure 2) in more detail in §2.2.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
Our model is designed for the more realistic setting in which gold predicates are not provided at test-time.,2 Model,[0],[0]
"Our model predicts predicates and integrates part-of-speech (POS) information into earlier layers by re-purposing representations closer to the input to predict predicate and POS tags us-
ing hard parameter sharing (§2.3).",2 Model,[0],[0]
"We simplify optimization and benefit from shared statistical strength derived from highly correlated POS and predicates by treating tagging and predicate detection as a single task, performing multi-class classification into the joint Cartesian product space of POS and predicate labels.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Though typical models, which re-encode the sentence for each predicate, can simplify SRL to token-wise tagging, our joint model requires a different approach to classify roles with respect to each predicate.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Contextually encoded tokens are projected to distinct predicate and role embeddings (§2.4), and each predicted predicate is scored with the sequence’s role representations using a bilinear model (Eqn. 6), producing per-label scores for BIO-encoded semantic role labels for each token and each semantic frame.
",2 Model,[0],[0]
The model is trained end-to-end by maximum likelihood using stochastic gradient descent (§2.5).,2 Model,[0],[0]
"The basis for our model is a multi-head selfattention token encoder, recently shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on SRL (Tan et al., 2018), and which provides a natural mechanism
for incorporating syntax, as described in §2.2.",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"Our implementation replicates Vaswani et al. (2017).
",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
The input to the network is a sequence X of T token representations xt.,2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"In the standard setting these token representations are initialized to pretrained word embeddings, but we also experiment with supplying pre-trained ELMo representations combined with task-specific learned parameters, which have been shown to substantially improve performance of other SRL models (Peters et al., 2018).",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"For experiments with gold predicates, we concatenate a predicate indicator embedding pt following previous work (He et al., 2017).
",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
We project2 these input embeddings to a representation that is the same size as the output of the self-attention layers.,2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"We then add a positional encoding vector computed as a deterministic sinusoidal function of t, since the self-attention has no innate notion of token position.
",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
We feed this token representation as input to a series of J residual multi-head self-attention layers with feed-forward connections.,2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"Denoting the jth self-attention layer as T (j)(·), the output of that layer s(j)t , and LN(·) layer normalization, the following recurrence applied to initial input c(p)t :
s (j) t = LN(s (j 1) t + T (j)(s(j 1)t ))",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"(1)
gives our final token representations s(j)t .",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
Each T (j)(·) consists of: (a) multi-head self-attention and (b) a feed-forward projection.,2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"The multi-head self attention consists of H attention heads, each of which learns a distinct attention function to attend to all of the tokens in the sequence.",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"This self-attention is performed for each token for each head, and the results of the H self-attentions are concatenated to form the final self-attended representation for each token.
",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"Specifically, consider the matrix S(j 1) of T token representations at layer j 1.",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"For each attention head h, we project this matrix into distinct key, value and query representations K(j)h , V (j) h and Q(j)h of dimensions T⇥dk, T⇥dq, and T⇥dv, respectively.",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
We can then multiply Q(j)h by K (j) h to obtain a T ⇥ T matrix of attention weights A(j)h between each pair of tokens in the sentence.,2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"Following Vaswani et al. (2017) we perform scaled dot-product attention: We scale the weights by the inverse square root of their embedding dimension
2All linear projections include bias terms, which we omit in this exposition for the sake of clarity.
and normalize with the softmax function to produce a distinct distribution for each token over all the tokens in the sentence:
A (j) h = softmax(d 0.5 k Q (j) h K (j) h
T ) (2)
",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"These attention weights are then multiplied by V
(j) h for each token to obtain the self-attended to-
ken representations M (j)h :
M (j) h = A (j) h V (j) h (3)
Row t of M (j)h , the self-attended representation for token t at layer j, is thus the weighted sum with respect to t (with weights given by A(j)h ) over the token representations in V (j)h .
",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"The outputs of all attention heads for each token are concatenated, and this representation is passed to the feed-forward layer, which consists of two linear projections each followed by leaky ReLU activations (Maas et al., 2013).",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"We add the output of the feed-forward to the initial representation and apply layer normalization to give the final output of self-attention layer j, as in Eqn. 1.",2.1 Self-attention token encoder,[0],[0]
"Typically, neural attention mechanisms are left on their own to learn to attend to relevant inputs.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"Instead, we propose training the self-attention to attend to specific tokens corresponding to the syntactic structure of the sentence as a mechanism for passing linguistic knowledge to later layers.
",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we replace one attention head with the deep bi-affine model of Dozat and Manning (2017), trained to predict syntactic dependencies.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"Let Aparse be the parse attention weights, at layer i.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
Its input is the matrix of token representations S (i 1).,2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"As with the other attention heads, we project S(i 1) into key, value and query representations, denoted Kparse, Qparse, Vparse.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"Here the key and query projections correspond to parent and dependent representations of the tokens, and we allow their dimensions to differ from the rest of the attention heads to more closely follow the implementation of Dozat and Manning (2017).",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"Unlike the other attention heads which use a dot product to score key-query pairs, we score the compatibility between Kparse and Qparse using a bi-affine operator Uheads to obtain attention weights:
Aparse = softmax(QparseUheadsK T parse) (4)
These attention weights are used to compose a weighted average of the value representations Vparse as in the other attention heads.
",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"We apply auxiliary supervision at this attention head to encourage it to attend to each token’s parent in a syntactic dependency tree, and to encode information about the token’s dependency label.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"Denoting the attention weight from token t to a candidate head q as Aparse[t, q], we model the probability of token t having parent q as:
P (q = head(t) | X ) = Aparse[t, q] (5)
using the attention weights Aparse[t] as the distribution over possible heads for token t.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
We define the root token as having a self-loop.,2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"This attention head thus emits a directed graph3 where each token’s parent is the token to which the attention Aparse assigns the highest weight.
",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"We also predict dependency labels using perclass bi-affine operations between parent and dependent representations Qparse and Kparse to produce per-label scores, with locally normalized probabilities over dependency labels ydept given by the softmax function.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"We refer the reader to Dozat and Manning (2017) for more details.
",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"This attention head now becomes an oracle for syntax, denoted P , providing a dependency parse to downstream layers.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"This model not only predicts its own dependency arcs, but allows for the injection of auxiliary parse information at test time by simply setting Aparse to the parse parents produced by e.g. a state-of-the-art parser.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"In this way, our model can benefit from improved, external parsing models without re-training.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
"Unlike typical multi-task models, ours maintains the ability to leverage external syntactic information.",2.2 Syntactically-informed self-attention,[0],[0]
We also share the parameters of lower layers in our model to predict POS tags and predicates.,2.3 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"Following He et al. (2017), we focus on the end-toend setting, where predicates must be predicted on-the-fly.",2.3 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"Since we also train our model to predict syntactic dependencies, it is beneficial to give the model knowledge of POS information.",2.3 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"While much previous work employs a pipelined approach to both POS tagging for dependency parsing and predicate detection for SRL, we take a multi-task learning (MTL) approach (Caruana,

1993), sharing the parameters of earlier layers in our SRL model with a joint POS and predicate detection objective.",2.3 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"Since POS is a strong predictor of predicates4 and the complexity of training a multi-task model increases with the number of tasks, we combine POS tagging and predicate detection into a joint label space: For each POS tag TAG which is observed co-occurring with a predicate, we add a label of the form TAG:PREDICATE.
",2.3 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we feed the representation s(r)t from a layer r preceding the syntacticallyinformed layer p to a linear classifier to produce per-class scores rt for token t.",2.3 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"We compute locally-normalized probabilities using the softmax function: P (yprpt | X ) / exp(rt), where y prp t is a label in the joint space.",2.3 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
Our final goal is to predict semantic roles for each predicate in the sequence.,2.4 Predicting semantic roles,[0],[0]
"We score each predicate against each token in the sequence using a bilinear operation, producing per-label scores for each token for each predicate, with predicates and syntax determined by oracles V and P .
",2.4 Predicting semantic roles,[0],[0]
"First, we project each token representation s(J)t to a predicate-specific representation spredt and a role-specific representation srolet .",2.4 Predicting semantic roles,[0],[0]
We then provide these representations to a bilinear transformation U for scoring.,2.4 Predicting semantic roles,[0],[0]
"So, the role label scores sft for the token at index t with respect to the predicate at index f (i.e. token t and frame f ) are given by:
sft = (s pred f )",2.4 Predicting semantic roles,[0],[0]
"T Us role t (6)

"Following He et al. (2017), we next apply a series of corrections to model predictions in order to understand which error types the gold parse resolves: e.g. Fix Labels fixes labels on spans matching gold boundaries, and Merge Spans merges adjacent predicted spans into a gold span.6
In Figure 3 we see that much of the performance gap between the gold and predicted parses is due to span boundary errors (Merge Spans, Split Spans and Fix Span Boundary), which supports the hypothesis proposed by He et al. (2017) that incorporating syntax could be particularly helpful for resolving these errors.",4.3 Analysis,[0],[0]

"Bayesian optimization is best known as a black-box global optimizer (Brochu et al., 2010; Shahriari et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"It was shown to be efficient for several function landscapes (Jones, 2001), real world scenarios such as the automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms (Bergstra et al., 2011; Snoek et al., 2012; Feurer et al., 2015) or robotics and control (Lizotte et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2014; Calandra et al., 2016) and several of its variants have convergence guaranties to a global optimum (Vazquez & Bect, 2010; Bull, 2011).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Its efficiency stems from two key principles: a probabilistic modeling of the objective function and a sampling procedure that fully exploits this model.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, as the dimensionality of the task increases, non-stationarity effects of the objective or the noise function (see Shahriari et al. (2016), Sec. V.D. for a discussion of these effects) are exacerbated, rendering the modeling of the objective function challenging.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"An additional difficulty stemming from the increase in dimensionality is the tendency of Bayesian optimization to over-explore, which was experimentally observed in e.g. Brochu et al. (2007).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Several recent approaches trying to scale Bayesian optimization to higher dimensions assume additional structure of the objective function.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Snoek et al. (2014), it is assumed that stationarity of the objective function can be recovered through the use of a parametric family of mappings.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While it is assumed that the objective function has a lower intrinsic dimension in Djolonga et al. (2013); Wang et al. (2016), can be decomposable into a sum of lower dimensional functions in Kandasamy et al. (2015) or a combination of both hypothesis in Li et al. (2016).

"In this paper, we assume prior knowledge on the location of the optimum—given by an initial solution and a confidence on the optimality thereof—and leverage Bayesian optimization in a local manner to improve over this solution.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We are especially interested in the application of our algorithm to the optimization of motor skills since i) evaluating the policy return is expensive on physical systems and will likely dominate the computational budget of the optimization process; as such, sample efficient algorithms such as Bayesian optimization are desirable ii) robotics applications are typically high dimensional and global optimization might be prohibitively expensive iii) an initial solution
can often be obtained through the use of imitation learning (Argall et al., 2009) or by a preliminary optimization on a surrogate model such as a simulator.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our algorithm can be seen as a local stochastic search algorithm akin to Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMAES) (Hansen & Ostermeier, 2001), cross-entropy (Mannor et al., 2003) or MOdel-based Relative Entropy (MORE) (Abdolmaleki et al., 2015).",2. Related work,[0],[0]

"A surrogate function is learned in (Loshchilov et al., 2013) using SVM-Rank, and is optimized using CMA-ES for a few iterations, yielding an update of the search distribution without requiring additional function evaluations.",2. Related work,[0],[0]
"While in MORE (Abdolmaleki et al., 2015), a local quadratic approximation of the objective function yields the new mean and covariance of the Gaussian search distribution upon an information-theoretic update.",2. Related work,[0],[0]
"Unlike these algorithms, we do not optimize the learned (probabilistic) model, but derive from it p(x = x?|D), the probability of x being optimal.",2. Related work,[0],[0]
Our search distribution is then updated such as to minimize the KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence to p(x = x?|D).,2. Related work,[0],[0]
"Compared to these surrogate assisted local stochastic search algorithms (Loshchilov et al., 2013; Abdolmaleki et al., 2015), the transformation of the optimization landscape (minimizing the KL-divergence to p(x = x?|D) instead of the objective function) facilitates learning of the surrogate model by lowering the variance in poorly performing regions, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

To approximate p(x = x?|D),2. Related work,[0],[0]
we rely on a probabilistic modeling of the objective function and to select the next point to sample we locally optimize an acquisition function.,2. Related work,[0],[0]

The computational cost of the search distribution update in our algorithm is significantly higher than most local stochastic search algorithms.,5. Discussion,[0],[0]

"Secondly, the search distribution update is phrased as the minimization of the I-projection of p(x = x?|Dn), which has the property of focusing on one mode of the distribution (Bishop, 2006).",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, the Gaussian approximation of p(x = x?|Dn) can average over multiple modes if the GP is unsure about which of them is the highest.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
We expected that a better update direction can be obtained if a clustering algorithm can detect the highest mode from samples of p(x = x?|Dn).,5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Finally and perharps most interestingly, we expect our algorithm to be able to scale to significantly higher dimensional policies in an RL setting if a trajectory data kernel is used (Wilson et al., 2014).",5. Discussion,[0],[0]
"Specifically, distance between policies can be measured by the similarity of actions taken in similar states.",5. Discussion,[0],[0]

Our approach improves upon the storage and sample complexities of previous methods using a combination of extracting information from multiple buckets per table (hence reducing table complexity) and importance sampling (hence reducing sample complexity).,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As we show in our experimental study on GLOVE embeddings, our estimate of the number of elements that are 60 degrees from a query q (which corresponds to synonyms and/or related words to q in the English vocabulary), achieves multiple orders of magnitude improved accuracy over competing methods, subject to reasonable and practical resource constraints.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our theoretical analysis develops a rigorous understanding of our technique and offers practitioners further insight on optimizing our solution method for their particular datasets.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given a dataset D of vectors v1, . . .",2. Problem Formulation and Approach,[0],[0]
"vn ∈ Rd on the unit sphere, a query q ∈ Rd also on the unit sphere, and a range of angles of interestA, for example 0-60 degrees, how many elements v in D are such that the angle between q and v, denoted θqv, are within range A?",2. Problem Formulation and Approach,[0],[0]
We use Aq to denote the set of data vectors v that are within angle A to q (that have angular distance to query q that is in the range of interest A).,2. Problem Formulation and Approach,[0],[0]
"Our goal is to preprocess D in order to estimate the cardinality of this set, denoted |Aq|, efficiently for any given q.
One final note is that our scheme is conceptualized using bit-wise LSH functions; functions that hash vectors to 0-1 bits, and where the hamming distance between the hash sequences of two data points captures information about their angular distance.",2. Problem Formulation and Approach,[0],[0]
"For their simplicity, easy implementation, and high performance in practice, bit hashes such as hyperplane LSH (Charikar, 2002) are the standard hash functions used in practice for angular distance (Andoni et al., 2015).",2. Problem Formulation and Approach,[0],[0]
"Our technique and results can be extended for other hash functions; however, we will use hamming distance and other implementation details specific to bit-wise LSH functions in this work.",2. Problem Formulation and Approach,[0],[0]
Our overall estimation scheme is an implementation of importance sampling.,2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"It consists of two steps, a preprocessing step that applies locality sensitive hash functions to our dataset to produce hash tables.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"After this preprocessing step, we sample from our hash tables to produce our final estimate.
",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"To help guide the reader through the technical details of our implementation, we first offer an intuitive explanation of our approach.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Our importance sampling scheme achieves 2 main objectives: we concentrate the elements of interest
in our overall dataset into a few buckets that we can easily sample from, and we sample from these buckets to produce our estimate.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"In order to compensate for the concentrated sampling, we adjust the value of each sample by the inverse of the probability that the sample lands in the target buckets.
",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
Our technique relies on the key insight that LSH functions can effectively implement both of these objectives.,2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Using LSH functions to index our dataset ensures that for a given query q, elements that are close to q in angular distance have a comparative higher probability of hashing to q’s bucket and to buckets that are of small hamming distance to q’s bucket, thereby concentrating the elements of interest into certain buckets that we can selectively sample from.
",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Additionally, the hamming distance collision probabilities for bit-wise LSH functions are well expressed in terms of angular distance.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Consider random hyperplane LSH (Charikar, 2002), where each hash vector is chosen uniformly at random from the d-dimensional unit sphere.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Each hash vector r contributes one bit to the hash sequence of a data point v, based on the rule:
hr(v) =",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"{ 0 if r · v ≤ 0 1 otherwise.
",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]

"( t

",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Thus, the choice of t affects the sensitivity of the LSH scheme – the correlation between the hamming distances of two hash sequences and the angle between the two underlying data points.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Moreover, depending on the design choice for t, the set of hamming distances I that contains most of the probability mass for collision with elements of angular distance in range",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
A is different.,2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
This is also a consideration in our sampling scheme; we want to sample from buckets of hamming distances,2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"I that have a high probability of containing elements that are within angle A of q.
",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Our sampling scheme picks elements over K hash tables from buckets that are at hamming distance I to the query, where I is tuned to A.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Given a sample, x, we compute the angular distance θqx = cos−1(q · x).",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"Let p(x) = P(dqx ∈ I|θqx), the collision probability that x lands in a bucket that is hamming distance I from q over the random choice of hash functions.

Comparison to Related Work: Note that our problem can be viewed as kernel density estimation problem for a specific kernel function that has value 1 for pairs of points within the required angle range of interest and 0 outside.,2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"However the analysis of (Charikar & Siminelakis, 2017) does not apply to our setting because they need a scale free hash function (with collision probabilities related to the kernel value) and there is no such function for our 0-1 kernel.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"The work of (Spring & Shrivastava, 2017) does not make such an assumption on the hash function, but they do not give an analysis that gives meaningful bounds in our setting.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
"As noted previously, both works only look at a single hash bucket in each hash table, leading to a high storage overhead.",2.1. Approach Overview,[0],[0]
We establish the following theoretical bounds on the storage and sample complexity of our estimator in order to achieve a (1±ε)-approximation to the true count with high probability.,2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
Theorem 2.1 (Main Result).,2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"For a given angular distance range of interest A and a given query q, with probability 1 − δ, our estimator returns a (1 ± ε)approximation to |Aq|, the true number of elements within

",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"To help the reader digest this result, we briefly compare this statement to the sample complexity of naive random sampling.",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"It can be shown through a standard BernoulliChernoff argument that the sample complexity for random sampling is O( n|Aq|ε2 ln ( 1 δ ) ), where n|Aq| is the inverse proportion of elements of interest in the overall population.",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"Intuitively this says that you need to take more random samples if |Aq| is very small compared to n.
Our sample complexity replaces the n|Aq| term with E(Cq(I)) |Aq|· min x∈Aq p(x) , where |Aq| · minx∈Aq p(x) is a measure of the expected number of elements from the set of interest Aq that will land in hamming distance I to q, and E(Cq(I)) is
the expected size of the overall sampling pool of elements in hamming distance I.",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
This ratio of expectations seems intuitive – one would expect to get such an expression if our scheme took one sample per table.,2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"Surprisingly, we achieve this same type of sample complexity bound while sampling from relatively few hash tables.
",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"Just like random sampling, our sample complexity bound is also based on the proportion of elements of interest in hamming distance I to the total number of elements in hamming distance I.",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"However, it is easy to see that applying LSH to our dataset will increase this proportion to yield a smaller sample complexity.",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"We choose I so that min
x∈Aq p(x) is high
(this probability can be high even for a small set of hamming distances I, since p(x) is the cumulative probability mass of I successes in t trials, and binomial distributions in t concentrate in an O( √ t) sized interval around the mean), and E(Cq(I)) to be small (to filter out elements that are not interesting).
",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
There are certain tradeoffs to choosing I .,2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"If more hamming distances are included in I, then min
x∈Aq p(x) is higher, how-
ever, E(Cq(I)) is also larger.",2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
The optimal choice for I is to choose the hamming distances that substantially increase min x∈Aq p(x) yet do not substantially increase E(Cq(I)),2.2. Main Result,[0],[0]
"(so not too many uninteresting elements are infiltrating those buckets).

Setting up quality hash tables to enable accurate and efficient importance sampling is vital to our scheme.,3.1. Hash Tables,[0],[0]
"Since we are importance sampling from buckets of hamming distance I acrossK tables, we need to make enough tables to guarantee unbiasedness or near-unbiasedness for our sampling-based estimator; due to the variance of the randomly generated hash functions, if we make too few tables we may not find enough elements of interest contained in those tables within hamming distance I.",3.1.

In the rest of this paper we discuss the results of our experiments on real datasets.,4. Sampling,[0],[0]
We describe our experiments using the GLOVE dataset.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We use the set of 400,000 pre-trained 50-dimensional word embedding vectors trained from Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5, provided by (Pennington et al., 2014).",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We normalize the embeddings, as is standard in many word embedding applications (Sugawara et al., 2016)",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We choose 3 query words with different neighborhood profiles: “venice”, “cake”, “book”.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Venice has the smallest neighborhood, with 206 elements with angular distance less than 60 degrees, cake has a medium sized neighborhood with about 698 elements, book has the largest neighborhood with 1275 elements.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The histogram for these 3 queries are shown in Figure 1.
",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We also choose our angle range of interest, A, to be 0- 60 degrees.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"A search through our dataset gave “florence”, “cannes”, “rome” as representative elements that are 40-50
degrees from “venice”, and “renaissance”, “milan”, “tuscany”, “italy” in the 50-60 degree range.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Terms such as “cheesecake”, “desserts”, “ganache”, and “bakes” appear in the 40-50 degree annulus around “cake”, while terms such as “fruitcake”, “cupcake”, “confections”, “poundcake”, and “eggs” appear in the 50-60 degree histogram.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For “book”: “character”, “chronicles”, “paperback”, “authors”, and “text” are in the 40-50 degree range while “bestseller”, “protagonist”, “publishers”, “booklet”, “publishes”, “editing”, “monograph”, and “chapter” are in the 50-60 degree range.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This particular experiment shows that while elements in the 40-50 degree range are extremely related, words in the 50-60 degree range are also relevant, and so we fix A to be 0-60 degrees in all of our experiments.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We also fix t = 20 in all of our experiments, since we have 400,000 embeddings in total and 20 ≈ log2(400, 000).
",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As Table 1 illustrates, the biggest challenge for this estimation problem is the fact that the count of the number of elements within 0-60 degrees is dwarfed by the number of elements 60-120 degrees away from the queries.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]

As we have previously mentioned in section 3.1, the number of tables K theoretically required for (near) unbiased estimation relies on a worst-case variance bound; real-world data do not necessarily exhibit worst-case behavior.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In our studies of our 3 queries see Figures 2, the inherent bias of our estimator decreases as we increase the sampling ham-
ming threshold.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is as expected, using a larger range of hamming distances helps concentrate the count of the elements of interest Aq that fall into the specified range of hamming distances around the mean, which means that a smaller K is required to achieve small bias.
",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Moreover, the empirical bias of our estimator at hamming threshold 5 is around 5% for 20 hash tables, with very little improvement with 40 hash tables.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is consistent with our 3 queries.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"With this in mind, we compare our estimator against the benchmark estimator introduced by (Spring & Shrivastava, 2017).",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Though their work originally intended to solve a different problem, their technique can solve our problem by adapting the weight function appropriately.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The key differences between their work and ours is that they only probe the 0 hamming distance bucket in each table, similar to the classic LSH literature, and instead of sampling, they simply enumerate the elements in the hamming distance 0 bucket for each table.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For higher values of K, which our experiments demonstrate that their estimator needs in order to get good results, enumeration might not be so efficient.
",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In Figure 3, we compare (Spring & Shrivastava, 2017)’s technique of enumerating and importance-weighting hamming distance 0 elements to our technique of importance sampling from different hamming thresholds.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our experiments use random hyperplane LSH and we report relative error averaged over 25 trials, where in each trial we generate a new set of K tables.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Panel (b) experiments with (Spring & Shrivastava, 2017)’s technique for the 3 queries, with different choices of K, the number of tables.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our results show that even for K = 40 tables, the relative error of their technique can still be higher than 50%, particularly for queries with small neighborhoods such as “venice”.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
For “venice” the increase in table allocation from 20 to 40 made a very small difference to the overall estimation error.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"“book” and “cake” fared better at 40 tables, however, the error was still around 25 %, while our estimator (panel a) estimated to within about 10% error using only 20 tables.
",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
Panel (a) of Figure 3 shows that utilizing any hamming threshold greater than 0 gives superior estimation performance to staying only within the 0 hamming distance bucket.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, we fix our sampling budget to 1000 samples and the table budget to 20 tables.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
The hamming distance 0 error reported in this figure uses enumeration; all other hamming thresholds use the 1000 sampling budget.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In our experiments for the 3 queries, one can expect about 80 points in total in the hamming distance 0 buckets across 20 tables.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In this experiment, our technique uses 1000 samples vs 80 points, however, this (somewhat negligible in today’s computing infrastructure) sample complexity trades off against a large improvement in precision, as well as a much lower storage cost in the number of tables K.
Finally, we note that panel (a) of Figure 3 shows the smallest
error for “venice” at hamming threshold 3.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is related to the characteristics of this query and the sampling budget.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We see in this example that for “venice”, which is a fairly isolated data point compared to the other 2 queries, going to further hamming distances actually hurts the quality of the estimate because we actually dilute the proportion of interesting elements.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Using higher thresholds typically requires more samples, as shown in Figure 4.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, higher thresholds typically lowers the inherent bias in the importance sampling scheme, as demonstrated in Figure 2.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
Implementers should consider this tradeoff in their algorithmic design choices.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Given the case study of our estimator achieving the smallest estimation error for “venice” at hamming threshold 3, whereas for the more popular queries “cake” and “book” performance improves steadily at higher hamming thresholds, it would be interesting to, from the practitioner’s point of view, understand what is the best hamming threshold to sample from, and given a hamming threshold, how many samples should be taken for a quality estimate.",6. Discussion,[0],[0]
"The optimal
sample complexity is data-dependent, and cannot be known without a sense of |Aq|, the very quantity we aim to estimate.",6. Discussion,[0],[0]
"But instead of fixing the sample complexity up-front, is there a way we can iteratively, in an on-line fashion, determine whether we should keep sampling or stop, based on a current belief of |Aq|?",6. Discussion,[0],[0]

"Hypothesis testing is a widely applied statistical tool used to test whether given models should be rejected, or not, based on sampled data from a population.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Hypothesis testing was initially developed for scientific and survey data, but today it is also an essential tool to test models over collections of social network, mobile, and crowdsourced data (American Statistical Association, 2014; Hunter et al., 2008; Steele et al., 2017).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Collected data samples may contain highly sensitive information about the subjects, and the privacy of individuals can be compromised when the results of a data analysis are released.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A way to address this concern is by developing new techniques to support privacy-preserving data analysis.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Among the different approaches, differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006b) has emerged as a viable solution: it provides strong privacy guarantees and it allows to release accurate statistics.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A standard way to achieve differential privacy is by injecting some statistical noise in the computation of the data analysis.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"When the noise is carefully chosen, it helps to protect the individual privacy without compromising the utility of the data analysis.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

These tests work in the curator model of differential privacy.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this model, the data is centrally stored and the curator carefully injects noise in the computation of the data analysis in order to satisfy differential privacy.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work we instead address the local model of privacy, formally introduced by Raskhodnikova et al. (2008).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The first differentially private algorithm called randomized response – in fact it predates the definition of differential privacy by more than 40 years – guarantees differential privacy in the local model (Warner, 1965).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this model, there is no trusted centralized entity that is responsible for the noise injection.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead, each individual adds enough noise to guarantee differential privacy for their own data, which provides a stronger privacy guarantee than the curator model.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The data analysis is then run over the collection of the individually sanitized data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The local model of differential privacy is a convenient model for several applications: for example it is used to collect statistics about the activity of the Google Chrome Web browser users (Erlingsson et al., 2014), and to collect statistics about the typing patterns of Apple’s iPhone users (Apple Press Info, 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite these applications, the local model has received far less attention than the centralized curator model.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is in part due to the more firm requirements imposed by this model, which make the design of effective data analysis harder.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our main contribution is in designing chi-square hypothesis tests for the local model of differential privacy.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Similar to previous works we focus on goodness of fit and independence hypothesis tests.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most of the private chi-square tests proposed so far are based on mechanisms that add noise in some form to the aggregate data, e.g. the cells of the contingency tables, or the resulting chi-square statistics value.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"These approaches cannot be used in the local model, since noise needs to be added at the individual’s data level.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We then consider instead general privatizing techniques in the local model, and we study how to build new hypothesis tests with them.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Each test we present is characterized by a specific local model mechanism.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The main technical challenge for designing each test is to create statistics, which incorporate the local model mechanisms, that converge as
we collect more data to a chi-square distribution, as in the classical chi-square tests.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We then use these statistics to find the critical value to correctly bound the Type I error.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present three different goodness of fit tests: LocalNoiseGOF presents a statistic that guarantees the convergence to a chi-square distribution under the null hypothesis so that we can use the correct critical values when local (concentrated) differential privacy is guaranteed by adding Laplace or Gaussian noise to the individual data; LocalGenRRGOF also provides a statistic that converges to a chi-square under the null hypothesis when a private value for each individual is selected by using a generalized form of randomized response, which can also be thought of as an instantiation of the exponential mechanism (McSherry & Talwar, 2007); finally, LocalBitFlipGOF introduces a statistic that converges to a chi-square distribution when the data is privatized using a bit flipping algorithm (Bassily & Smith, 2015), which provide better accuracy for higher dimensional data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Further, we develop corresponding independence tests: LocalNoiseIND (see supplementary file), LocalGenRRIND, and LocalBitFlipIND.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
For all these tests we study their asymptotic behavior.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A desiderata for private hypothesis tests is to have a guaranteed upper bound on the probability of a false discovery (or Type I error) – rejecting a null hypothesis or model when the data was actually generated from it – and to minimize the probability of a Type II error, which is failing to reject the null hypothesis when the model is indeed false.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This latter criteria corresponds to the power of the statistical test.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We then present experimental results showing the power of the different tests which demonstrates that no single local differentially private algorithm is best across all data dimensions and privacy parameter regimes.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this evaluation also shows a relation between the power of the test and the noncentral parameter of the test statistic that is used.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This suggests that besides looking at the parameters of the test, a data analyst may need also to consider which test statistic results in the largest noncentral parameter.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"Following a similar logic as Lemma 2, S0T must directly connect to the true positive children of T .",3.1. Local Structure Learning,[0],[0]
"Because Step 2 of Algorithm 1 queries every variable in V and S0T must be dependent of nonadjacent T given PC0T , to capture the correct independence relationships with the locally consistent score, S0T must be included in ST .

"Secondly, we show false positive PCs and spouses will be removed.",3.1. Local Structure Learning,[0],[0]
"Since all the true positive PC nodes and spouses are present in the last iteration, the false positive PC nodes (the non-MB descendants by Lemma 4), if exist, should be adjacent to the true positive PC nodes and spouses in G.

"Using the local structures, one alternative approach to global structure learning is to learn the local structures of all nodes and then combine them to construct the global graph structure from the existing local graphs.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"Many algorithms (Margaritis & Thrun, 1999; Niinimaki & Parviainen, 2012) first use the AND-rule to resolve the potential conflicts among different local structures between adjacent variables, and then use the Meek rules (Meek, 1995) to obtain the final DAG.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"The AND-rule seems arbitrary in the learning results and can introduce errors if one of the neighbors learns a wrong local graph, hence affecting the accuracy of the final global graph.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
One naive way to solve such conflicts is to re-run the subroutine BNStructLearn on the variable set containing both neighbor sets to redetermine the existence of the edges.,3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"However, the procedure is inefficient as it repeats learning for local structures of every edge after repeating for every node, relearning the same parts of the graph multiple times.
",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"We propose to anchor the learning at one target variable T , and then grow the graph by gradually expanding it.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"It is made possible as the LocalLearn does not require neighbors’ local structure to learn T ’s neighborhood correctly, unlike previous algorithms.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
We only use the necessary variables at each iteration to expand the graph while keeping other parts of the learned graph fixed.,3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
The proposed graph growing structure learning (GGSL) algorithm is shown in Algorithm 2.,3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"Starting from an empty graph, GGSL iteratively updates the global graph by using LocalLearn to learn the local structure of one target variable T at a time.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
Each local learning uses the set consisting of the current local variables of the target variable in the learned graph G and variables that are not in the local structures of any variable.,3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
Then GGSL updates G with learned results using updateGraph.,3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"It runs until all but one variable is not learned and has four main steps:
",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"Step 1: GGSL chooses one target variable T at each iteration, first chosen randomly and then based on query set Q, which contains adjacent nodes of the already queried variables in the graph G. Q can be maintained as a regular queue (first in, first out).",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"Queried variable set A keeps all the learned T s and prevents repeated learning.
",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
Step 2:,3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"GGSL uses LocalLearn shown in Algorithm 1 to find the local structure of the target variable over the query set Z. This step resolves the potential edge conflicts through efficient learning, avoiding the simple AND-rule used by other local-to-global structure learning algorithms The main difference between each run of LocalLearn is that the previous T ’s will not be considered, unless they are in the local structure of the current target variable.",3.2.

"For the first target variable T1, GGSL finds the correct local structure of one target variable by Theorem 1.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
The updated DAG G is sound and complete for T1.,3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"Starting from the second iteration i ≥ 2, since the learned graph
G is shown to be correct, if any variable in the target variable Ti’s MB set has been queried or saved, they must exist in the PC and Sp variable, hence in Z of Algorithm 3.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"With the rest of variables complementing the PC and Sp variables, all the true positive PC set and spouse set of Ti must be included in the set Z of Algorithm 3.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"By Theorem 1 again, the local structure learned must be sound and complete.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"Hence, at each iteration of Algorithm 2, the updated DAG G must be sound and complete for all Tis as well.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]
"Since the PDAG-to-DAG subroutine is also proven to orient the correct DAG from PDAG (Meek, 1995), the result DAG G at the end of Algorithm 2 must be in the Markov equivalent class of G0.",3.2. Local-to-Global Learning,[0],[0]

"LocalLearn finds D and C as B’s local structure, and updates G. With T3 = C, LocalLearn finds the same A and D and does not make new update of G.

Similarly, LocalLearn finds the directed edge E−F and H−F due to the definitive V-structure and update G accordingly, shown in Figure 1b, when Ti = E and F .",3.3. Case Study,[0],[0]

"While Algorithm 2 is theoretically sound and complete, in practice further optimizations in the algorithmic procedure can be implemented.",3.4. Implementation Optimization,[0],[0]
"First, inside the iterative LocalLearn procedure, variables in the existing PC and Sp set of Ti should be queried first.",3.4. Implementation Optimization,[0],[0]
These true positive MB set variables could potentially reduce the queried set size to BNStructLearn at each iteration by removing non-MB set of variables early in the process.,3.4. Implementation Optimization,[0],[0]
"Using this procedure is similar to the idea behind an improved version of LocalLearn (Gao & Ji, 2017), which is shown to improve accuracy and reduce computational time.",3.4. Implementation Optimization,[0],[0]
"Secondly, using the same concept, one can also keep track of which variables are removed from Ti’s local structure after adding each queried variable X for target Ti’s local learning procedure, hence forming a separation set, or sepset, of X from T .",3.4. Implementation Optimization,[0],[0]
"Querying variables from the sepset first when X becomes the target could also reduce the potential query set variable size to LocalLearn, as sepset variables are more likely to be adjacent variables of X .",3.4. Implementation Optimization,[0],[0]

Consider the video and natural language query in Figure 1 where we seek to localize the desired moment in the video specified by the query.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Queries like “the girl bends down” require understanding objects and actions, but do not require reasoning about different video moments.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, queries like “the little girl talks after bending down” require reasoning about the temporal relationship between different actions (“talk” and “bend down”).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Localizing natural language queries in video is an important challenge, recently studied in Hendricks et al. (2017) and Gao et al. (2017) with applications in areas such as video search and retrieval.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We argue that to
∗Work done at Adobe during LAH’s summer internship.
properly localize queries with temporal language, models must understand and reason about intravideo context.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Reasoning about intra-video context is difficult as we do not know a priori which moments should be involved in the contextual reasoning and different queries may require reasoning about different contextual moments.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, in “the little girl talks after bending down”, the relevant contextual moment “bending down” occurs just before the target moment “the little girl talks”.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This is in contrast to the query “the little girl talks before bending down” where the relevant contextual moment occurs just after.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A limitation of current moment-localization models (Hendricks et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017) is they consider query-independent video context when localizing moments.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, when determining whether a proposed temporal region matches a natural language query, Gao et al. (2017) considers the proposed temporal region, as well as video regions just before and after the proposed region.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Hendricks et al. (2017) considers video context in the form of a global-context feature which represents the entire video.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While both may implicitly include the appropriate contextual moment in their context feature, they do not explicitly determine the relevant context for the query.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To address this difficulty, we propose Moment
Localization with Latent Context (MLLC) which models video context as a latent variable.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The latent variable enables the model to attend to different video contexts conditioned on the specific query/video pair, offering flexibility in the location and length of the contextual moment and overcoming the limitation of query-independent contextual reasoning.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We validate the importance of latent context by showing that our model performs well both on simple queries without temporal words and more complex queries requiring temporal reasoning.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, our formulation is generic and unifies approaches in Hendricks et al. (2017) and Gao et al. (2017), allowing us to ablate model component choices, as well as which kind of video context is best for localizing moments described with temporal language.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Though datasets used for moment localization in video (Hendricks et al., 2017; Regneri et al., 2013; Sigurdsson et al., 2016) include temporal language, as we will show, there is not enough temporal language to effectively train and evaluate models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We seek to extensively study this aspect, particularly with respect to temporal prepositions (Pratt-Hartmann, 2004).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, we collect the TEMPOral reasoning in video and language (TEMPO) dataset which builds off the recently collected DiDeMo dataset (Hendricks et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The dataset consists of two parts: a dataset with real videos and sentences created with a template model (TEMPO - Template Language (TL)), and a dataset with real videos and newly collected user-provided temporal annotations (TEMPO - Human Language (HL)).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Considering template sentences allows us to create a large dataset of sentences quickly for study of temporal language in a controlled setting.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The human language data then allows us to see these trends transfer to more complex human-language queries.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For data collection, we focus on the most common temporal referring words naturally occurring in language-and-video datasets.

(ii) We propose MLLC for moment localization which treats video context as a latent variable and unifies prior approaches for moment localization.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Gao et al. (2017) includes an additional loss to regress to start and end-points, whereas Hendricks et al. (2017) simplifies the problem by choosing from a discrete set of video segments.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Importantly, to represent a proposed video segment, both models consider context features around a moment: Hendricks et al. (2017) uses global context by averaging features over an entire input video, and Gao et al. (2017) incorporates features adjacent to the proposed video segment.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We argue that to do proper temporal reasoning, pre-determined, query independent context features may not cover all possible temporal relations.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Thus, we propose to model the context as a latent variable, allowing our method to learn which context moments to consider as a function of the video and importantly, the query.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Both Gao et al. (2017) and Hendricks et al. (2017) collect data to test their models; Gao et al.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"(2017) considers the Charades (Sigurdsson et al., 2016) and TACoS (Regneri et al., 2013) datasets.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"While TACoS includes localized sentences, Charades only has sentences and activity detection localizations, so a semi-automatic method is used to align action detection annotations to visual descriptions in Charades.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Hendricks et al. (2017) collected the Distinct Describable Moment (DiDeMo) dataset, which consists of Flickr (Thomee et al., 2016) videos with localized referring expressions.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Both Charades and DiDeMo contain a large set of diverse videos (approximately 10,000 videos each).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We chose to base TEMPO on DiDeMo because it contains more clip/sentence pairs (40,000 vs. 13,000), and is focused on general videos which we believe is
an interesting and useful scenario, rather than being restricted to indoor activities.

Temporal Language.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Prior work on temporal language processing has considered building explicit logical frameworks to process temporal prepositions like “during” or “until” (Pratt-Hartmann (2004), Konur (2008)).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We do not derive a particular temporal logic, but rather learn to understand temporal language in a data driven fashion.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we specifically consider how to understand temporal words commonly used when referring to video content.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Other work has modeled dynamics for words which represent a change of state (e.g., “pick up”)",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"( Siskind (2001), Yu et al. (2015)) in limited environments.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Though we limit the selection of temporal words in our study, the natural language in our data is open-world describing diverse events and how they relate to each other in video.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Interpretation of temporal expressions in text (“The game happened on the 19th”) is a widely studied task (Angeli et al. (2012), Zhong et al. (2017)).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our work is distinctly different from this line of work as we specifically study temporal prepositions and how they refer to video.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Modeling Visual Relationships.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"A variety of papers have considered modeling spatial relationships in natural images (Dai et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Peyre et al., 2017; Plummer et al., 2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Our approach is analogous to this in the temporal domain; we hope to localize moments in videos.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"CLEVR, a synthetic visual question answering (VQA) dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), was created to allow researchers to systematically study the ability of models to perform complex reasoning.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Our dataset is partially motivated by the success of CLEVR to enable researchers to study reasoning abilities of different models in a controlled setting.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast to CLEVR we consider a more diverse visual input in the form of real videos.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In the video domain, the TGIF-QA (Jang et al., 2017) and Mario-QA (Mun et al., 2016) datasets provide opportunities to study temporal reasoning for the task of VQA.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The TGIF-QA dataset considers three types of temporal questions: before/after questions, repetition count, and determining a repeating action.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Each question is accompanied by multiple choice answers.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Videos we consider are much longer (25-30s as opposed to an average of 3.1s) which makes the use of temporal reasoning much more important.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The MarioQA dataset is an additional VQA dataset de-
signed to gauge temporal reasoning of VQA systems.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Both TGIF-QA and MarioQA datasets include template-based natural language queries.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we consider synthetic queries similar to TGIF-QA and MarioQA, but also include human language queries.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In addition, unlike the MarioQA dataset, that consists of synthetic data constructed from gameplay videos, our dataset consists of real visual inputs, and includes temporal grounding of natural language phrases.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, neither TGIFQA nor MarioQA include temporal localization.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Given a video v and natural-language query q describing a moment in the video, our goal is to output the moment τ =",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"( τ (s), τ (e) )",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"where τ (s) and τ (e) are temporal start and end points in the video, respectively.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"In the following, we formulate a generic, unified model which encompasses prior approaches (Hendricks et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
This allows us to explore and evaluate trade offs for different model components and extensions which then leads to higher performance.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Unlike prior work, we consider a latent context variable which enables our model to better reason about temporal language.
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Let the moment τ corresponding to the text query be the base moment and the set of other video moments Tτ be possible context moments for τ .,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"We define a scoring function between the video moment and natural-language query by maximizing over all possible context moments
τ ′",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"∈ Tτ ,
sφ (v, q, τ) = max τ ′∈Tτ
fS ( fV ( v, τ, τ ′ ) , fL (q) ) ,
(1) where fV and fL are functions computing features over the video and language query, fS is a similarity function, and φ are model parameters.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
This formulation is generic and trivially encompasses the MCN and TALL formulations by letting the set of possible context moments Tτ be their respective single-context moment.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows the generic structure of our model.
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"With this formulation, we seek to answer the following questions: (i) Which combination of model components performs best for the momentretrieval task?",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Though our primary goal is localizing moments with temporal language, we believe a good base moment retrieval model is important for localizing moments with temporal language.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
(ii) How best to incorporate context for moment retrieval with temporal language?,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"We first detail the different terms and outline different model design choices, where design choices marked with bolditalic font is ablated in Section 5.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Components which are used in our final proposed Moment Localization with Latent Context (MLLC) model and prior models are summarized in Table 3.
Video feature fV .",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"The video feature fV = (g (v, τ) , g (v, τ ′) , fT (τ, τ
′)) is a concatenation of visual features for the base g (v, τ) and context g (v, τ ′) moments and endpoint features fT (τ, τ
′).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"To compute visual features g for a temporal region τ , per-frame features are averaged over the temporal region.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Note that if the context moment consists of more than one contiguous temporal region, then the visual features are computed over each contiguous temporal region and then concatenated (c.f., before/after context in TALL, explained below).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
There are many choices for visual features.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"TALL (Gao et al., 2017) compares average fc7 features (extracted from (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014)) to features extracted with C3D (Tran et al., 2015) and LSTM features (Donahue et al., 2015).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Surprisingly, C3D features only outperform average fc7 features by a small margin.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"We use the visual features used in the MCN model (Hendricks et al., 2017), which are similar to the fc7 features from (Gao et al., 2017), but included motion features as well, computed from optical flow (extracted with (Wang et al., 2016)).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"We then pass the extracted visual
features through a MLP.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Note that we learn separate embedding functions for RGB and optical flow inputs and combine scores from different input modalities using a late-fusion approach (Hendricks et al., 2017).
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Endpoint feature fT .,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Modeling temporal context requires understanding how different temporal segments relate in time.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Hendricks et al. (2017) suggest including temporal endpoint features (TEF) fT = ( τ (s), τ (e) ) for the base moment which encode when the moment starts and ends to better localize sentences which include words like “first” and “last”.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Note that TALL (Gao et al., 2017) does not incorporate TEFs.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"In order to understand temporal relationships, it is important that models also include features which indicate when a context moment occurs.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"In addition to providing TEFs for base moments, we also experiment with concatenating TEFs for context moments (conTEF) fT = ( τ (s), τ (e), τ ′(s), τ ′(e) ) .
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Language feature fL. Text queries are transformed into a fixed-length vector with an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Before inputting words into the LSTM, they are embedded in the Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) embedding space.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
The final layer of the LSTM is projected into the shared video-language embedding space with a fully connected layer.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Gao et al. (2017) considers LSTM language features and Skip-thought encoders.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Our main goal is to study how context impacts moment localization with temporal language, so we use the LSTM features used on the original DiDeMo dataset.
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Similarity fS .,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Given video fV and language fL features, we consider three ways to encode similarity between the features.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Like Hendricks et al. (2017), we consider a distance-based similarity fS = ( |fV − fL|2 ) .",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Second, we consider a fused-feature similarity (mult) where the Hadamard product fV fL between the two features are passed to a MLP.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
We also explore unit normalizing features before the Hadamard product (normalized mult).,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Finally, we consider the similarity (TALL similarity) which consists of the concatenation (fV , fL, fV fL, fV + fL) and then passed to a MLP.
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Context moments,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Tτ .,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
We consider three sets of context moments.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"First, we consider the entire video as the context moment (global) following Hendricks et al. (2017).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Second, we consider us-
ing the moments just before and after the base moment (before/after).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Finally, we consider using the set of all possible moments (latent context) which offers greatest flexibility in contextual reasoning.
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Training loss.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
We consider two training losses.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
The first loss is the MCN ranking loss which encourages positive moment/query pairs to have a smaller distance in a shared embedding space than negative moment/query pairs.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"To sample negative moment/sentence pairs, they consider negative moments within a specific video (called intravideo negative moments) and negative moments in different videos (called inter-video negative moments).",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
This sampling strategy leads to a small improvement in performance (approximately one point on all metrics) when compared to just using intra-video negative moments.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"We also consider the alignment loss used in TALL (TALL loss) which is the sum of two log-logistic functions over positive and negative training query/moment pairs (intra-video negatives are used).
",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Supervising context moments.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"For the temporal sentences in our newly collected dataset (Section 4), we have access to the ground-truth context moment during training.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Thus, we can contrast a weakly supervised setting in which we optimize over the unknown latent context moments during learning and inference to a strongly supervised setting.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Implementation details.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Candidate base and context moments coincide to the pre-segmented fivesecond segments used when annotating DiDeMo.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Moments may consist of any contiguous set of five-second segments.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"For a 30-second video partitioned into six five-second segments, there are 21 possible moments.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"All models were implemented in Caffe (Jia et al., 2014) and optimized with SGD.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
"Models were trained for ∼ 90 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.05, which decreases every 30 epochs.",3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
Code is publicly released∗.,3 Moment Localization with Latent Context,[0],[0]
We collect the TEMPOral reasoning in video and language (TEMPO) dataset based off the recently released DiDeMo dataset.,4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
Our dataset consists of two parts: TEMPO - Template Language (TL) and TEMPO - Human Language (HL).,4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"We create TEMPO - TL using language templates to augment the original sentences in DiDeMo with tem∗https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/ ˜lisa_anne/tempo.html
poral words.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
The template allows us to generate a large number of sentences with known ground truth base and context moments.,4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"However, template language lacks the complexity of human language, so we then collect an additional fully userconstructed dataset, TEMPO - HL, consisting of sentences that contain specific temporal words.
",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
Temporal Words in Current Datasets.,4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
We first analyze temporal words which occur in current natural language moment retrieval datasets.,4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"We consider temporal adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions found both by closely analyzing moment-localization datasets and consulting lists containing words which belong to different parts of speech.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"In particular, we rely on the preposition project (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005)† to scrape relevant temporal words.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Table 2 shows example temporal words and the number of times they occur in each dataset (TACoS (Regneri et al., 2013), Charades (Gao et al., 2017), DiDeMo (Hendricks et al., 2017)).",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Though all moment localization datasets use temporal words, they do not contain enough examples to reliably train and evaluate current models.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Additionally, we observe that temporal words which are frequently used when describing video segments are different than those commonly used in text without video grounding.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"For example, in PrattHartmann (2004), “during” is a common example, but we observe that “during” is infrequently used when describing video.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Of temporal words, we focus on the four most common words, “before”, “after”, “then”, and “while” when creating our dataset.
",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
TEMPO - Template Language.,4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"To construct sentences in TEMPO-TL, we find adjacent moments in the DiDeMo dataset and fill in template sentences for “before”, “after”, and “then” temporal words.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"For “before”, we use two templates: “X before Y ” and “Before Y , X”, where X and Y are sentences from the original DiDeMo dataset.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Likewise for “after”, we consider the templates “X after Y ” and “After Y , X”.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"For “then” we only consider one template, “X then Y .”
TEMPO - Human Language.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Though the template dataset is an interesting testbed for understanding temporal language, it is difficult to replicate the interesting complexities in human language.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]

"tences with temporal prepositions, humans frequently make use of language structure such as coreference to form more cohesive statements.
",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"To collect annotations, we follow the protocol in Hendricks et al. (2017) and segment videos into 5-second temporal segments.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"After collecting descriptions, we ensure descriptions are localizable by asking other workers to localize each moment.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"To collect data for “before”, “after”, and “then”, we ask annotators to describe a segment in relation to a “reference” moment from the DiDeMo dataset.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"For example, if the DiDeMo dataset includes a localized phrase like “the cat jumps”, annotators write a sentence which refers to the segment “the cat jumps” using a specific temporal word.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"We provide both the phrase (“the cat jumps”) and the reference moment to annotators, and the annotators provide a sentence describing a new moment which references the reference moment.
",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
TEMPO-HL includes unique properties which are hard to replicate with template data.,4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Figure 3
depicts the base moment provided to workers, as well as descriptions from TEMPO-HL.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"In Figure 3, the description “The adult hands the little boy the stick then they walk away” includes an example of visual coreference (“they”).",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"We note that use of pronouns is much more prevalent in TEMPO-HL, with 28.1% of sentences in TEMPOHL including pronouns (“he”, “she”, “it”) in contrast to 10.3% of sentences in the original DiDeMo dataset.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
"Additionally, annotators will refer to the base moment with different language than originally used in the base moment (e.g., “the girl waves at the camera” versus the base moment “the girl looks at the camera and waves”) in order to make their sentences more fluent.",4 The TEMPO Dataset,[0],[0]
Evaluation Method.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We follow the evaluation protocol defined for the DiDeMo dataset (Hendricks et al., 2017) over all possible combinations of the five-second video segments.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We report rank at one (R@1), rank at five (R@5), and mean intersection over union (mIOU) using their aggregator over three out of the four human annotators.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We compare our models on TEMPOTL, TEMPO-HL, and the DiDeMo dataset.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"When training our models, we combine the DiDeMo dataset with TEMPO-TL or TEMPO-HL.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This enables our model to concurrently learn to localize the simpler DiDeMo sentences with more complex TEMPO sentences.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Baselines.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We compare to the two recently proposed approaches for video moment localization: MCN (Hendricks et al., 2017) and TALL (Gao et al., 2017).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We adapt the implementation of TALL (Gao et al., 2017) to the DiDeMo dataset in three ways.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"First, we do not include the temporal localization loss required to regress to specific start and end points as DiDeMo, and thus also TEMPO, is pre-segmented, so the model does not need to compute exact start and end points.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Second, the original TALL model uses C3D features.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
For a fair comparison we train both models with the same RGB and flow features extracted as was done for the original MCN model.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, the MCN model proposes temporal endpoint features (TEF) to indicate when a proposed moment occurs within a video.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We train TALL with and without the TEF and show that TEF improves performance on the original DiDeMo dataset.
Ablations.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To ablate our proposed latent context, we compare to other models which share the same MLLC base network.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We consider the MLLC model with global context and before/after context.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We also train a model with weakly supervised (WS) latent context and strongly supervised (SS) latent context.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We also train models both with and without context TEF (conTEF).
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The MLLC Base Model.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We first ablate our MLLC base model (Table 3).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We train our models on TEMPO-TL and DiDeMo and evaluate on the original DiDeMo dataset.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
All models are trained with global context.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We find that the ranking loss is preferable on the DiDeMo dataset (compare lines 1 and 2) and that TALL-similarity performs better than the distance based similarity of the MCN model (compare lines 1 and 5).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"A simpler version of the TALL-similarity, in which the concatenated element wise multiplication, element wise sum, and concatenation is replaced by a single normalized elementwise multiplication, increases R@1 by almost one point and increases mIoU by over two points (compare lines 5-7).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We call our best model the MLLC-Base model (line 7).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our MLLC-Base model performs better than previous models (MCN line 1 and TALL line 3).
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Results: TEMPO - TL.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We first compare different moment localization models on TEMPO - TL (Table 4).,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In particular, our model performs well on “before” and “after” words.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Additionally,
our MLLC model with global context outperforms both the MCN model (Hendricks et al., 2017) and the TALL (Gao et al., 2017) model when considering all sentence types, verifying the strength of our base MLLC model.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Comparing MLLC with global context and MLLC with before/after context (compare row 4 and 5), we note that before/after context is important for localizing “before” and “after” moments.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, our model with strong supervision (row 9) outperforms the model trained with before and after context, suggesting that learning to reason about which context moment is correct (as opposed to being explicitly provided with the context before and after the moment) is beneficial.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We note that strong supervision (SS) outperforms weak supervision (WS) (compare rows 7 and 9) and that the context TEF is important for best performance (compare rows 8 and 9).
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We note that though the MLLC-global model outperforms our full model for “then” on TEMPOTL, our full model performs better on then for the TEMPO-HL (Table 6).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
One possibility is that the “then” moments in TEMPO-TL do not require context to properly localize the moment.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Because TEMPO-TL is constructed from DiDeMo sentences, constituent sentence parts are referring.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For example, given an example sentence from TEMPO-TL (e.g., “The cross is seen for the first time then window is first seen in room”), the model does not need to reason about the ordering of “cross seen for the first time” and “window is seen for the first time” because both moments only happen once in the video.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In contrast, when considering the sentence “The adult hands the little boy a stick then they begin to walk” (from Figure 3), “begin to walk” could refer to multiple video moments.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Consequently, our model must reason about the temporal ordering of reference moments to properly localize the video moment.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On TEMPO - TL, sentences differ from original DiDeMo sentences solely because of the use of temporal words.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Thus, we can do a controlled study of how well models understand temporal words.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"If a model has good temporal reasoning, then if it can localize a reference moment “the dog jumps” it should be easier for the model to localize the moment “the dog sits after the dog jumps”.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"To test whether models are capable of this, we look at only sentences in TEMPO - TL where the model has correctly localized the cor-
responding context moment in DiDeMo (Table 5).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We report the difference in performance when considering only sentences in which temporal context was properly localized and all sentences.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On our model, performance on all three temporal word types increases when the context moment can be properly localized.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"When considering global context, performance on “before” and “after” actually decreases, suggesting global context does not understand temporal reasoning well.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, even when the context is correctly localized, there is still ample room for improvement on all three sentence types motivating future work on temporal reasoning for moment retrieval.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Results: TEMPO - HL.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Table 6 compares performance on TEMPO - HL.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We compare our bestperforming model from training on the TEMPOTL (strongly supervised MLLC and conTEF) to prior work (MCN and TALL) and to MLLC with global and before/after context.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Performance on TEMPO-HL is considerably lower than TEMPOTL suggesting that TEMPO-HL is harder than TEMPO-TL.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On TEMPO - HL, we observe similar trends as on TEMPO-TL.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"When considering all sentence
types, MLLC has the best performance across all metrics.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In particular, our model has the strongest performance for all sentence types considering the mIoU metric.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In addition to performing better on temporal words, our model also performs better on the original DiDeMo dataset.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"As was seen in TEMPO-TL, including before/after context performs better than our model trained with global context for both “before” and “after” words.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
The final row of Table 6 shows an upper bound in which the ground truth context is used at test time instead of the latent context.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We note that results improve for “before”, “after”, and “then”, suggesting that learning to better localize context will improve results for these sentence types.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Localizing Context Fragments.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"TEMPO-HL sentences can be broken into two parts: a basesentence fragment (which refers to the base moment), and a context-sentence fragment (which refers to the context moment).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For example, for the sentence “The girl holds the ball before throwing it,”, “the girl holds the ball” is the base fragment and “throwing it” is the context fragment.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"A majority of the “before” and “after” sentences in TEMPO-HL are of the form “X before (or after) Y ”, so we can determine a list of sentence fragments by splitting sentences based on the temporal word.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Given “before” and “after” sentences, we determine the ground truth context fragment by considering which reference moment was given to annotators.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
We can then measure how well models localize context fragments.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Table 7 compares two approaches to localizing context fragments: inputting just the context fragment into MLLC

"We find that our model reliably selects the correct context fragments, most likely because it can properly exploit temporal understanding of how the context fragment relates to the base fragment.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
Visualizing Context.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In addition to a localized query, we can also visualize which context moment the temporal query refers to.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Figure 4 shows predicted moments and their corresponding con-
text moments.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For the query “The girl with a hat takes a drink before the girl without a hat waves”, the little girl in the hat drinks twice, but our model correctly localizes the time she drinks before the other girl waves.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Likewise, for the moment “After zooming in to the dog, the dog darts across the grass and into the woods”, the dog darts towards the woods twice (at the beginning of the video and at the end).",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our model properly localizes the moment when the dog runs towards the forest the second time as well as the context fragment “zooming in on dog” when localizing the moment.
",5 Experiments,[0],[0]

In recent years the subject of private hypothesis testing has been receiving increasing attention (see Related Work below).,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, by and large, the focus of private hypothesis testing is in the centralized model (or the curated model), where a single trusted entity holds the sensitive details of n users and runs the private hypothesis tester on the actual data.

"In contrast, the subject of this work is private hypothesis testing in the local-model (or the distributed model), where a -differentially private mechanism is applied independently to each datum.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This model, which alleviates trust (each user can run the mechanism independently on her own and release the noisy signal from the mechanism), has gained much popularity in recent years, especially since it was adopted by Google’s Rappor (Erlingsson et al., 2014) and Apple (Apple, 2017).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"And yet, despite its popularity, and the fact that recent works (Bassily & Smith, 2015; Bassily et al., 2017) have shown the space of possible locally-private mechanism is richer than what was originally thought, little is known about private hypothesis testing in the local-model.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We view the local differentially private model as a signaling scheme.,1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
Each datum / user has a type x taken from a predefined and publicly known set of possible types X whose size is T = |X |.,1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"The differentially private mechanism is merely a randomized function M : ([n],X ) → S, mapping each possible type X of the i-th datum to some set of possible signals S, which we assume to be -differentially private: for any index",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"i, any pair of types x, x′ ∈ X and any signal s ∈ S",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"it holds that Pr[M(i, x) = s] ≤ e Pr[M(i, x′) = s].1 In our most general results (Theorems 1 and 9), we ignore the fact thatM is -differentially private, and just refer to any signaling scheme that transforms one domain (namely, X ) into another (S).",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"For example, a surveyer might unify rarely occurring types under the category of “other”, or perhaps users report their types over noisy channels, etc.
",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"We differentiate between two types of signaling schemes: the symmetric (or index-oblivious) variety, and the nonsymmetric (index-aware) type.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
A local signaling mechanism is called symmetric if it is independent of the index of the datum.,1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"Namely, if for any i 6=",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"j we have that M(i, x) = M(j, x) def= M(x).",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"A classic exam-
1For simplicity, we assume S, the set of possible signals, is discrete.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
Note that this doesn’t exclude mechanisms such as adding Gaussian/Gamma noise to a point in Rd — such mechanisms require X to be some bounded subset of Rd and use the bound to set the noise appropriately.,1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the standard approach of discretizing X and projecting the noisy point to the closest point in the grid yields a finite set of signals S.
ple of such a mechanism is randomized-response — that actually dates back to before differential privacy was defined (Warner, 1965) and was first put to use in differential privacy in (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) — where each user / datum x draws her own signal from the set S = X skewing the probability ever-so-slightly in favor of the original type.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"I.e. if the user’s type is x then
M(x) =
{ x, w.p. e
T−1+e
x′, for any other x′ w.p. 1T−1+e .
",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"The utility of the above-mentioned symmetric mechanism scales polynomially with T (or rather, with |S|), which motivated the question of designing local mechanisms with error scaling logarithmically in T .",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"This question was recently answered in the affirmative by the works of Bassily and Smith (2015) and Bassily et al (2017), whose mechanisms are not symmetric.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"In fact, both of them work by presenting each user i with a mapping fi : X → S (the mapping itself is chosen randomly, but it is public, so we treat it as a given), and the user then runs the standard randomized response mechanism on the signals using fi(x) as the more-likely signal.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"(In fact, in both schemes, S = {1,−1}: in (Bassily & Smith, 2015) fi is merely the j-th coordinate of a hashing of the types where j and the hashing function are publicly known, and in (Bassily et al., 2017) fi maps a u.a.r chosen subset of X to 1 and its complementary to −1.2)",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"So given fi, the user then tosses her own private random coins to determine what signal she broadcasts.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"Therefore, each user’s mechanism can be summarized in a |S| × |X |-matrix, where Mi(s, x) is the probability a user of type x sends the signal s.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"For example, using the mechanism of (Bassily et al., 2017), each user whose type maps to 1 sends “signal 1” with probability e
1+e and “signal −1” with probability 1 1+e .",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
"Namely, Mi(fi(x), x) = e 1+e andMi(−fi(x), x) = 1
1+e , where fi is the mapping X → {1,−1} set for user i.",1.1. Background: Local Differential Privacy,[0],[0]
This work initiates (to the best of our knowledge) the theory of differentially private hypothesis testing in the local model.,1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
First we survey related work and preliminaries.,1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"Then, in Section 3, we examine the symmetric case and show that any mechanism (not necessarily a differentially private one) yields a distribution on the signals for which finding a maximum-likelihood hypothesis is feasible, assuming the set of possible hypotheses is convex.",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"Then, focusing on the classic randomized-response mechanism, we show that the problem of maximizing the likelihood of the observed signals is strongly-convex and thus simpler than the original problem.",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"More importantly, in essence
2In both works, much effort is put to first reducing T to the most frequent √ n types, and then run the counting algorithm.",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"Regardless, the end-counts / collection of users’ signals are the ones we care for the sake of hypothesis testing.
",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
we give a characterization of hypothesis testing under randomized response: the symmetric locally-private mechanism translates the original null hypothesis,1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
H0 (and the alternative H1) by a known affine translation into a different set ϕ(H0) (and resp. ϕ(H1)).,1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"Hence, hypothesis testing under randomized-response boils to discerning between two different (and considerably closer in total-variation distance) sets, but in the exact same model as in standard hypothesis testing as all signals were drawn from the same hypothesis in ϕ(H0).",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
As an immediate corollary we give bounds on identity-testing (Corollary 5) and independencetesting (Theorem 6) under randomized-response.,1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
(The latter requires some manipulations and far less straightforward than the former.),1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"The sample complexity (under certain simplifying assumptions) of both problems is proportional to T 2.5.
",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
In Section 4 we move to the non-symmetric local-model.,1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"Again, we start with a general result showing that in this case too, finding an hypothesis that maximizes the likelihood of the observed signals is feasible when the hypothesis-set is convex.",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
We then focus on the mechanism of Bassily et al (2017) and show that it also makes the problem of finding a maximum-likelihood hypothesis strongly-convex.,1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"We then give a simple identity tester under this scheme whose sample complexity is proportional to T 2, and is thus more efficient than any tester under standard randomized-response.",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"Similarly, we also give an independence-tester with a similar sample complexity.",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"In Section 4.2 we empirically investigate alternative identitytesting and independence-testing based on Pearson’s χ2test in this non-symmetric scheme, and identify a couple of open problems in this regime.",1.2. Our Contribution and Organization,[0],[0]
"Several works have looked at the intersection of differential privacy and statistics (Dwork & Lei, 2009; Smith, 2011; Chaudhuri & Hsu, 2012; Duchi et al., 2013a; Dwork et al., 2015) mostly focusing on robust statistics; but only a handful of works study rigorously the significance and power of hypotheses testing under differential privacy.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
Vu and Slavkovic (2009) looked at the sample size for privately testing the bias of a coin.,1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Johnson and Shmatikov (2013), Uhler et al (2013) and Yu et al (2014) focused on the Pearson χ2-test (the simplest goodness of fit test), showing that the noise added by differential privacy vanishes asymptotically as the number of datapoints goes to infinity, and propose a private χ2-based test which they study empirically.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wang et al (2015) and Gaboardi et al (2016) who have noticed the issues with both of these approaches, have revised the statistical tests themselves to incorporate also the added noise in the private computation.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Cai et al (2017) give a private identity tester based on noisy χ2-test over large bins, Sheffet (2017) studies private Ordinary Least Squares using the JL transform, and Karwa and Vadhan (2018) give
matching upper- and lower-bounds on the confidence intervals for the mean of a population.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"All of these works however deal with the centralized-model of differential privacy.
",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
Perhaps the closest to our work are the works of Duchi et al (2013a; 2013b) who give matching upper- and lowerbound on robust estimators in the local model.,1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"And while their lower bounds do inform as to the sample complexity’s dependency on −2, they do not ascertain the sample complexity dependency on the size of the domain (T ) we get in Section 3.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, these works disregard independence testing (and in fact (Duchi et al., 2013b) focus on mean estimation so they apply randomized-response to each feature independently generating a product-distribution even when the input isn’t sampled from a product-distribution).",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]
"And so, to the best of our knowledge, no work has focused on hypothesis testing in the local model, let alone in the (relatively new) non-symmetric local model.",1.3. Related Work,[0],[0]

We show that several simple techniques give rise to an algorithm which is superior to previous logarithmic time classification approaches while competing with one-against-all in space.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"The core construction is based on using a tree to select a small subset of labels with high recall, which are then scored using a one-against-some structure with high precision.",abstractText,[0],[0]
