"Despite the massive success brought by neural machine translation (NMT, Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017), it has been noticed that the vanilla NMT often lags behind conventional machine translation systems, such as statistical phrase-based translation systems (PBMT, Koehn et al., 2003), for low-resource language pairs (see, e.g., Koehn and Knowles, 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the past few years, various approaches have been proposed to address this issue.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"It was later followed by approaches based on multilingual translation, in which the goal was to exploit knowledge from high-resource language pairs by training a single NMT system on a mix of high-resource and low-resource language pairs (Firat et al., 2016a,b; Lee et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016b).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Its variant, transfer learning, was also proposed by Zoph et al. (2016), in which an NMT system is pretrained on a high-resource language pair before being finetuned on a target low-resource language pair.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we follow up on these latest approaches based on multilingual NMT and propose a meta-learning algorithm for low-resource neural machine translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We start by arguing that the recently proposed model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML, Finn et al., 2017) could be applied to low-resource machine translation by viewing language pairs as separate tasks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This view enables us to use MAML to find the initialization of model parameters that facilitate fast adaptation for a new language pair with a minimal amount of training examples (§3).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, the vanilla MAML however cannot handle tasks with mismatched input and output.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We overcome this limitation by incorporating the universal lexical representation (Gu et al., 2018b) and adapting it for the meta-learning scenario (§3.3).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We extensively evaluate the effectiveness and generalizing ability of the proposed meta-learning algorithm on low-resource neural machine translation.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We utilize 17 languages from Europarl and Russian from WMT as the source tasks and test the meta-learned parameter initialization against five target languages (Ro, Lv, Fi, Tr and Ko), in all cases translating to English.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our experiments using only up to 160k tokens in each of the target task reveal that the proposed meta-learning approach outperforms the multilingual translation
approach across all the target language pairs, and the gap grows as the number of training examples decreases.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Neural Machine Translation (NMT),2 Background,[0],[0]
"Given a source sentence X = {x1, ..., xT 0}, a neural machine translation model factors the distribution over possible output sentences Y = {y1, ..., yT } into a chain of conditional probabilities with a leftto-right causal structure:
p(Y |X; ✓) = T+1Y
t=1
p(yt|y0:t 1, x1:T 0 ; ✓), (1)
where special tokens y0 (hbosi) and yT+1 (heosi) are used to represent the beginning and the end of a target sentence.",2 Background,[0],[0]
These conditional probabilities are parameterized using a neural network.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"Typically, an encoder-decoder architecture (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) with a RNN-based decoder is used.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"More recently, architectures without any recurrent structures (Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017) have been proposed and shown to speed up training while achieving state-of-the-art performance.
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Low Resource Translation NMT is known to easily over-fit and result in an inferior performance when the training data is limited (Koehn and Knowles, 2017).",2 Background,[0],[0]
"In general, there are two ways for handling the problem of low resource translation: (1) utilizing the resource of unlabeled monolingual data, and (2) sharing the knowledge between low- and high-resource language pairs.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Many research efforts have been spent on incorporating the monolingual corpora into machine translation, such as multi-task learning (Gulcehre et al., 2015; Zhang and Zong, 2016), back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2015), dual learning (He et al., 2016) and unsupervised machine translation with monolingual corpora only for both sides (Artetxe et al., 2017b; Lample et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018).
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"For the second approach, prior researches have worked on methods to exploit the knowledge of auxiliary translations, or even auxiliary tasks.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"For instance, Cheng et al. (2016); Chen et al. (2017); Lee et al. (2017); Chen et al. (2018) investigate the use of a pivot to build a translation path between two languages even without any directed resource.",2 Background,[0],[0]
The pivot can be a third language or even an image in multimodal domains.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"When pivots are
not easy to obtain, Firat et al. (2016a); Lee et al. (2016); Johnson et al. (2016) have shown that the structure of NMT is suitable for multilingual machine translation.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Gu et al. (2018b) also showed that such a multilingual NMT system could improve the performance of low resource translation by using a universal lexical representation to share embedding information across languages.
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"All the previous work for multilingual NMT assume the joint training of multiple high-resource languages naturally results in a universal space (for both the input representation and the model) which, however, is not necessarily true, especially for very low resource cases.
",2 Background,[0.9501730700055744],"['Available for dozens of languages, each dataset contains 64-dimension embeddings for the 100,000 most frequent words in a language’s training corpus (of variable size), as well as an UNK embedding to be used for OOV words.']"
"Meta Learning In the machine learning community, meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, has recently received interests.",2 Background,[0],[0]
Meta-learning tries to solve the problem of “fast adaptation on new training data.”,2 Background,[0],[0]
"One of the most successful applications of meta-learning has been on few-shot (or oneshot) learning (Lake et al., 2015), where a neural network is trained to readily learn to classify inputs based on only one or a few training examples.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"There are two categories of meta-learning:
1.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"learning a meta-policy for updating model parameters (see, e.g., Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016a; Mishra et al., 2017)
2.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"learning a good parameter initialization for fast adaptation (see, e.g., Finn et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017).
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose to use a meta-learning algorithm for low-resource neural machine translation based on the second category.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"More specifically, we extend the idea of model-agnostic metalearning (MAML, Finn et al., 2017) in the multilingual scenario.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"The underlying idea of MAML is to use a set of source tasks T 1, . . .",3 Meta Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]

",3 Meta Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"That is, we meta-learn the initialization from auxiliary tasks and continue to learn the target task.",3 Meta Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
We refer the proposed meta-learning method for NMT to MetaNMT.,3 Meta Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
See Fig. 1 for the overall illustration.,3 Meta Learning for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Given any initial parameters ✓0 (which can be either random or meta-learned),
the prior distribution of the parameters of a desired NMT model can be defined as an isotropic Guassian:
✓i ⇠ N (✓0i , 1/ ),
where 1/ is a variance.",3.1 Learn: language-specific learning,[0],[0]
"With this prior distribution, we formulate the language-specific learning process Learn(DT ; ✓0) as maximizing the logposterior of the model parameters given data DT :

The first term above corresponds to the maximum likelihood criterion often used for training a usual NMT system.,3.1 Learn: language-specific learning,[0],[0]
"The second term discourages the newly learned model from deviating too much from the initial parameters, alleviating the issue of overfitting when there is not enough training data.",3.1 Learn: language-specific learning,[0],[0]
"In practice, we solve the problem above by maximizing the first term with gradient-based optimization and early-stopping after only a few update steps.
",3.1 Learn: language-specific learning,[0],[0]
"Thus, in the low-resource scenario, finding a good initialization ✓0 strongly correlates the final performance of the resulting model.",3.1 Learn: language-specific learning,[0],[0]
"We find the initialization ✓0 by repeatedly simulating low-resource translation scenarios using auxiliary, high-resource language pairs.",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]

"We maximize the meta-objective function using stochastic approximation (Robbins and Monro, 1951) with gradient descent.",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"For each episode, we uniformly sample one source task at random, T k.",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"We then sample two subsets of training examples independently from the chosen task, DT k and D0T k .",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
We use the former to simulate languagespecific learning and the latter to evaluate its outcome.,3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]

It is however a good starting point for training a good model using only a few steps of learning.,3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]

"Related Work: Multilingual Transfer Learning The proposed MetaNMT differs from the existing framework of multilingual translation (Lee et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2018b) or transfer learning (Zoph et al., 2016).",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]

"The target low-resource language pair could either be a part of joint training or be trained separately starting from the solution ✓0 found from solving the above problem.
",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"The major difference between the proposed MetaNMT and these multilingual transfer approaches is that the latter do not consider how learning happens with the target, low-resource language pair.",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
The former explicitly incorporates the learning process within the framework by simulating it repeatedly in Eq.,3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
(2).,3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"As we will see later in the experiments, this results in a substantial gap in the final performance on the low-resource task.
",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"Illustration In Fig. 2, we contrast transfer learning, multilingual learning and meta-learning using three source language pairs (Fr-En, Es-En and Pt-En) and two target pairs (Ro-En and Lv-En).",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"Transfer learning trains an NMT system specifically for a source language pair (Es-En) and finetunes the system for each target language pair (RoEn, Lv-En).",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"Multilingual learning often trains a single NMT system that can handle many different language pairs (Fr-En, Pt-En, Es-En), which may or may not include the target pairs (Ro-En, LvEn).",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"If not, it finetunes the system for each target pair, similarly to transfer learning.",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
Both of these however aim at directly solving the source tasks.,3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, meta-learning trains the NMT system to be useful for fine-tuning on various tasks including the source and target tasks.",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
"This is done by repeatedly simulating the learning process on
low-resource languages using many high-resource language pairs (Fr-En, Pt-En, Es-En).",3.2 MetaLearn,[0],[0]
I/O mismatch across language pairs One major challenge that limits applying meta-learning for low resource machine translation is that the approach outlined above assumes the input and output spaces are shared across all the source and target tasks.,3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"This, however, does not apply to machine translation in general due to the vocabulary mismatch across different languages.",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"In multilingual translation, this issue has been tackled by using a vocabulary of sub-words (Sennrich et al., 2015) or characters (Lee et al., 2016) shared across multiple languages.",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"This surface-level sharing is however limited, as it cannot be applied to languages exhibiting distinct orthography (e.g., IndoEuroepan languages vs. Korean.)
",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"Universal Lexical Representation (ULR) We tackle this issue by dynamically building a vocabulary specific to each language using a keyvalue memory network (Miller et al., 2016; Gulcehre et al., 2018), as was done successfully for low-resource machine translation recently by Gu et al. (2018b).",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"We start with multilingual word embedding matrices ✏kquery 2 R|Vk|⇥d pretrained on large monolingual corpora, where Vk is the vocabulary of the k-th language.",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"These embedding vectors can be obtained with small dictionaries of seed word pairs (Artetxe et al., 2017a; Smith et al., 2017) or in a fully unsupervised manner (Zhang et al., 2017; Conneau et al., 2018).",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"We take one of these languages k0 to build universal lexical representation consisting of a universal embedding matrix ✏u 2 RM⇥d and a corresponding key matrix ✏key 2 RM⇥d, where M < |V 0k|.",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
Both ✏kquery and ✏key are fixed during meta-learning.,3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"We then compute the language-specific embedding of token x from the language k as the convex sum of the universal embedding vectors by

"This approach allows us to handle languages with different vocabularies using a fixed number of shared parameters (✏u, ✏key and A.)
",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"Learning of ULR It is not desirable to update the universal embedding matrix ✏u when fine-
tuning on a small corpus which contains a limited set of unique tokens in the target language, as it could adversely influence the other tokens’ embedding vectors.",3.3 Unified Lexical Representation,[0],[0]
"We thus estimate the change to each embedding vector induced by languagespecific learning by a separate parameter ✏k[x]:
✏k[x] = ✏0[x] + ✏k[x].

"Impact of Validation Tasks Similarly to training any other neural network, meta-learning still requires early-stopping to avoid overfitting to a
specific set of source tasks.",5 Results,[0],[0]
"In doing so, we observe that the choice of a validation task has nonnegligible impact on the final performance.",5 Results,[0],[0]

"Although the impact of adding more source tasks varies from one language to another, there is up to 2⇥ improvement going from one source task to 18 source tasks (Lv-En, Fi-En, Tr-En and Ko-En).",5 Results,[0],[0]
"The same trend can be observed even without any fine-tuning (i.e., unsupervised translation, (Lample et al., 2017; Artetxe et al., 2017b)).",5 Results,[0],[0]
"In addition, the choice of source languages has different implications for different target languages.",5 Results,[0],[0]

"For the rest of this section, we first present the construction of L andNLL(C |Θ) in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
We then discuss how these two components can be mutually informed by each other in Section 3.3.,3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Finally, the generative process and parameter learning are described in Section 3.4.
3.1 Reply Preference (L) Our user reply preference modeling is built on the success of collaborative filtering (CF) for product ratings.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"However, classic CF problems, such as product recommendation, generally rely on explicit user feedback.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Unlike user ratings on products, our input lacks explicit feedback from users about negative preferences and nonresponse.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we follow one-class Collaborative Filtering (Hu et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2008),
which weights positive instances higher during training and is thus suited to our data.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Formally, for user u and conversation c, we measure reply preference based on the MSE between predicted preference score pu,c and reply history ru,c. ru,c equals 1 if u is in the conversation history; otherwise, it is 0.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]

γUu and γ C c are K-dimensional latent vectors that encode topic-specific information (where K is the number of latent topics) for users and conversations.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Specifically, γUu reflects the topical interests of u, with higher value γUu,k indicating greater interest by u in topic k. γCc captures the extents that topics are discussed in conversation c.
Similarly, D-dimensional vectors δUu and δ C c capture discourse structures in shaping reply behaviors (where D is the number of discourse clusters).",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"δUu reflects the discourse behaviors u prefers, such as u1 often enjoys arguments as in the second conversation of Figure 1, while δCc captures the discourse modes used throughout conversation c. By multiplying user and conversation factors, we can measure the corresponding similarity.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"The predicted score pu,c thereby reflects the tendency for a user u to be involved in conversation c.
As pointed out by McAuley and Leskovec (2013), these latent vectors often encode hidden factors that are hard to interpret under a CF framework.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Therefore, in Section 3.2, we present a novel probabilistic model which can extract interpretable topics and discourse modes as word
distributions.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]

Here we present a novel probabilistic model that learns coherent word distributions for latent topics and discourse modes of conversations.,3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Formally, we assume that each conversation c ∈ C contains Mc messages, and each message m has Nc,m words.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"We distinguish three latent components – discourse, topic, and background – underlying conversations, each with their own type of word distribution.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"At the corpus level, there are K topics represented by word distribution φTk (k = 1, 2, ...,K), while φDd (d = 1, 2, ..., D) represents the D discourse modes embedded in corpus.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"In addition, we add a background word distribution φB to capture general information (e.g., common words), which do not indicate either discourse or topic information.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"φDd , φ T k , and φ
B are all multinomial word distributions over vocabulary size V .",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]

Message-level Modeling.,3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Our model assigns two types of message-level multinomial variables to each message: zc,m reflects its latent topic and dc,m represents its discourse mode.
",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
Topic assignments.,3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Due to the short nature of microblog posts, we assume each message m in conversation c contains only one topic, indexed as zc,m. This strategy has been proven useful to alleviate data sparsity for topic inference (Quan et al., 2015).",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
We further assume messages in the same conversation would focus on similar topics.,3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"We thus draw topic zc,m ∼ θc, where θc denotes the fractions of topics discussed in conversation c.
Discourse assignments.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]

fall into one of the three types: discourse, topic, and background.

Discourse words (DISC) are indicative of the discourse modes of messages.,3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]

Topic words (TOPIC) describe the topical focus of a conversation.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"When xc,m,n = TOPIC, wc,m,n is assigned as a topic word and generated from φTzc,m – word distribution given topic of m.
Background words (BACK) capture the general information that is not related to discourse or topic.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"When word wc,m,n is assigned as a background word (xc,m,n = BACK), it is drawn from background distribution φB .
",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Switching among Topic, Discourse, and Background.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"We further assume the word type switcher xc,m,n is sampled from a multinomial distribution which depends on the current discourse mode dc,m. The intuition is that messages of different discourse modes may show different distributions of the three word types.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"For instance, a statement message may contain more content words than a rhetorical question.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]
"Specifically, xc,m,n ∼ Multi(τdc,m), where τd is a 3-dimension stochastic vector that expresses the appearing probabilities of three kinds of words (DISC, TOPIC, BACK), when the discourse assignment is d. Stop words and punctuations are forced to be labeled as discourse or background.",3 The Joint Model of Topic and Discourse for Recommendation,[0],[0]

"Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 102–112 Copenhagen, Denmark, September 7–11, 2017. c©2017 Association for Computational Linguistics",text,[0],[0]
"One of the key advantages of word embeddings for natural language processing is that they enable generalization to words that are unseen in labeled training data, by embedding lexical features from large unlabeled datasets into a relatively low-dimensional Euclidean space.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These low-dimensional embeddings are typically trained to capture distributional similarity, so that information can be shared among words that tend to appear in similar contexts.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, it is not possible to enumerate the entire vocabulary of any language, and even large unlabeled datasets will miss terms that appear in later applications.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The issue of how to handle these out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words poses challenges for embedding-based methods.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These challenges are particularly acute when working with lowresource languages, where even unlabeled data may be difficult to obtain at scale.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A typical solution is to abandon hope, by assigning a single OOV embedding to all terms that do not appear in the unlabeled data.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We approach this challenge from a quasigenerative perspective.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Knowing nothing of a word except for its embedding and its written form, we attempt to learn the former from the latter.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) on the character level with the embedding as the target, and use it later to predict vectors for OOV words in any downstream task.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We call this model the MIMICK-RNN, for its ability to read a word’s spelling and mimick its distributional embedding.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Through nearest-neighbor analysis, we show that vectors learned via this method capture both word-shape features and lexical features.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, we obtain reasonable near-neighbors for OOV abbreviations, names, novel compounds, and orthographic errors.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Quantitative evaluation on the Stanford RareWord dataset (Luong et al., 2013) provides more evidence that these character-based embeddings capture word similarity for rare and unseen words.

"As an extrinsic evaluation, we conduct experiments on joint prediction of part-of-speech tags and morphosyntactic attributes for a diverse set of 23 languages, as provided in the Universal Dependencies dataset (De Marneffe et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model shows significant improvement
102
across the board against a single UNK-embedding backoff method, and obtains competitive results against a supervised character-embedding model, which is trained end-to-end on the target task.",1 Introduction,[1.000000027151479],"['Our model shows significant improvement 102 across the board against a single UNK-embedding backoff method, and obtains competitive results against a supervised character-embedding model, which is trained end-to-end on the target task.']"
"In low-resource settings, our approach is particularly effective, and is complementary to supervised character embeddings trained from labeled data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The MIMICK-RNN therefore provides a useful new tool for tagging tasks in settings where there is limited labeled data.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

Compositional models for embedding rare and unseen words.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Several studies make use of morphological or orthographic information when training word embeddings, enabling the prediction of embeddings for unseen words based on their internal structure.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Botha and Blunsom (2014) compute word embeddings by summing over embeddings of the morphemes; Luong et al. (2013) construct a recursive neural network over each word’s morphological parse; Bhatia et al. (2016) use morpheme embeddings as a prior distribution over probabilistic word embeddings.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"While morphology-based approaches make use of meaningful linguistic substructures, they struggle with names and foreign language words, which include out-of-vocabulary morphemes.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Character-based approaches avoid these problems: for example, Kim et al. (2016) train a recurrent neural network over words, whose embeddings are constructed by convolution over character embeddings; Wieting et al. (2016) learn embeddings of character ngrams, and then sum them into word embeddings.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In all of these cases, the model for composing embeddings of subword units into word embeddings is learned by optimizing an objective over a large unlabeled corpus.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, our approach is a post-processing step that can be applied to any set of word embeddings, regardless of how they were trained.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This is similar to the “retrofitting” approach of Faruqui et al. (2015), but rather than smoothing embeddings over a graph, we learn a function to build embeddings compositionally.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Supervised subword models.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Another class of methods learn task-specific character-based word embeddings within end-to-end supervised systems.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, Santos and Zadrozny (2014) build word embeddings by convolution over char-
acters, and then perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging using a local classifier; the tagging objective drives the entire learning process.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Ling et al. (2015) propose a multi-level long shortterm memory (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), in which word embeddings are built compositionally from an LSTM over characters, and then tagging is performed by an LSTM over words.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Plank et al. (2016) show that concatenating a character-level or bit-level LSTM network to a word representation helps immensely in POS tagging.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Because these methods learn from labeled data, they can cover only as much of the lexicon as appears in their labeled training sets.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As we show, they struggle in several settings: lowresource languages, where labeled training data is scarce; morphologically rich languages, where the number of morphemes is large, or where the mapping from form to meaning is complex; and in Chinese, where the number of characters is orders of magnitude larger than in non-logographic scripts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, supervised subword models can be combined with MIMICK, offering additive improvements.

Morphosyntactic attribute tagging.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We evaluate our method on the task of tagging word tokens for their morphosyntactic attributes, such as gender, number, case, and tense.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The task of morpho-syntactic tagging dates back at least to the mid 1990s (Oflazer and Kuruöz, 1994; Hajič and Hladká, 1998), and interest has been rejuvenated by the availability of large-scale multilingual morphosyntactic annotations through the Universal Dependencies (UD) corpus (De Marneffe et al., 2014).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, Faruqui et al. (2016) propose a graph-based technique for propagating typelevel morphological information across a lexicon, improving token-level morphosyntactic tagging in 11 languages, using an SVM tagger.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, we apply a neural sequence labeling approach, inspired by the POS tagger of Plank et al. (2016).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
