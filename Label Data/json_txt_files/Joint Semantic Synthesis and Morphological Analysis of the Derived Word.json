The output segmentation has been shown to aid a diverse set of applications, such as automatic speech recognition (Afify et al., 2006), keyword spotting (Narasimhan et al., 2014), machine translation (Clifton and Sarkar, 2011) and parsing (Seeker and C\u0327etinog\u0306lu, 2015).

This work addresses the question of structural decomposition and semantic synthesis in the general framework of distributional semantics.\n2Morphological research in theoretical and computational linguistics often focuses on noncompositional or less compositional phenomena\u2014simply because compositional derivation poses fewer interesting research problems. It is also true that\u2014just as many frequent multiword units are not completely compositional\u2014many frequent derivations (e.g., refusal, fitness) are not completely compositional. An indication that nonlexicalized derivations are usually compositional is the fact that standard dictionaries like OUP editors (2010) list derivational affixes with their compositional meaning, without a hedge that they can also occur as part of only partially compositional forms.

For the example questionably, our model can restore the deleted characters le, yielding the canonical segments question, able and ly. In this work, our primary contribution lies in the integration of continuous semantic vectors into supervised morphological segmentation\u2014 we present a joint model of morphological analysis and semantic synthesis at the word-level.\nWe experimentally investigate three novel aspects of our model.\n\u2022 First, we show that jointly modeling continuous representations of the semantics of morphemes and words allows us to improve morphological analysis. On the English portion of CELEX (Baayen et al., 1993), we achieve a 5 point improvement in segmentation accuracy and a 3 point improvement in morpheme F1. On the German DErivBase dataset we achieve a 3 point improvement in segmentation accuracy and a 3 point improvement in morpheme F1.\n\u2022 Second, we explore improved models of vector composition for synthesizing word meaning. We find a recurrent neural network improves over previously proposed additive models. Moreover, we find that more syntactically oriented vectors (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a) are better suited for morphology than bag-ofword (BOW) models.\n\u2022 Finally, we explore the productivity of English derivational affixes in the context of distributional semantics."}, {"heading": "2 Derivational Morphology", "text": "Two important goals of morphology, the linguistic study of the internal structure of words, are to describe the relation between different words in the lexicon and to decompose them into morphemes, the smallest linguistic unit bearing meaning. Morphology can be divided into two types: inflectional and derivational. Inflectional morphology is the set of processes through which the word form outwardly\ndisplays syntactic information, e.g., verb tense. It follows that an inflectional affix typically neither changes the part-of-speech (POS) nor the semantics of the word. For example, the English verb to run takes various forms: run, runs, ran and running, all of which convey \u201cmoving by foot quickly\u201d, but appear in complementary syntactic contexts.\nDerivation deals with the formation of new words that have semantic shifts in meaning (often including POS) and is tightly intertwined with lexical semantics (Light, 1996). Consider the example of the English noun discontentedness, which is derived from the adjective discontented. It is true that both words share a close semantic relationship, but the transformation is clearly more than a simple inflectional marking of syntax. Indeed, we can go one step further and define a chain of words content 7\u2192 contented 7\u2192 discontented 7\u2192 discontentedness.\nIn the computational literature, derivational morphology has received less attention than inflectional. There are, however, two bodies of work on derivation in computational linguistics. First, there is a series of papers that explore the relation between lexical semantics and derivation (Lazaridou et al., 2013; Zeller et al., 2014; Pado\u0301 et al., 2015; Kisselew et al., 2015). All of these assume a gold morphological analysis and primarily focus on the effect of derivation on distributional semantics. The second body of work, e.g., the unsupervised morphological segmenter MORFESSOR (Creutz and Lagus, 2007), does not deal with semantics and makes no distinction between inflectional and derivational morphology.3 Even though the boundary between inflectional and derivational morphology is a continuum rather than a rigid divide (Haspelmath and Sims, 2013), there is still the clear distinction that derivation changes meaning whereas inflection does not. Our goal in this paper is to develop an account of how the meaning of a word form can be computed jointly, combining these two lines of work.\nProductivity and Semantic Coherence. We highlight two related issues in derivation that motivated the development of our model: productivity\n3Narasimhan et al. (2015) also make no distinction between inflectional and derivational morphology, but their model is an exception in that it includes vector similarity as a semantic feature. See \u00a75 for discussion.\nand semantic coherence. Roughly, a productive affix is one that can still actively be employed to form new words in a language. For example, the English nominalizing affix ness (red7\u2192red+ness) can be attached to just about any adjective, including novel forms. In contrast, the archaic English nominalizing affix th (dear7\u2192dear+th, heal7\u2192heal+th, steal7\u2192steal+th) does not allow us to form new words such as cheapth. This is a crucial issue in derivational morphology since we would not in general want to analyze new words as having been formed from non-productive endings; e.g., we do not want to analyze hearth as hear+th (or wugth as wug+th). Relations such as those between heal and health are lexicalized since they no longer can be derived by productive processes (Bauer, 1983).\nUnder a generative treatment (Chomsky, 1965) of morphology, productivity becomes a central notion since a grammar needs to account for active word formation processes in the language (Aronoff, 1976). Defining productivity precisely, however, is tricky; Aronoff (1976) writes, \u201cone of the central mysteries of derivational morphology . . . [is that] . . . though many things are possible in morphology, some are more possible than others.\u201d Nevertheless, speakers often have clear intuitions about which affixes in the language are productive.4\nRelated to productivity is the notion of semantic coherence. The principle of compositionality (Frege, 1892; Heim and Kratzer, 1998) applies to interpretation of words just as it does to phrases. Indeed, compositionality is often taken to be a signal for productivity (Aronoff, 1976). When deciding whether to further decompose a word, asking whether the parts sum up to the whole is often a good indicator. In the case of questionably 7\u2192 question+able+ly, the compositional meaning is \u201cin a manner that could be questioned\u201d, which corresponds to the meaning of the word. Contrast this with the word unquiet, which means \u201crestless\u201d, rather than \u201cnot quiet\u201d and the compound blackmail, which does not refer to a letter written in black ink.\nThe model we will describe in \u00a73 is a joint model of both semantic coherence and segmentation; that\n4It is also important to distinguish productivity from creativity\u2014a non-rule-governed form of word formation (Lyons, 1977). As an example of creativity, consider the creation of portmanteaux, e.g., dramedy and soundscape.\nis, an analysis is judged not only by character-level features, but also by the degree to which the word is semantically compositional. Implicit in such a treatment is the desire to only segment a word if the segmentation is derived from a productive process. While most prior work on morphological segmentation has not explicitly modeled productivity,5 we believe, from a computational modeling perspective, segmenting only productive affixes is preferable. This is analogous to the modeling of phrase compositionality in embedding models, where it can be better to not further decompose noncompositional multiword units like named entities and idiomatic expressions; see, e.g., Mikolov et al. (2013b), Wang et al. (2014), Yin and Schu\u0308tze (2015), Yaghoobzadeh and Schu\u0308tze (2015), and Hashimoto and Tsuruoka (2016).6\nIn this paper, we refer to the semantic aspect of the model either as semantic synthesis or as coherence. These are two ways of looking at semantics that are related as follows. If the synthesis (i.e., composition) of the meaning of the derived form from the meaning of its parts is a regular application of the linguistic rules of derivation, then the meaning so constructed is coherent. These are the cases where a joint model is expected to be beneficial for both segmentation and interpretation."}, {"heading": "3 A Joint Model", "text": "From an NLP perspective, canonical segmentation (Naradowsky and Goldwater, 2009; Cotterell et al., 2016b) is the task that seeks to algorithmically decompose a word into its canonical sequence of morphemes. It is a version of morphological segmentation that requires the learner to handle orthographic changes that take place during word formation. We believe this is a more natural formulation of morphological analysis\u2014especially for the processing\n5Note that segmenters such as MORFESSOR utilize the principle of minimum description length, which implicitly encodes productivity, in order to guide segmentation.\n6As a reviewer points out, productivity of an affix and semantic coherence of the words formed from it are not perfectly aligned. Nonproductive affixes can produce semantically coherent words, e.g., warm 7\u2192warm+th. Productive affixes can produce semantically incoherent words, e.g., canny 7\u2192un+canny. Again, this is analogous to multiword units. However, there is a strong correlation and our experiments show that relying on it gives good results.\nof derivational morphology\u2014as it draws heavily on linguistic notions (see \u00a72).\nThe main innovation we present is the augmentation of canonical segmentation to take into account semantic coherence and productivity. Consider the word hypercuriosity and its canonical segmentation hyper+curious+ity; this canonical segmentation seeks to decompose the word into its constituent morphemes and account for orthographic changes. This amounts to a structural decomposition of the word, i.e., how do we break up the string of characters into chunks? This is similar to the decomposition of a sentence into a parse tree. However, it is also natural to consider the semantic compositionality of a word, i.e., how is the meaning of the word synthesized from the meaning of the individual morphemes?\nWe consider both of these questions together in a single model, where we would like to place high probability on canonical segmentations that are also semantically coherent. Returning to hypercuriosity, we could further decompose it into hyper+cure+ous+ity in analogy to, say, vice 7\u2192 vicious. Nothing about the surface form of curious alone gives us a strong cue that we should rule out the segmentation cure+ous. Turning to distributional semantics, however, it is the case that the contexts in which curious occurs are quite different from those in which cure occurs. This gives us a strong cue which segmentation is correct.\nFormally, given a word string w \u2208 \u03a3\u2217, where \u03a3 is a discrete alphabet of characters (in English this\ncould be as simple as the 26 letter lowercase alphabet), and a word vector v \u2208 V , where V is a set of low-dimensional word embeddings, we define the model as:\np(v, s, l, u |w)\n= 1\nZ\u03b8(w) exp\n( 1\n2\u03c32 ||v \u2212 C\u03b2(s, l)||22\n+f(s, l, u)>\u03b7 + g(u,w)>\u03c9 ) . (1)\nThis model is composed of three factors: composition factor ( 1\n2\u03c32 ||v\u2212C\u03b2(s, l)||22), segmentation factor\nf and transduction factor g. The parameters of the model are \u03b8 = {\u03b2,\u03b7,\u03c9}, the function C\u03b2 composes morpheme vectors together, s is the segmentation, l is the labeling of the segments, u is the underlying representation and Z\u03b8(w) is the partition function. Note that the conditional distribution p(v | s, l, u, w) is Gaussian distributed by construction. A visualization of our model is found in Figure 1. This model is a conditional random field (CRF) that is mixed, i.e., it is defined over both discrete and continuous random variables (Koller and Friedman, 2009). We restrict the range of u to be a subset of \u03a3|w|+k, where k is an insertion limit (Dreyer, 2011). In this work, we take k = 5. Explicitly, the partition function is defined as\nZ\u03b8(w) =\n\u222b \u2211\nl\u2032,s\u2032,u\u2032 exp\n( 1\n2\u03c32 ||v\u2032 \u2212 C\u03b2(s\u2032, l\u2032)||22\n+ f(s\u2032, l\u2032, u\u2032)>\u03b7 + g(u\u2032, w)>\u03c9 ) dv\u2032, (2)\nwhich is guaranteed to be finite.7\nA CRF is simply the globally renormalized product of several non-negative factors (Sutton and McCallum, 2006).

The aim of this factor is to place high weight on good pairs, e.g., the pair (w=questionably,u=questionablely), so we can accurately restore character-level changes.\nWe encode this portion of the model as a weighted finite-state machine for ease of computation. This factor generalizes probabilistic edit distance (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998) by looking at additional input and output context; see Cotterell et al. (2014) for details. As mentioned above and in contrast to Cotterell et al. (2014), we bound the insertion limit in the edit distance model.8 Computing the score between two strings u and w requires a dynamic program that runs inO(|u|\u00b7|w|). This is a generalization of the forward algorithm for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989).\nWe employ standard feature templates for the task that look at features of edit operations, e.g., substitute i for y, in varying context granularities. See Cotterell et al. (2016b) for details. Recent work has also explored weighting of WFST arcs with scores computed by LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), obviating the need for human selection of feature templates (Rastogi et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Segmentation Factor", "text": "The second factor is the segmentation factor: exp ( f(s, l, u)>\u03b7 ) .

It additionally scores a labeling of the segmentation. Our label set in this work is L = {stem, prefix, suffix}. The proper labeling of the segmentation above is l=question:stem+able:suffix+ly:suffix. The labeling is critical for our composition functions C\u03b2 (Cotterell et al., 2015): which vectors are used depends on the label given to the segment; e.g., the vectors of the prefix \u201cpost\u201d and the stem \u201cpost\u201d are different.\nWe can view this factor as an unnormalized first8As our transduction model is an unnormalized factor in a CRF, we do not require the local normalization discussed in Cotterell et al.

We then conjoin the atomic features with left and right context features as well as the label to create more complex feature templates. We also include transition features that fire on pairs of sequential labels. See Cotterell et al. (2015) for details. Recent work has also showed that a neural parameterization can remove the need for manual feature design (Kong et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Composition Factor", "text": "The composition factor takes the form of an unnormalized multivariate Gaussian density: exp ( 1\n2\u03c32 ||v \u2212 C\u03b2(s, l)||22\n) , where the mean is\ncomputed by the (potentially non-linear) composition function (See Table 1) and the covariance matrix \u03c32I is a diagonal matrix.

See Table 1: each vector mlisi refers to a morpheme-\nspecific, label-dependent embedding. If li = stem, then si represents a stem morpheme.

Count vectors (Salton, 1971; Turney and Pantel, 2010) have been shown to be beneficial in the unsupervised induction of morphology (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001). Embeddings were shown to act similarly (Soricut and Och, 2015). Our method differs from this line of research in two key ways. (i) We present a probabilistic model of the process of synthesizing the word\u2019s meaning from the meaning of its morphemes. Prior work was either not probabilistic or did not explicitly model\nmorphemes. (ii) Our method is supervised and focuses on derivation. Schone and Jurafsky (2000) and Soricut and Och (2015), being fully unsupervised, do not distinguish between inflection and derivation and Schone and Jurafsky (2001) focus on inflection. More recently, Narasimhan et al. (2015) look at the unsupervised induction of \u201cmorphological chains\u201d with semantic vectors as a crucial feature. Their goal is to jointly figure out an ordering of word formation and a morphological segmentation, e.g., play7\u2192playful7\u2192playfulness. While it is a rich model like ours, theirs differs in that it is unsupervised and uses vectors as features, rather than explicitly treating vector composition. All of the above work focuses on surface segmentation and not canonical segmentation, as we do.\nA related line of work that has different goals concerns morphological generation. Two recent papers that address this problem using deep learning are Faruqui et al. (2016a) and Faruqui et al. (2016b). In an older line of work, Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) and Wicentowski (2002) exploit log frequency ratios of inflectionally related forms to tease apart that, e.g., the past tense of sing is not singed, but instead sang. Related work by Dreyer and Eisner (2011) uses a Dirichlet process to model a corpus as a \u201cmixture of a paradigm\u201d, allowing for the semi-supervised incorporation of distributional semantics into a structured model of inflectional paradigm completion.\nOur work is also related to recent attempts to integrate morphological knowledge into general embedding models. For example, Botha and Blunsom (2014) train a log-bilinear language model that models the composition of morphological structure. Likewise, Luong et al. (2013) train a recursive neural network (Goller and Ku\u0308chler, 1996) over a heuristically derived tree structure to learn morphological composition over continuous vectors. Our work is different in that we learn a joint model of segmentation and composition. Moreover, supervised morphological analysis can drastically outperform unsupervised analysis (Ruokolainen et al., 2013).\nEarly work by Kay (1977) can be interpreted as finite-state canonical segmentation, but it neither addresses nor experimentally evaluates the question of joint modeling of morphological analysis and semantic synthesis. Moreover, we may view canoni-\ncalization as an orthographic analogue to phonology.

Finally, we explore the relationship between distributional semantics and morphological productivity.\nFor English, we use the pretrained vectors of Levy and Goldberg (2014a) for all experiments. For German, we train word2vec skip-gram vectors on the German Wikipedia. We first describe our English dataset, the subset of the English portion of the CELEX lexical database (Baayen et al., 1993) that was selected by Lazaridou et al. (2013); the dataset contains 10,000 forms. This allows for comparison with previously proposed methods. We make two modifications. (i) Lazaridou et al. (2013) make the two-morpheme assumption: every word is composed of exactly two morphemes. In general, this is not true, so we further segment all complex\nwords in the corpus. For example, friendless+ness is further segmented into friend+less+ness. To nevertheless allow for fair comparison, we provide versions of our experiments with and without the two-morpheme assumption where appropriate. (ii) Lazaridou et al. (2013) only provide a single train/test split. As we require a held-out development set for hyperparameter tuning, we randomly allocate a portion of the training data to select the hyperparameters and then retrain the model using these parameters on the original train split. We also report 10-fold cross validation results in addition to Lazaridou et al.\u2019s train/test split.\nOur German dataset is taken from Zeller et al. (2013) and is described in Cotterell et al. (2016b). It, again, consists of 10,000 derivational forms. We report results on 10-fold cross validation."}, {"heading": "6.1 Experiment 1: Canonical Segmentation", "text": "For our first experiment, we test whether jointly modeling the continuous representations allows us to segment words more accurately. We assume that we are given an embedding for the target word. We estimate the model p(v, s, l, u | w) as described in \u00a74 with L2 regularization \u03bb||\u03b8||22. To evaluate, we decode the distribution p(s, l, u | v, w). We perform approximate MAP inference with importance sampling\u2014taking the sample with the highest score.\nIn these experiments, we use the RNN with the dependency vectors, the combination of which performs best on vector approximation in \u00a76.2.\nWe follow the experimental design of Cotterell et al. (2016b). We compare against two baselines (marked \u201cBaseline\u201d in Table 2): (i) a \u201cSemiCRF\u201d segmenter that cannot account for orthographic changes and (ii) the full \u201cJoint\u201d model of Cotterell et al. (2016b).13 We additionally consider an \u201cOracle\u201d setting, where we give the model the gold underlying orthographic form (\u201cUR\u201d) at both training and test time. This gives us insight into the performance of the transduction factor of our model, i.e., how much could we benefit from a richer model.\nOur hyperparameters are (i) the regularization coefficient \u03bb and (ii) \u03c32, the variance of the Gaussian factor. We use grid search to tune them: \u03bb \u2208 {0.0, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105}, \u03c32 \u2208 {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}. Metrics. We use three metrics to evaluate segmentation accuracy. Note that the evaluation of canonical segmentation is hard since a system may return a sequence of morphemes whose concatenation is not the same length as the concatenation of the gold morphemes. This rules out metrics for surface segmentation like border F1 (Kurimo et al., 2010), which require the strings to be of the same length.\nWe now define the metrics. (i) Segmentation accuracy measures whether every single canonical morpheme in the returned sequence is correct. It is inflexible: closer answers are penalized the same as\n13i.e., a model without the Gaussian factor that scores vectors.\nmore distant answers. (ii) Morpheme F1 (van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1999) takes the predicted sequence of canonical morphemes, turns it into a set, computes precision and recall in the standard way and based on that then computes F1. This metric gives credit if some of the canonical morphemes were correct. (iii) Levenshtein distance joins the canonical segments with a special symbol # into a single string and computes the Levenshtein distance between predicted and gold strings.\nDiscussion. Results in Table 2 show that jointly modeling semantic coherence improves our ability to analyze words. For test, our proposed joint model (\u201cThis Work\u201d) outperforms the baseline supervised canonical segmenter, which is state-of-the-art for the task, by .05 (resp. .03) on accuracy and .03 (resp. .03) on F1 for English (resp. German). We also find that when we give the joint model an oracle UR the vectors generally help less: .01 (resp. .02) on accuracy and .01 (resp. .03) on F1 for English (resp. German). This indicates that the chief boon the vector composition factor provides lies in selection of an appropriate UR. Moreover, the up to .15 difference in English between systems with and without the oracle UR suggests that reversing orthographic changes is a particularly difficult part of the task, at least for English."}, {"heading": "6.2 Experiment 2: Vector Approximation", "text": "We adopt the experimental design of Lazaridou et al. (2013). Its aim is to approximate a vector of a derivationally complex word using a learned model of composition. As Lazaridou et al. (2013) assume a gold morphological analysis, we compare two settings: (i) oracle morphological analysis and (ii) inferred morphological analysis. To the best of our knowledge, (ii) is a novel experimental condition that no previous work has addressed.\nWe consider four composition models (See Table 1). (i) stem, using just the stem vector. This baseline tells us what happens if we make the incorrect assumption that derivation behaves like inflection and is not meaning-changing. (ii) add, a purely additive model. This is arguably the simplest way of combining the vectors of the morphemes. (iii) LDS, a linear dynamical system. This is arguably the simplest sequence model. (iv) A (simple) RNN. Recur-\nrent neural networks are currently the most widely used nonlinear sequence model and simple RNNs are the simplest such models.\nPart of the motivation for considering a richer class of models lies in our removal of the twomorpheme assumption. Indeed, it is unclear that the wadd and fulladd models (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) are useful models in the general case of multimorphemic words\u2014the weights are tied by position, i.e., the first morpheme\u2019s vector (be it a prefix or stem) is always multiplied by the same matrix.\nComparison with Lazaridou et al. To compare with Lazaridou et al. (2013), we use their exact train/test split. Those results are reported in Table 4. This dataset enforces that all words are composed of\nexactly two morphemes. Thus, a word like unquestionably is segmented as un+questionably, without further decomposition. The vectors employed by Lazaridou et al. (2013) are high-dimensional count vectors derived from lemmatized and POS tagged text with a before-and-after window of size 2. They then apply pointwise mutual information (PMI) weighting and dimensionality reduction by non-negative matrix factorization. In contrast, we employ WORD2VEC (Mikolov et al., 2013a), a model that is also interpretable as the factorization of a PMI matrix (Levy and Goldberg, 2014b). We consider three WORD2VEC models: two bag-of-word (BOW) models with before-and-after windows of size 2 and 5 and DEPs (Levy and Goldberg, 2014a), a dependency-based model whose context is derived from dependency parses rather than BOW.\nIn general, the results indicate that the key to better vector approximation is not a richer model of composition, but rather lies in the vectors themselves. We find that our best model, the RNN, only marginally edges out the LDS. Additionally, looking at the \u201call\u201d column and the DEPs vectors, the simple additive model is only \u2264.02 lower than LDS. In comparison, we observe large differences between the vectors. The RNN+DEPs model is .23 better than the BOW5 models (.81 vs. .58), .14 better than the BOW2 models (.81 vs. .67) and .25 better than Lazaridou et al.\u2019s best model (.81 vs. .56). A wider context for BOW (5 instead of 2) yields worse results. This suggests that syntactic information or at least positional information is necessary for improved models of morpheme composition. The test vectors are annotated for relatedness, which is a proxy for semantic coherence. HR (highrelatedness) words were judged to be more compositional than LR (low-relatedness) words.\nCharacter-Level Neural Retrofitting. As a further strong baseline, we consider a retrofitting (Faruqui et al., 2015) approach based on characterlevel recurrent neural networks. Recently, running a recurrent net over the character stream has become a popular way of incorporating subword information into a model\u2014empirical gains have been observed in a diverse set of NLP tasks: POS tagging (dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014; Ling et al., 2015), parsing (Ballesteros et al., 2015) and language modeling\n(Kim et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, character-level retrofitting is a novel approach.\nGiven a vector v for a word form w, we seek a function to minimize the following objective\n1 2 ||v \u2212 hN ||22, (10)\nwhere hN is the final hidden state of a recurrent neural architecture, i.e.,\nhi = \u03c3(Ahi\u22121 +Bwi), (11)\nwhere \u03c3 is a non-linearity and wi is the ith character in w, hi\u22121 is the previous hidden state and A and B are matrices. While we have defined the architecture for a vanilla RNN, we experiment with two more advanced recurrent architectures: GRUs (Cho et al., 2014b) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) as well as deep variants (Sutskever et al., 2014; Gillick et al., 2016; Firat et al., 2016). Importantly, this model has no knowledge of morphology\u2014it can only rely on representations it extracts from the characters. This gives us a clear ablation on the benefit of adding structured morphological knowledge. We optimize the depth and the size of the hidden units on development data using a coarse-grained grid search. We found a depth of 2 and hidden units of size 100 (in both LSTM and GRU) performed best. We trained all models for 100 iterations of Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with L2 regularization with regularization coefficient 0.01.\nTable 4 shows that the two character-level models (\u201cc-GRU\u201d and \u201cc-LSTM\u201d) perform much worse than our models. This indicates that supervised morphological analysis produces higher-quality vector representations than \u201cknowledge-poor\u201d characterlevel models. However, we note that these character-level models have fewer parameters than our morpheme-level models\u2014there are many more morphemes in a languages than characters.\nOracle Morphology. In general, the twomorpheme assumption is incorrect. We consider an expanded setting of Lazaridou et al. (2013)\u2019s task, in which we fully decompose the word, e.g., unquestionably7\u2192un+question+able+ly. These results are reported in Table 3 (top block, \u201coracle\u201d). We report mean cosine similarity. Standard deviations s for 10-fold cross-validation (not shown) are\nsmall (\u2264 .012) with two exceptions: s = .044 for the DEPs-joint-stem results (.411 and .412).\nThe multi-morphemic results mirror those of the bi-morphemic setting of Lazaridou et al. (2013). (i) RNN+DEPs attains an average cosine similarity of around .80 for English. Numbers for German are lower, around .70. (ii) The RNN only marginally edges out LDS for English and is slightly worse for German. Again, this is not surprising as we are modeling short sequences. (iii) Certain embeddings lend themselves more naturally to derivational compositionality: BOW2 is better than BOW5, DEPs is the clear winner.\nInferred Morphology. The final setting we consider is the vector approximation task without gold morphology. In this case, we rely on the full joint model p(v, s, l, u | w). At evaluation, we are interested in the marginal distribution p(v | w) =\u2211\ns,l,u p(v, s, l, u | w). We then use importance sampling to approximate the mean of this marginal distribution as the predicted embedding, i.e.,\nv\u0302 = \u222b vp(v | w)dv (12)\n\u2248 1\u2211M i=1w (i)\nM\u2211\ni=1\nw(i)C\u03b2(l(i), s(i)), (13)\nwhere w(i) are the importance weights defined in Equation 8 and l(i) and s(i) are the ith sampled labeling and segmentation, respectively.\nDiscussion. Surprisingly, Table 3 (joint) shows that relying on the inferred morphology does not drastically affect the results. Indeed, we are often within .01 of the result with gold morphology. Our method can be viewed as a retrofitting procedure (Faruqui et al., 2015), so this result is useful: it indicates that joint semantic synthesis and morphological analysis produces high-quality vectors."}, {"heading": "6.3 Experiment 3: Derivational Productivity", "text": "We now delve into the relation between distributional semantics and morphological productivity. The extent to which jointly modeling semantics aids morphological analysis will be determined by the inherent compositionality of the words within the vector space. We break down our results on the vector approximation task with gold morphology using the\ndependency vectors and the RNN composer in Figure 2 by selected affixes. We observe a wide range of scores: the most compositional ending ly gives rise to cosine similarities that are 20 points higher than those of the least compositional er.\nOn the left end of Figure 2 we see extremely productive suffixes. The affix ize is used productively with relatively obscure words in the sciences, e.g., Rao-Blackwellize. Likewise, the affix ness can be applied to almost any adjective without restriction, e.g., Poissonness \u2018degree to which data have a Poisson distribution\u2019. On the right end, we find -ment, -er and re-. The affix -ment is borderline productive (Bauer, 1983)\u2014modern English tends to form novel nominalizations with ness or ity. More interesting are re- and er, both of which are very productive in English. For er, many of the words bringing down the average are simply non-compositional. For example, homer \u2018homerun in baseball\u2019 is not derived from home+er\u2014this is an error in data. We also see examples like cutter. It has a compositional reading (e.g., \u201cbox cutter\u201d), but also frequently occurs in the non-compositional meaning \u2018type of boat\u2019. Finally, proper nouns like Homer and Turner end in er and in our experiments we computed vectors for lowercased words. The affix re- similarly has a large number of non-compositional cases, e.g., remove, relocate, remark. Indeed, to get the compositional reading of remove, the first syllable (rather than the second) is typically stressed to emphasize the prefix.\nWe finally note several limitations of this experiment. (i) The ability of our models\u2014even the recurrent neural network\u2014to model transformations between vectors is limited. (ii) Our vectors are far from perfect; e.g., sparseness in the training data affects quality and some of the words in our corpus are rare. (iii) Semantic coherence is not the only criterion for productivity. An example is -th in English. As noted earlier, it is compositional in a word like warmth, but it cannot be used to form new words."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a model of the semantics and structure of derivationally complex words. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to jointly consider, within a single model, (i) the morphological decomposition of the word form and (ii) the semantic coherence of the resulting analysis. We found that directly modeling coherence increases segmentation accuracy, improving over a strong baseline. Also, our models show state-of-theart performance on the derivational vector approximation task introduced by Lazaridou et al. (2013).\nFuture work will focus on the extension of the method to more complex instances of derivational morphology, e.g., compounding and reduplication, and on the extension to additional languages. We also plan to explore the relation between derivation and distributional semantics in greater detail.\nAcknowledgments.

For example, the English word questionably can be analyzed as question+able+ly. However, this structural decomposition of the word does not directly give us a semantic representation of the word\u2019s meaning. Since morphology obeys the principle of compositionality, the semantics of the word can be systematically derived from the meaning of its parts. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the analysis of a word w into its constituent segments and the synthesis of the meaning of w from the meanings of those segments. Our model jointly learns to segment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of those morphemes. We experiment with the model on English CELEX data and German DErivBase (Zeller et al., 2013) data. We show that jointly modeling semantics increases both segmentation accuracy and morpheme F1 by between 3% and 5%. Additionally, we investigate different models of vector composition, showing that recurrent neural networks yield an improvement over simple additive models. Finally, we study the degree to which the representations correspond to a linguist\u2019s notion of morphological productivity.", "title": "Joint Semantic Synthesis and Morphological Analysis of the Derived Word"}
