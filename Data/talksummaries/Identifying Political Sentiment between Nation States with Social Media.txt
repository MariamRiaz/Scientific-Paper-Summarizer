4	28	We present intrinsic evaluations of our learners on labeled datasets as well as four extrinsic political science evaluations that show strong alignment with our large-scale sentiment extraction.
10	42	This paper hypothesizes that sentiment analysis can be used as a proxy to track international relations between nation states.
16	42	@RachOrange (California) This tweet is a positive example from the USA toward Pakistan.
20	45	We describe a multi-classifier model that aggregates tweets into counts of positive and negative sentiment from one country toward another.
22	41	We first present standard NLP sentiment experiments that show the classifiers achieve good performance on individual tweets.
25	46	We then discuss the implications for both NLP as a technical science and political science as a social science.
49	26	In fact, O’Connor et al. (2013) modeled events to detect international relations, but our goal is to model long term relation trends, not isolated events.
56	29	Jamal et al. (2015) used a supervised sentiment classifier on Arabic tweets to measure sentiment toward the USA.
59	31	To our knowledge, this paper is the largest computational approach (17 months with 2 billion tweets) to measuring international relations on social media.
60	64	The main dataset for this study is 17 months of tweets obtained through the keyword Twitter API that mention one of 187 unique countries.
106	26	The following examples illustrate this class of irrelevant tweets (nation tokens in bold): Yesterday was chilly out and now today’s going to be 80.
152	105	We construct features based on these PMI scores: (1) the highest happy PMI score of all unigrams in a tweet, (2) the highest sad PMI score, (3) the number of positive tokens, (4) the number of negative tokens, and (5) the sum of the token PMI differences between happy-sad.
153	114	General Learned Dictionary: We computed the same features as in the above learned dictionary, but instead counted tokens in all tweets of the general emoticon corpus of Go et al. (2009).
156	55	Stanford’s CoreNLP (nlp.stanford.edu/software) is used to train a MaxEnt classifier with its default settings.
157	106	The complete system to determine the nationnation sentiment of a tweet consists of 3 steps: (1) identify the country origin of the tweet, (2) filter out tweets without references to geolocated nations and filter out irrelevant topics, and (3) identify the sentiment toward the country.
160	58	Profile locations are mapped to countries with an exhaustive list of country names, major cities, and patterns that match US city/states (e.g., Pensacola,FL maps to USA).
164	62	Tweets that make it through receive 1 of 3 possible labels: positive, negative, objective.
185	38	The majority class baseline is much lower than dining at 58.7%.
202	40	Each year, GlobeScan/PIPA releases polling data of 16 nations in a ranked ordering based on how 26,000 people view their “positive contribution” to the world3.
204	38	We created our own ranking by assigning a world score to each nation n: the average sentiment ratio of all other nations toward n. Since the polling data also ranks the EU, we average the EU member nation world scores for an EU world score.
205	29	Table 4 shows the PIPA poll (Human Poll) and our world ranking (Sentiment).
224	57	We convert severity labels between nations to a pair score MID(X,Y): MID(X,Y ) = ∑ d∈Disputes(X,Y ) score(d) (2) where Disputes(X,Y) is the set of conflicts between the two nations X and Y, and score(d) is a severity score for the type of dispute d. War is -5, use of force is -4, displays of force is -3, threatening use of force is -2, and no militarized action is -1.
247	25	One core area of study is how national sentiment shifts over time, and why.
260	36	Further, our pipeline enables analysis of outside nations looking in.
261	32	For instance, the nations with the most positive view of the EU are Uruguay, Lithuania (EU member), Belarus, Moldova, and Slovakia (EU member).
270	36	Typical alliances, such as European and African clusters, are learned.
276	27	This occurs because a greater number of tweets make it through the pipeline.
281	46	These correlations more importantly suggest that we are not simply identifying a bi- nary positive or negative relation, but that the relative sentiment scores are useful.
283	66	One argument against using public opinion polls for an evaluation is that the same people who are polled by PIPA might be the same people who tend to voice opinions on Twitter.
285	68	This is not possible to know, but whether or not it is the case, this paper’s pipeline could be quite valuable in automating expensive and time consuming human polls.
