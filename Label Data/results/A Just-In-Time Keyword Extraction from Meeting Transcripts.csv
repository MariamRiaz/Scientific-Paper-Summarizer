"When translating between two languages that differ in their degree of morphological synthesis, syntactic structures in one language may be realized as morphological structures in the other.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Machine Translation models that treat words as atomic units have poor learning capabilities for such translation units, and morphological segmentations are commonly used (Koehn and Knight, 2003).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Like words in a sentence, the morphemes of a word have a hierarchical structure that is relevant in translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, compounds in Germanic languages are head-final, and the head is the segment that determines agreement within the noun phrase, and is relevant for selectional preferences of verbs.

"they charge a carry-on bag fee.

"In example 1, agreement in case, number and gender is enforced between eine ’a’ and Gebühr ’fee’, and selectional preference between erheben ’charge’ and Gebühr ’fee’.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A flat representation, as is common in phrase-based SMT, does not encode these relationships, but a dependency representation does so through dependency links.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we investigate a dependency representation of morphologically segmented words for SMT.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our representation encodes syntactic and morphological structure jointly, allowing a single model to learn the translation of both.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we work with a string-to-tree model with GHKM-style rules (Galley et al., 2006), and a relational dependency language model (Sennrich, 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We focus on the representation of German syntax and morphology in an English-to-German system, and two morphologically complex word classes in German that are challenging for translation, compounds and particle verbs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"German makes heavy use of compounding, and compounds such as Abwasserbehandlungsanlage ‘waste water treatment plant’ are translated into complex noun phrases in other languages, such as French station d’épuration des eaux résiduaires.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
German particle verbs are difficult to model because their surface realization differs depending on the finiteness of the verb and the type of clause.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Verb particles are separated from the finite verb in
2081
main clauses, but prefixed to the verb in subordinated clauses, or when the verb is non-finite.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The infinitive marker zu ’to’, which is normally a premodifying particle, appears as an infix in particle verbs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows an illustrating example.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The main focus of research on compound splitting has been on the splitting algorithm (Popovic et al., 2006; Nießen and Ney, 2000; Weller et al., 2014; Macherey et al., 2011).",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Our focus is not the splitting algorithm, but the representation of compounds.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"For splitting, we use an approach similar to (Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010), with segmentation candidates identified by a finite-state morphology (Schmid et al., 2004; Sennrich and Kunz, 2014), and statistical evidence from the training corpus to select a split (Koehn and Knight, 2003).
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"German compounds are head-final, and premodifiers can be added recursively.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
Compounds are structurally ambiguous if there is more than one modifier.,2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
Consider the distinction between (Stadtteil)projekt (literally: ’(city part) project)’) and Stadt(teilprojekt) ’city sub-project’.,2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"We opt for a left-branching representation by default.1 We also split linking elements, and represent them as a postmodifier of each non-final segment, including the empty string ("" "").",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"We use the same representation for noun compounds and adjective compounds.
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
An example of the original2 and the proposed compound representation is shown in Figure 1.,2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Importantly, the head of the compound is also the parent of the determiners and attributes in the noun phrase, which makes a bigram dependency language model sufficient to enforce agreement.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Since we model morphosyntactic agreement within the main translation step, and not in a separate step as in (Fraser et al., 2012), we deem it useful that inflection is marked at the head of the compound.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Consequently, we do not split off inflectional or derivational morphemes.
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"For German particle verbs, we define a common representation that abstracts away from the various surface realizations (see Table 1).",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Separated
1We follow prior work in leaving frequent words or subwords unsplit, which has a disambiguating effect.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"With more aggressive splitting, frequency information could be used for the structural disambiguation of internal structure.
",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"2The original dependency trees follow the annotation guidelines by Foth (2005).
verb particles are reordered to be the closest premodifier of the verb.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Prefixed particles and the zuinfix are identified by the finite-state-morphology, and split from the verb so that the particle is the closest, the zu marker the next-closest premodifier of the verb, as shown in Figure 2.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"Agreement, selectional preferences, and other phenomena involve the verb and its dependents, and the proposed representation retains these dependency links, but reduces data sparsity from affixation and avoids discontinuity of the verb and its particle.",2 A Dependency Representation of Compounds and Particle Verbs,[0],[0]
"We follow Williams et al. (2014) and map dependency trees into a constituency representation, which allows for the extraction of GHKM-style translation rules (Galley et al., 2006).",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"This conversion is lossless, and we can still apply a de-
pendency language model (RDLM).",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Figure 3 (a) shows the constituency representation of the example in Figure 1.
",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Our model should not only be able to produce new words productively, but also to memorize words it has observed during training.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Looking at the compound Handgepäckgebühr in Figure 3 (a), we can see that it does not form a constituent, and cannot be extracted with GHKM extraction heuristics.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"To address this, we binarize the trees in our training data (Wang et al., 2007).
",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
A complicating factor is that the binarization should not impair the RDLM.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"During decoding, we map the internal tree structure of each hypothesis back to the unbinarized form, which is then scored by the RDLM.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
Virtual nodes introduced by the binarization must also be scorable by RDLM if they form the root of a translation hypothesis.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
A simple right or left binarization would produce virtual nodes without head and without meaningful dependency representation.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
We ensure that each virtual node dominates the head of the full constituent through a mixed binarization.3,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we perform right binarization of the head and all pre-modifiers, then left binarization of all post-modifiers.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"This head-binarized representation is illustrated in Figure 3 (b).4
Head binarization ensures that even hypotheses whose root is a virtual node can be scored by the RDLM.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"This score is only relevant for pruning, and discarded when the full constituent is scored.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Still, these hypotheses require special treatment in the RDLM to mitigate search errors.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"The virtual node labels (such as OBJA) are unknown symbols to the RDLM, and we simply replace them with the original label (OBJA).",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"The RDLM uses sibling context, and this is normally padded with special start and stop symbols, analogous to BOS/EOS symbols in n-gram models.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
These start and stop symbols let the RDLM compute the probability that a node is the first or last child of its ancestor node.,3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"However, computing these probabilities for virtual nodes would unfairly bias the search, since the first/last child of a virtual node is not necessarily the first/last child of the full constituent.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"We adapt the representation of virtual nodes in
3In other words, every node is a fixed well-formed dependency structure (Shen et al., 2010) with our binarization.
",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"4Note that our definition of head binarization is different from that of Wang et al. (2007), who left-binarize a node if the head is the first child, and right-binarize otherwise.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"Our algorithm also covers cases where the head has both pre- and post-modifiers, as erheben and gepäck do in Figure 3.
RDLM to take this into account.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"We distinguish between virtual nodes based on whether their span is a string prefix, suffix, or infix of the full constituent.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"For prefixes and infixes, we do not add a stop symbol at the end, and use null symbols, which denote unavailable context, for padding to the right.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"For suffixes and infixes, we do the same at the start.",3 Tree Binarization,[0],[0]
"For SMT, all German training and development data is converted into the representation described in sections 2–3.",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"To restore the original representation, we start from the tree output of the stringto-tree decoder.",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"Merging compounds is trivial: all segments and linking elements can be identified by the tree structure, and are concatenated.
",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"For verbs that dominate a verb particle, the original order is restored through three rules:
1. non-finite verbs are concatenated with the particle, and zu-markers are infixed.
2. finite verbs that head a subordinated clause (identified by its dependency label) are concatenated with the particle.

particle moved to the right clause",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]

Previous work on particle verb translation into German proposed to predict the position of particles with an n-gram language model (Nießen and Ney, 2001).",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"Our rules have the advantage that they are informed by the syntax of the sentence and consider the finiteness of the verb.
",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
Our rules only produce projective trees.,4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
"Verb particles may also appear in positions that violate projectivity, and we leave it to future research to determine if our limitation to projective trees affects translation quality, and how to produce nonprojective trees.",4 Post-Processing,[0],[0]
We train English–German string-to-tree SMT systems on the training data of the shared translation task of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT) 2015.,5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
"The data set consists of 4.2 million sentence pairs of parallel data, and 160 million sentences of monolingual German data.

We base our systems on that of Williams et al. (2014).,5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
"It is a string-to-tree GHKM translation system implemented in Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and using the dependency annotation by ParZu (Sennrich et al., 2013).",5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
"Additionally, our baseline system contains a dependency language model (RDLM) (Sennrich, 2015), trained on the target-side of the parallel training data.

"We report case-sensitive BLEU scores on the newstest2014/5 test sets from WMT, averaged over 3 optimization runs of k-batch MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012) on a subset of newstest2008-12.6
We split all particle verbs and hyphenated compounds, but other compounds are only split if they are rare (frequency in parallel text < 5).
",5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
"For comparison with the state-of-the-art, we train a full system on our restructured representation, which incorporates all models and settings of our WMT 2015 submission system (Williams et al., 2015).7 Note that our WMT 2015 submission

"6We use mteval-v13a.pl for comparability to official WMT results; all significance values reported are obtained with MultEval (Clark et al., 2011).
",5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
"7In contrast to our other systems in this paper, RDLM is trained on all monolingual data for the full system, and two models are added: a 5-gram Neural Network language model
uses the dependency representation of compounds and tree binarization introduced in this paper; we achieve additional gains over the submission system through particle verb restructuring.",5.1 Data and Models,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows translation quality (BLEU) with different representations of German compounds and particle verbs.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"Head binarization not only yields improvements over the baseline, but also allows for larger gains from morphological segmentation.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"We attribute this to the fact that full compounds, and prefixed particle verbs, are not always a constituent in the segmented representation, and that binarization compensates this theoretical drawback.
",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"With head binarization, we find substantial improvements from compound splitting of 0.7–1.1 BLEU.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"On newstest2014, the improvement is almost twice of that reported in related work (Williams et al., 2014), which also uses a hierarchical representation of compounds, albeit one that does not allow for dependency modelling.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"Examples of correct, unseen compounds generated include Staubsauger|roboter ’vacuum cleaner robot’, Gravitation|s|wellen ’gravitational waves’, and NPD|-|verbot|s|verfahren ’NPD banning process’.8

Particle verb restructuring yields additional gains of 0.1–0.4 BLEU.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"One reason for the smaller effect of particle verb restructuring is that the difficult cases – separated particle verbs and those with infixation – are rarer than compounds, with 2841 rare compounds [that would be split by our compound splitter] in the reference texts, in contrast to 553 separated particle verbs, and 176 particle verbs with infixation, as Table 3 illustrates.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"If we only evaluate the sentences containing a particle verb with zu-infix in the reference, 165 in total for newstest2014/5, we observe an improvement of 0.8 BLEU on this subset (22.1→22.9), significant with p < 0.05.
",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
The positive effect of restructuring is also apparent in frequency statistics.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows that the baseline system severely undergenerates compounds and separated/infixed particle verbs.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"Binarization, compound splitting, and particle verb restructuring all contribute to bringing the distribution of compounds and particle verbs closer to the reference.
",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"In total, the restructured representation yields improvements of 1.4–1.8 BLEU over our baseline.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
The full system is competitive with official submissions to the WMT 2015 shared translation tasks.,5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"It outperforms our submission (Williams et al., 2015) by 0.4 BLEU, and outperforms other phrase-based and syntax-based submissions by 0.8 BLEU or more.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"The best reported result according to BLEU is an ensemble of Neural MT systems (Jean et al., 2015), which achieves 24.9 BLEU.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
"In the human evaluation, both our submission and the Neural MT system were ranked 1–2 (out of 16), with no significant difference between them.",5.2 SMT Results,[0],[0]
We perform a synthetic experiment to test our claim that a dependency representation allows for the modelling of agreement between morphemes.,5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"For 200 rare compounds [that would be split by our compound splitter] in the newstest2014/5 references, we artificially introduce agreement errors by changing the gender of the determiner.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"For instance, we create the erroneous sentence sie erheben ein Handgepäckgebühr as a complement to Example 1.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
We measure the ability of language models to prefer (give a higher probability to) the original reference sentence over the erroneous one.,5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"In the original representation, both a Kneser-

"Ney 5-gram LM and RDLM perform poorly due to data sparseness, with 70% and 57.5% accuracy, respectively.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"In the split representation, the RDLM reliably prefers the correct agreement (96.5% accuracy), whilst the performance of the 5-gram model even deteriorates (to 60% accuracy).",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"This is because the gender of the first segment(s) is irrelevant, or even misleading, for agreement.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
"For instance, Handgepäck is neuter, which could lead a morpheme-level n-gram model to prefer the determiner ein, but Handgepäckgebühr is feminine and requires eine.",5.3 Synthetic LM Experiment,[0],[0]
Our main contribution is that we exploit the hierarchical structure of morphemes to model them jointly with syntax in a dependency-based stringto-tree SMT model.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We describe the dependency annotation of two morphologically complex word classes in German, compounds and particle verbs, and show that our tree representation yields improvements in translation quality of 1.4–1.8 BLEU in the WMT English–German translation task.9
The principle of jointly representing syntactic and morphological structure in dependency trees can be applied to other language pairs, and we expect this to be helpful for languages with a high degree of morphological synthesis.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"However, the annotation needs to be adapted to the respective languages.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"For example, French compounds such as arc-en-ciel ’rainbow’ are head-initial, in contrast to head-final Germanic compounds.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"The daily life of Chinese people heavily depends on Chinese input method engine (IME), no matter whether one is composing an E-mail, writing an article, or sending a text message.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"However, every Chinese word inputted into computer or cellphone cannot be typed through one-to-one mapping of key-to-letter inputting directly, but has to go through an IME as there are thousands of Chinese characters for inputting while only 26 letter keys are available in the keyboard.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
An IME is an essential software interface that maps Chinese characters into English letter combinations.,1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]

ficient IME will largely improve the user experience of Chinese information processing.
",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
Nowadays most of Chinese IMEs are pinyin based.,1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Pinyin is originally designed as the phonetic symbol of a Chinese character (based on the standard modern Chinese, mandarin) , using Latin letters as its syllable notation.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"For example, the pinyin of the Chinese character “爱”(love) is “ài”.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Most characters usually have unique pinyin representations, while a few Chinese characters may be pronounced in several different ways, so they may have multiple pinyin representations.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
The advantage of pinyin IME is that it only adopts the pronunciation perspective of Chinese characters so that it is simple and easy to learn.,1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"But there are only less than 500 pinyin syllables in standard modern Chinese, compared with over 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters, which leads to serious ambiguities for pinyin-to-charactermapping.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Modern pinyin IMEsmostly use a “sentencebased” decoding technique (Chen and Lee, 2000) to alleviate the ambiguities.",1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
“Sentence based” means that IME generates a sequence of Chinese characters upon a sequence of pinyin inputs with respect to certain statistical criteria.,1.1 Chinese Input Method,[0],[0]
"Written in Chinese characters but not alphabets, spell checking for Chinese language is quite different from the same task for other languages.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"Since Chinese characters are entered via IME, those user-made typos do not immediately lead to spelling errors.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"When a user types a wrong letter, IME will be very likely to fail to generate the expected Chinese character sequence.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"Normally, the user may immediately notice the inputting error and then make corrections, which usually means doing a bunch of extra operations like cursor
1512
movement, deletion and re-typing.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"Thus there are two separated sub-tasks for Chinese spell checking: 1. typo checking for user typed pinyin sequences which should be a built-in module in IME, and 2. spell checking for Chinese texts in its narrow sense, which is typically a module of word processing applications (Yang et al., 2012b).",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"These two terms are often confused especially in IME related works such as (Chen and Lee, 2000) and (Wu et al., 2009).
",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
Pinyin typos have always been a serious problem for Chinese pinyin IMEs.,1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
The user may fail to input the completely right pinyin simply because he/she is a dialect speaker and does not know the exact pronunciation for the expected character.,1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"This may be a very common situation since there are about seven quite different dialects in Chinese, among which being spoken languages, six are far different from the standard modern Chinese, mandarin.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"With the boom of smart-phones, pinyin typos worsen due to the limited size of soft keyboard, and the lack of physical feedback on the touch screen.",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"However, existing practical IMEs only provide small patches to deal with typos such as Fuzzy Pinyin (Wu and Chen, 2004) and other language specific errors (Zheng et al., 2011b).
",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
Typo checking and correction has an important impact on IME performance.,1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"When IME fails to correct a typo and generate the expected sentence, the user will have to takemuch extra effort to move the cursor back to the mistyped letter and correct it, which leads to very poor user experience (Jia and Zhao, 2013).",1.2 Typos and Chinese Spell Checking,[0],[0]
"The very first approach for Chinese input with typo correction was made by (Chen and Lee, 2000), which was also the initial attempt of “sentence-based” IME.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"The idea of “statistical input method” was proposed by modeling PTC conversion as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and using Viterbi (Viterbi, 1967) algorithm to decode the sequence.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
They solved the typo correction problem by decomposing the conditional probability P (H|P ) of Chinese character sequence H given pinyin sequence P into a language model P (wi|wi−1) and a typing model P (pi|wi).,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
The typing model that was estimated on real user input data was for typo correction.,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"However, real user input data can be very noisy and not very convenient to obtain.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"As we will propose a joint model
in this paper, such an individual typing model is not necessarily built in our approach.
",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"(Zheng et al., 2011a) developed an IME system with typo correction called CHIME using noisy channel error model and language-specific features.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
However their model depended on a very strong assumption that input pinyin sequence should have been segmented into pinyin words by the user.,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
This assumption does not really hold in modern “sentence-based” IMEs.,2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"We release this assumption since our model solves segmentation, typo correction and PTC conversion jointly.
",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"Besides the common HMM approach for PTC conversion, there are also variousmethods such as: support vector machine (Jiang et al., 2007), maximum entropy (ME) model (Wang et al., 2006), conditional random field (CRF) (Li et al., 2009) and statistical machine translation (SMT) (Yang et al., 2012a; Wang et al., 2013c; Zhang and Zhao, 2013), etc.
",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"Spell checking or typo checking was first proposed for English (Peterson, 1980).",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"(Mays et al., 1991) addressed that spell checking should be done within a context, i.e., a sentence or a long phrase with a certain meaning, instead of only in one word.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"A recent spell correction work is (Li et al., 2006), where a distributional similarity was introduced for spell correction of web queries.
",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"Early attempts for Chinese spelling checking could date back to (Chang, 1994) where character tables for similar shape, pronunciation, meaning, and input-method-code characters were proposed.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"More recently, the 7th SIGHANWorkshop on Chinese Language Processing (Yu et al., 2013) held a shared task on Chinese spell checking.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
"Various approaches were made for the task including language model (LM) based methods (Chen et al., 2013), ME model (Han and Chang, 2013), CRF (Wang et al., 2013d; Wang et al., 2013a), SMT (Chiu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013), and graph model (Jia et al., 2013), etc.",2 Related Works,[0],[0]
It is a rather long journey from the first English letter typed on the keyboard to finally a completed Chinese sentence generated by IME.,3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
"We will first take an overview of the entire process.
",3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
The average length of pinyin syllables is about 3 letters.,3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
There are about 410 pinyin syllables used in the current pinyin system.,3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
"Each pinyin sylla-
ble has a bunch of corresponding Chinese characters which share the same pronunciation represented by the syllable.",3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
The number of those homophones ranges from 1 to over 300.,3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
Chinese characters then form words.,3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
But word in Chinese is a rather vague concept.,3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]
"Without word delimiters, linguists have argued on what a Chinese word really is for a long time and that is why there is always a primary word segmentation treatment in most Chinese language processing tasks (Zhao et al., 2006; Huang and Zhao, 2007; Zhao and Kit, 2008; Zhao et al., 2010; Zhao and Kit, 2011; Zhao et al., 2013).",3.1 From English Letter to Chinese Sentence,[0],[0]

"For example, if one wants to input “你好世界 (Hello world)”, he will just type “nihaoshijie” instead of segmented pinyin sequence “ni hao shi jie”.",3.2 Pinyin Segmentation and Typo Correction,[0],[0]
"Nevertheless, pinyin syllable segmentation is a much easier problem compared to Chinese word segmentation.",3.2 Pinyin Segmentation and Typo Correction,[0],[0]

"Inspired by (Yang et al., 2012b) and (Jia et al., 2013), we adopt the graph model for Chinese spell checking for pinyin segmentation and typo correction, which is based on the shortest path word segmentation algorithm (Casey and Lecolinet, 1996).",3.2 Pinyin Segmentation and Typo Correction,[0],[0]

In a meeting, it is often desirable to extract keywords from each utterance as soon as it is spoken. Thus, this paper proposes a just-intime keyword extraction from meeting transcripts. The proposed method considers two major factors that make it different from keyword extraction from normal texts. The first factor is the temporal history of preceding utterances that grants higher importance to recent utterances than old ones, and the second is topic relevance that forces only the preceding utterances relevant to the current utterance to be considered in keyword extraction. Our experiments on two data sets in English and Korean show that the consideration of the factors results in performance improvement in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",text,[0],[0]
A meeting is generally accomplished by a number of participants and a wide range of subjects are discussed.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, it would be helpful to meeting participants to provide them with some additional information related to the current subject.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, assume that a participant is discussing a specific topic with other participants at a meeting.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The summary of previous meetings on the topic is then one of the most important resources for her discussion.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In order to provide information on a topic to participants, keywords should be first generated for the topic since keywords are often representatives of a topic.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A number of techniques have been proposed
for automatic keyword extraction (Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2000; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Wan et al., 2007), and they are designed to extract keywords from a written document.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, they are not suitable for meeting transcripts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In a meeting, it is often desirable to extract keywords at the time at which a new utterance is made for just-in-time service of additional information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Otherwise, the extracted keywords become just the important words at the end of the meeting.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Two key factors for just-in-time keyword extraction from meeting transcripts are time of preceding utterances and topic of current utterance.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, current utterance is affected by temporal history of preceding utterances.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"That is, when a new utterance is made it is likely to be related more closely with latest utterances than old ones.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, the preceding utterances which carry similar topics to current utterance are more important than irrelevant utterances.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since a meeting consists of several topics, the utterances that have nothing to do with current utterance are inappropriate as a history of the current utterance.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This paper proposes a graph-based keyword extraction to reflect these factors.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The proposed method represents an utterance as a graph of which nodes are candidate keywords.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The preceding utterances are also expressed as a history graph in which the weight of an edge is the temporal importance of the keywords connected by the edge.,1 Introduction,[1.0],['The preceding utterances are also expressed as a history graph in which the weight of an edge is the temporal importance of the keywords connected by the edge.']
"To reflect the temporal history of utterances, forgetting curve (Wozniak, 1999) is adopted in updating the weights of edges in the history graph.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['To reflect the temporal history of utterances, forgetting curve (Wozniak, 1999) is adopted in updating the weights of edges in the history graph.']"
"It expresses effectively not only the reciprocal relation between memory re-

tention and time, but also active recall that makes frequent words more consequential in keyword extraction.",1 Introduction,[0.9999999739437557],"['It expresses effectively not only the reciprocal relation between memory re- 888 tention and time, but also active recall that makes frequent words more consequential in keyword extraction.']"
"Then, a subgraph that is relevant to the current utterance is derived from the history graph, and used as an actual history of the current utterance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The keywords of the current utterance are extracted by TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) from the merged graph of the current utterance and the history graphs.

"The proposed method is evaluated with two kinds of data sets: the National Assembly transcripts in Korean and the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003) in English.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['The proposed method is evaluated with two kinds of data sets: the National Assembly transcripts in Korean and the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003) in English.']"
"The experimental results show that it outperforms both the TFIDF framework (Frank et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2009) and the PageRank-based graph model (Wan et al., 2007).",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['The experimental results show that it outperforms both the TFIDF framework (Frank et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2009) and the PageRank-based graph model (Wan et al., 2007).']"
One thing to note is that the proposed method improves even the supervised methods that do not reflect utterance time and topic relevance for the ICSI corpus.,1 Introduction,[1.0],['One thing to note is that the proposed method improves even the supervised methods that do not reflect utterance time and topic relevance for the ICSI corpus.']
"This proves that it is critical to consider time and content of utterances simultaneously in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.

"Keyword extraction has been of interest for a long time in various fields such as information retrieval, document clustering, summarization, and so on.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Thus, there have been many studies on automatic keyword extraction.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The frequency-based keyword extraction with TFIDF weighting (Frank et al., 1999) and the graph-based keyword extraction (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) are two base models for this task.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Many studies recently tried to extend them by incorporating specific information such as linguistic knowledge (Hulth, 2003), web-based resource (Turney, 2003), and semantic knowledge (Chen et al., 2010).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As a result, they show good performance on written text.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, it is difficult to use them directly for spoken genres, since spoken genres have significantly different characteristics from written
text.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
There have been a few studies focused on keyword extraction from spoken genres.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Among them, the extraction from meetings has attracted more concern, since the need for grasping important points of a meeting or an opinion of each participant has increased.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The studies on meetings focused on the exterior features of meeting dialogues such as unstructured and ill-formed sentences.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Liu et al. (2009) used some knowledge sources such as Partof-Speech (POS) filtering, word clustering, and sentence salience to reflect dialogue features, and they found out that a simple TFIDF-based keyword extraction using these knowledge sources works reasonably well.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"They also extended their work by adopting various features such as decision making sentence features, speech-related features, and summary features that reflect meeting transcripts better (Liu et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Chen et al. (2010) extracted keywords from spoken course lectures.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this study, they considered prosodic information from HKT forced alignment and topics in a lecture generated by Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These studies focused on the exterior characteristics of spoken genres, since they assumed that entire scripts are given in advance and then they extracted keywords that best describe the scripts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study considered time of utterances which is an intrinsic element of spoken genres.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The relevance between current utterance and preceding utterances is also a critical feature in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The study that considers this relevance explicitly is CollabRank proposed by Wan and Xiao (2008).,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
This is collaborative approach to extract keywords in a document.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this study, it is assumed that a few neighbor documents close to a current document can help extract keywords.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Therefore, they applied a clustering algorithm to a document set and then extracted words that are reinforced by the documents within a cluster.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, this method also does not consider the utterance time, since it is designed to extract keywords from normal documents.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As a result, if it is applied to meeting transcripts, all preceding utterances would affect the current utterance uniformly, which leads to a poor performance.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Figure 1 depicts the overall process of extracting keywords from an utterance as soon as it is spoken.,3 Just-In-Time Keyword Extraction for a Meeting,[0],[0]

The summary of all preceding utterances is also represented as a history graph (G2).,3 Just-In-Time Keyword Extraction for a Meeting,[1.0],['The summary of all preceding utterances is also represented as a history graph (G2).']
We assume that only the preceding utterances that are directly related with the current utterance are important for extracting keywords from the current utterance.,3 Just-In-Time Keyword Extraction for a Meeting,[0],[0]

This is because the current utterance becomes a part of the history graph for the next utterance.,4.1 Current Utterance Graph and History Graph,[0],[0]
"As a history, old utterances are less important than recent ones.",4.1 Current Utterance Graph and History Graph,[0],[0]

"When a keyword extraction system generates keywords which many annotators agree, a higher score is given to it.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, a lower score is given if fewer annotators agree.
",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
The proposed method is compared with two baseline models to see its relative performance.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"One is the frequency-based keyword extraction with TFIDF weighting (Frank et al., 1999) and the other is TextRank in which the weight of edges is mutual information between vertices (Wan et al., 2007).",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"In TFIDF, each utterance is considered as a document, and thus all utterances including the current one are regarded as whole documents.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
The frequencybased TFIDF chooses top-K words according to their TFIDF value from the set of words appearing in the meeting transcript.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"Since the human annotators are restricted to extract up to five keywords, the keyword extraction systems including our method are also requested to select top-5 keywords when more than five keywords are produced.
",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"In order to see the effect of preceding utterances in baseline models, the performances are measured according to the number of preceding utterances used.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows the results.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
The X-axis of this figure is the number of preceding utterances and the Yaxis represents F-measures.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"As shown in this figure, the performance of the baseline models improves monotonically at first as the number of preceding utterances increases.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"However, the performance improvement stops when many preceding utterances are involved, and the performance begins to drop
when too many utterances are considered.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"The performance of TextRank model drops from 20 preceding utterances, while that of TFIDF model begins to drops at 50 utterances.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"When too many preceding utterances are taken into account, it is highly possible that some of their topics are irrelevant to the current utterance, which leads to performance drop.
",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
Table 2 compares our method with the baseline models on the National Assembly transcripts.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
The performances of baseline models are obtained when they show the best performance for various number of preceding utterances.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"TextRank model achieves F-measure of 0.478 and weighted relative score of 0.387, while TFIDF reports its best F-measure of 0.481 and weighted relative score of 0.394.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"Thus, the difference between TFIDF and TextRank is not significant.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"However, F-measure and weighted relative score of the proposed method are 0.533 and 0.421 respectively, and they are much higher than those of baseline models.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"In addition, our method achieves precision of 0.543 and recall of 0.523 and
this is much higher performance than TextRank whose precision is just 0.510.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"Since the proposed method uses, as history, the preceding utterances relevant to the current utterance, its performance is kept high even if whole utterances are used.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"Therefore, it could be inferred that it is important to adopt only the relevant history in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.
",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
One of the key factors of our method is the temporal history.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
Its importance is given in Table 3.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"As explained above, the temporal history is achieved by Equation (2).",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"Thus, the proposed model does not reflect the temporal importance of preceding utterances if w2ij = 1 always.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"That is, under w 2 ij = 1, old utterances are regarded as important as recent utterances.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"Without temporal history, F-measure and weighted relative score are just 0.518 and 0.413 respectively.",5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
These poor performances prove the importance of the temporal history in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.,5.1 National Assembly Transcripts in Korean,[0],[0]
"The proposed method is also evaluated on the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003) which consists of naturally occurring meetings recordings.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
This corpus is widely used for summarizing and extracting keywords of meetings.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
We followed all the experimental settings proposed by Liu et al. (2009) for this corpus.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Among 26 meeting transcripts chosen by Liu et al. from 161 transcripts of the ICSI meeting corpus, 6 transcripts are used as development data and the remaining transcripts are used as data to extract keywords.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"The parameters for the ICSI meeting corpus are set to be d = 0.85,W = 10, and θ = 0.20.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Each meeting of the corpus consists of several topic segments, and every topic segment contains three sets of keywords that are annotated by three annotators.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Up to five keywords are annotated for a topic segment.
",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
Table 4 shows simple statistics of the ICSI meeting data.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Total number of topic segments in the 26 meetings is originally 201, but some of them do not
have keywords.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Such segments are discarded, and the remaining 140 topic segments are actually used.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"The average number of utterances in a topic segment is 260 and the average number of words per utterance is 7.22.
",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Unlike the National Assembly transcripts, the keywords of the ICSI meeting corpus are annotated at the topic segment level, not the utterance level.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the proposed method which extracts keywords at the utterance level can not be applied directly to this corpus.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"In order to obtain keywords for a topic segment with the proposed method, the keywords are first extracted from each utterance in the segment by the proposed method and then they are all accumulated.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
The proposed method extracts keywords for a topic segment from these accumulated utterance-level keywords as follows.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
Assume that a topic segment consists of l utterances.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Since our method can extract up to 5 keywords for each utterance, the number of keywords for the segment can reach to 5 · l. From these keywords, we select top-5 keywords ranked by Equation (3).
",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
The proposed method is compared with three previous studies.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
The first two are the methods proposed by Liu et al. (2009),5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"One is the frequencybased method of TFIDF weighting with the features such as POS filtering, word clustering, and sentence salience score, and the other is the graph-based method with POS filtering.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"The last method is a maximum entropy model applied to this task (Liu et al., 2008).",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Note that the maximum entropy is a supervised learning model.
",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
Table 5 summarizes the comparison results.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"As shown in this table, the proposed method outperforms all previous methods.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Our method achieves precision of 0.311 and recall of 0.361, and thus the F-score is 0.334.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
The weight relative score of the proposed method is 0.533.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
This is the improvement of up to 0.044 in F-measure and 0.129 in weighted relative score over other unsupervised methods (TFIDF-Liu and TextRank-Liu).,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
It should be also noted that the proposed method outperforms even the supervised method (ME model).,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"The difference between our method and the maximum entropy model in weighted relative score is 0.132.
",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
One possible variant of the proposed method for the ICSI corpus is to simply merge the current utterance graph (G1) with the history graph (G2) rather than to extract keywords from each utterance.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"After the current utterance graph of the last utterance in a topic segment is merged into the history graph, the keywords for the segment are extracted from the history graph.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"This variant and the proposed method both rely on the temporal history, but the difference is that the history graph of the variant accumulates all information within the topic segment.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Thus, the keywords extracted from the history graph by this variant are those without consideration of topic relevance.
",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
Table 6 compares the proposed method with the variant.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
The performance of the variant is higher than those of TFIDF-Liu and TextRank-Liu.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
This proves the importance of the temporal history in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.,5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"However, the proposed method still outperforms the variant, and it demonstrates the importance of topic relevance.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"Therefore, it can be concluded that the consideration of temporal history and topic relevance is critical in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",5.2 ICSI Meeting Corpus in English,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we have proposed a just-in-time keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Whenever an utterance is spoken, the proposed method extracts keywords from the utterance that best describe the utterance.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Based on the graph representation of all components in a meeting, the proposed method extracts keywords by TextRank with some graph operations.
",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Temporal history and topic of the current utterance are two major factors especially in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
This is because recent utterances are more important than old ones and only the preceding utterances of which topic is relevant to the current utterance are important.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"To model the temporal importance of the preceding utterances, the concept of forgetting curve is used in updating the history graph of preceding utterances.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In addition, the subgraph of the history graph that shares words appearing in the current utterance graph is used to extract keywords rather than whole history graph.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
The proposed method was evaluated with the National Assembly transcripts and the ICSI meeting corpus.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"According to our experimental results on these data sets, the performance of keyword extraction is improved when we consider temporal history and topic relevance.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"In a meeting, it is often desirable to extract keywords from each utterance as soon as it is spoken.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"Thus, this paper proposes a just-intime keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.",abstractText,[0],[0]
The proposed method considers two major factors that make it different from keyword extraction from normal texts.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"The first factor is the temporal history of preceding utterances that grants higher importance to recent utterances than old ones, and the second is topic relevance that forces only the preceding utterances relevant to the current utterance to be considered in keyword extraction.",abstractText,[0],[0]
Our experiments on two data sets in English and Korean show that the consideration of the factors results in performance improvement in keyword extraction from meeting transcripts.,abstractText,[0],[0]
