26	7	• We develop a novel conditioning scheme that helps the training by varying appearance and motion conditions.
27	44	• We use perceptual triplet ranking to encourage videos of similar conditions to look similar.
61	23	We formulate this as learning the conditional distribution p(x|y) where x is a video and y = [ya,ym] is a set of conditions known to occur.
62	8	We define two conditioning variables, ya and ym, that encode appearance and motion information, respectively.
63	17	We propose an Appearance-Motion Conditional GAN, shown in Figure 1.
65	7	We denote a generated video by x̂|y = G(z|y), where z is random noise.
69	1	The generator and the two discriminators form a conditional GAN (Mirza & Osindero, 2014).
71	15	If we follow the traditional training method (Mirza & Osindero, 2014), the model may treat them as random noise.
72	14	To ensure that the conditioning variables have intended influence on the data generation process, we employ a ranking network R, which takes as input a triplet (x|y, x̂|y, x̂|y′) and forces x|y and x̂|y to look more similar to each other than x|y and x̂|y′ , because in the latter pair, the conditions do not match (y 6= y′).
73	31	In addition to the ranking constraint, we propose a novel conditioning scheme to put constraints on the learning objective with respect to the conditioning variables.
74	159	We explain our learning strategy and the conditioning scheme in Section 3.3, and discuss model training in Section 3.4.
75	128	The appearance condition ya can be any high-level abstraction that encodes visual appearance; we use a single RGB image ya ∈ R64×64×3 (e.g., the first frame of a video).
76	40	The motion condition ym can also be any high-level abstraction that encodes motion.
77	123	We define it as ym = [ ylm,y v m ] , where ylm ∈ Rc is a motion category label encoded as a one-hot vector, and yvm ∈ R(T−1)×2k is the velocity of k keypoints in 2D space detected from an image sequence of length T .
78	29	We explain how we extract keypoints in Section 4.
79	12	We repeat ylm T−1 times to obtain ym ∈ R(T−1)×q , where q = (c+ 2k).
