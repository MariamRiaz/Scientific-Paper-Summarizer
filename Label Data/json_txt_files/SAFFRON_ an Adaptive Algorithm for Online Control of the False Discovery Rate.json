Introduction", "text": "It is now commonplace in science and technology to make thousands or even millions of related decisions based on data analysis. As a simplified example, to discover which genes may be related to diabetes, we can formulate the decision-making problem in terms of hypotheses that take the form \u201cgene X is not associated with diabetes,\u201d for many different genes X, and test for which of these null hypotheses can be confidently rejected by the data. As first identified by Tukey in a seminal 1953 manuscript (1953), the central difficulty when testing a large number of null hypotheses is that several of them may appear to be false, purely by chance. Arguably, we would like the set of rejected null hypothesesR to have high precision, so that most discovered genes are indeed truly correlated with diabetes and further investigations are not fruitless. Unfortunately, separately controlling the false positive rate for each individual test actually does not provide any guarantee on the precision. This motivated the development of procedures that can provide guarantees on an error metric called the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995), defined as:\nFDR \u2261 E [FDP(R)] = E [ |H0 \u2229R| |R| ] ,\nwhereH0 is the unknown set of truly null hypotheses, and 0/0 \u2261 0. Here the FDP represents the ratio of falsely rejected nulls to the total number of rejected nulls, and since the set of discoveries R is data-dependent, the FDR takes an expectation over the underlying randomness. The evidence from a hypothesis test can typically be summarized in terms of a p-value, and so offline multiple testing algorithms take a set of p-values {Pi} as their input, and a target FDR level \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), and produce a rejected set R that is guaranteed to have FDR \u2264 \u03b1. Of course, one also desires a high recall, or equivalently a low false negative rate, but without assumptions on many uncontrollable factors like the frequency and strength of signals, additional guarantees on the recall are impossible.\nWhile the offline paradigm previously described is the classical setting for multiple decision-making, the corresponding online problem is emerging as a major area of its own. For example, large information technology companies run thou-\nsands of A/B tests every week of the year, and decisions about whether or not to reject the corresponding null hypothesis must be made without knowing the outcomes of future tests; indeed, future null hypotheses may depend on the outcome of the current test. The current standard of setting all thresholds \u03b1k to a fixed quantity such as 0.05 does not provide any control of the FDR. Hence, the following hypothetical scenario is entirely plausible: a company conducts 1000 tests in one week, each with a target false positive rate of 0.05; it happens to make 80 discoveries in total of which 50 are accidental false discoveries, ending up with an FDP of 5/8. Such uncontrolled error rates can have severe financial and social consequences.\nThe first method for online control of the FDR was the alpha-investing algorithm of Foster and Stine (2008), later extended to generalized alpha-investing (GAI) algorithms by Aharoni and Rosset (2014). Recently, Javanmard and Montanari (2017) proposed variants of GAI algorithms that control the FDR (as opposed to the modified FDR controlled in the original paper (Foster & Stine, 2008)), including a new algorithm called LORD. The GAI++ algorithms by Ramdas et al. (2017) improved the earlier GAI algorithms (uniformly), and the improved LORD++ (henceforth LORD) method arguably represents the current state-of-the-art in online multiple hypothesis testing.\nThe current paper\u2019s central contribution is the derivation and analysis of a powerful new class of online FDR algorithms called \u201cSAFFRON\u201d (Serial estimate of the Alpha Fraction that is Futilely Rationed On true Null hypotheses). As an instance of the GAI framework, the SAFFRON method starts off with an error budget, referred to as alphawealth, that it allocates to different tests over time, earning back some alpha-wealth whenever it makes a new discovery. However, unlike earlier work in the online setting, SAFFRON is an adaptive method, meaning that it is based on an estimate of the proportion of true nulls. In the offline setting, adaptive methods were proposed by Storey (2002; 2004), who showed that they are more powerful than the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995) under independence assumptions; this advantage usually increases with the proportion of non-nulls and the signal strength. Thus, the SAFFRON method can be viewed as an online analogue of Storey\u2019s adaptive version of the BH procedure. As shown in Figure 1, our simulations show that SAFFRON demonstrates the same types of advantages over its non-adaptive counterparts, such as LORD and alpha-investing. Furthermore, the ideas behind SAFFRON\u2019s derivation can provide a natural template for the design and analysis of a suite of other adaptive online methods.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we derive the SAFFRON algorithm from first principles, leaving the precise statement and the proof of a central tech-\nnical lemma for Section 3. In Section 4, we investigate the practical choice of tuning parameters, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our recommended choice using simulations. We end with a summary in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2. Deriving the SAFFRON Algorithm", "text": "Before deriving the SAFFRON algorithm, it is useful to recap a few concepts. By definition of a p-value, if the hypothesis Hi is truly null, then the corresponding p-value is stochastically larger than the uniform distribution (\u201csuperuniformly distributed,\u201d for short), meaning that:\nIf the null hypothesis Hi is true, then Pr{Pi \u2264 u} \u2264 u for all u \u2208 [0, 1].\n(1)\nFor any online FDR procedure, let the rejected set after t steps be denoted byR(t). More precisely, this set consists of all p-values among the first t ones for which the indicator for rejection is equal to 1; i.e., Rj : = 1 {Pj \u2264 \u03b1j} = 1, for all j \u2264 t. While we have already defined the classical FDP and FDR in the introduction, several authors, including Foster and Stine (2008), have considered a modified FDR, defined as:\nmFDR(t) : = E [ |H0 \u2229R(t)| ] E [|R(t)|] . (2)\nIn the sequel, we provide guarantees for both mFDR and FDR. Our guarantees on mFDR hold under the following weakening of (1). Define the filtration formed by the sequence of sigma-fields F t : = \u03c3(R1, . . . , Rt), and let \u03b1t : = ft(R1, . . . , Rt\u22121), where ft is an arbitrary function of the first t\u22121 indicators for rejection. Then, we say that the null p-values are conditionally super-uniformly distributed if the following holds:\nIf the null hypothesis Ht is true, then Pr { Pt \u2264 \u03b1t \u2223\u2223 F t\u22121} \u2264 \u03b1t. (3)"}, {"heading": "2.1. An Oracle FDP Estimate and a Naive Overestimate", "text": "To understand the motivation behind the new procedure, it is necessary to expand on an perspective on existing online FDR procedures, recently suggested by Ramdas et al. (2017). We begin by defining an oracle estimate of the FDP as:\nFDP\u2217(t) : =\n\u2211 j\u2264t,j\u2208H0 \u03b1j\n|R(t)| .\nThe word oracle indicates that FDP\u2217 cannot be calculated by the scientist, since H0 is unknown. Intuitively, the numerator \u2211 j\u2264t,j\u2208H0 \u03b1j overestimates the number of false discoveries, and FDP\u2217(t) overestimates the FDP, as formalized in the claim below:\nProposition 1. If the null p-values are conditionally superuniformly distributed (3), then we have:\n(a) E [ \u2211 j\u2264t,j\u2208H0 \u03b1j ] \u2265 E [ |H0 \u2229R(t)| ] ;\n(b) If FDP\u2217(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N, then mFDR(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N.\nFurther, if the null p-values are independent of each other and of the non-nulls, and {\u03b1t} is a monotone function of past rejections, then:\n(c) E [FDP\u2217(t)] \u2265 E [FDP(t)] \u2261 FDR(t) for all t \u2208 N;\n(d) The condition FDP\u2217(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N implies that FDR(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N.\nTo clarify, the word monotone means that \u03b1t is a coordinatewise non-decreasing function of the vector R1, . . . , Rt\u22121. Proposition 1 follows from the results of Ramdas et al. (2017), and we prove it in Subsection 3.1 for completeness. Even though FDP\u2217(t) cannot be directly calculated and used, Proposition 1 is a useful way to identify what would be ideally possible.\nOne natural way to convert FDP\u2217(t) to a truly empirical overestimate of FDP(t) is to define:\nF\u0302DPLORD(t) : =\n\u2211 j\u2264t \u03b1j\n|R(t)| .\nSince it is trivially true that F\u0302DPLORD(t) \u2265 FDP\u2217(t), we immediately obtain that Proposition 1 also holds with FDP\u2217(t) replaced by F\u0302DPLORD(t). The subscript LORD is used because Ramdas et al. (2017) point out that their variant of the LORD algorithm of Javanmard and Montanari (2017) can be derived by simply assigning \u03b1j in an online fashion to ensure that the condition F\u0302DPLORD(t) \u2264 \u03b1 is met for all times t."}, {"heading": "2.2. A Better Estimate of the Alpha-Wealth Spent on Testing Nulls", "text": "The main drawback of F\u0302DPLORD is that if the underlying (unknown) truth is such that the proportion of non-nulls (true signals) is non-negligible, then F\u0302DPLORD(t) is a very crude and overly conservative overestimate of FDP\u2217(t), and hence also of the true unknown FDP. With this drawback in mind, and knowing that we would expect non-nulls to typically have smaller p-values, we propose the following novel estimator:\nF\u0302DPSAFFRON(\u03bb)(t) \u2261 F\u0302DP\u03bb(t) : = \u2211 j\u2264t \u03b1j 1{Pj>\u03bbj} 1\u2212\u03bbj\n|R(t)| ,\nwhere {\u03bbj}\u221ej=1 is a predictable sequence of user-chosen parameters in the interval (0, 1). Here the term predictable means that \u03bbj is a deterministic function of the information available from time 1 to j \u2212 1, which will be formalized later. For simplicity, when \u03bbj is chosen to be a constant for all j, we will drop the subscript and just write \u03bb, and we will consider \u03bb = 1/2 as our default choice. SAFFRON is based on the idea that the numerator of F\u0302DP\u03bb is a much better estimator of the quantity \u2211 j\u2264t,j\u2208H0 \u03b1j than LORD\u2019s\nnaive estimate \u2211 j\u2264t \u03b1j .\nSo as to provide some intuition for why we expect F\u0302DP\u03bb to be a fairly tight estimate of FDP\u2217, note that 1{Pj>\u03bbj}1\u2212\u03bbj has a unit expectation whenever Pj is uniformly distributed (null), but would typically have a much smaller expectation whenever Pj is stochastically much smaller than uniform (non-null). The following theorem shows that, even though F\u0302DP\u03bb(t) is not necessarily always larger than FDP\u2217(t), a direct analog of Proposition 1 is nonetheless valid. In order to state this claim formally, we need to slightly modify the assumption (3). As before, denote by Rj : = 1 {Pj \u2264 \u03b1j} the indicator for rejection, and let Cj := 1 {Pj \u2264 \u03bbj} be the indicator for candidacy. Accordingly, we refer to the p-values for which Cj = 1 as candidates. Moreover, we let \u03b1t : = ft(R1, . . . , Rt\u22121, C1, . . . , Ct\u22121), where ft denotes an arbitrary function of the first t \u2212 1 indicators for rejection and candidacy, and define the filtration generated from sigma-fields F t : = \u03c3(R1, . . . , Rt, C1, . . . , Ct). With respect to this filtration, we introduce a conditional superuniformity condition on the null p-values similar to (3):\nIf the null hypothesis Ht is true, then Pr { Pt \u2264 \u03b1t \u2223\u2223 F t\u22121} \u2264 \u03b1t, (4) which can be rephrased as:\nE [ 1 {Pt > \u03b1t}\n1\u2212 \u03b1t \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121] \u2265 1 \u2265 E [1 {Pt \u2264 \u03b1t}\u03b1t\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121] .\nNote that again marginal super-uniformity (1) implies this condition, provided that the p-values are independent.\nTheorem 1. If the null p-values are conditionally superuniformly distributed (4), then we have:\n(a) E [ \u2211 j\u2264t,j\u2208H0 \u03b1j 1{Pj>\u03bbj} 1\u2212\u03bbj ] \u2265 E [ |H0 \u2229R(t)| ] ;\n(b) The condition F\u0302DP\u03bb(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N implies that mFDR(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N.\nFurther, if the null p-values are independent of each other and of the non-nulls, and {\u03b1t} is a monotone function of the vector R1, ..., Rt\u22121, C1, ..., Ct\u22121, then we additionally have:\n(c) E [ F\u0302DP\u03bb(t) ] \u2265 E [FDP(t)] \u2261 FDR(t) for all t \u2208 N;\n(d) The condition F\u0302DP\u03bb(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N implies that FDR(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all t \u2208 N.\nThe proof of this theorem is given in Section 3.2, and is based on a \u201creverse super-uniformity lemma\u201d that is discussed in the next section. This lemma, though of a technical nature, may be of independent interest in deriving new algorithms. The statements on mFDR control allow SAFFRON to be used in place of LORD in applications in which p-values are not independent, but are conditionally super-uniformly distributed, such as the MAB-FDR framework (based on multi-armed bandits) proposed by Yang et al. (2017)."}, {"heading": "2.3. The SAFFRON Algorithm for Constant \u03bb", "text": "We now present the SAFFRON algorithm at a high level. For simplicity, we consider the constant \u03bb setting, which performs well in experiments, though it may be a useful direction for future work to construct good heuristics for time-varying sequences {\u03bbj}\u221ej=1.\n1. Given a target FDR level \u03b1, the user first picks a constant \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), an initial wealth W0 < (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b1, and a positive non-increasing sequence {\u03b3j}\u221ej=1 of summing to one. For example, given a parameter s > 1, we might pick \u03b3j \u221d j\u2212s for some s > 1.\n2. We use the term \u201ccandidates\u201d to refer to p-values smaller than \u03bb, since SAFFRON will never reject a p-value larger than \u03bb. Recalling the indicator for candidacy Ct : = 1 {Pt \u2264 \u03bb}, and denoting by \u03c4j be the time of the j-th rejection (and setting \u03c40 = 0), define the candidates after the j-th rejection as Cj+ = Cj+(t) = \u2211t\u22121 i=\u03c4j+1 Ci.\n3. SAFFRON begins by allocation \u03b11 = min{\u03b31W0, \u03bb},\nand then at time t = 2, 3, . . ., it allocates:\n\u03b1t : = min{\u03bb, \u03b1\u0303t}, where \u03b1\u0303t : = W0\u03b3t\u2212C0++ ((1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b1\u2212W0)\u03b3t\u2212\u03c41\u2212C1+ + \u2211 j\u22652 (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b1\u03b3t\u2212\u03c4j\u2212Cj+ .\nIn words, SAFFRON starts off with an alpha-wealth W0 < (1\u2212\u03bb)\u03b1, never loses wealth when testing candidate p-values, gains wealth of (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b1 on every rejection except the first. If there is a significant fraction of non-nulls, and the signals are fairly strong, then SAFFRON may make more rejections than LORD.\nTo clarify, SAFFRON guarantees FDR control for any \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) and any chosen sequence {\u03b3j}\u221ej=1, but the algorithm\u2019s power, or ability to detect signals, varies as a function of these parameters. Given the minimal nature of our assumptions, there is no universally optimal constant or sequence: specifically, we do not make assumptions on the frequency of true signals, or on how strong they are, or on their order, all of which are factors that affect the power. We discuss reasonable default choices in the experimental section."}, {"heading": "2.4. Relationship to Other Procedures", "text": "Here, we compare SAFFRON to existing procedures in the literature, emphasizing commonalities that allow us to give a unified view of seemingly disparate algorithms.\nAlpha-investing. Even though the motivation that we have presented for SAFFRON relates it to the LORD algorithm, we find it interesting that the original alpha-investing algorithm of Foster and Stine (2008) is recovered by choosing \u03bbj = \u03b1j in F\u0302DP\u03bb, and attempting to ensure that F\u0302DP\u03bb(t) \u2264 \u03b1 for all times t \u2208 N. In order to see this fact, first note that with this choice of \u03bbj , the indicator 1 {Pj > \u03bbj} simply indicates when the j-th hypothesis is not rejected. Consequently, the numerator of F\u0302DP\u03bb reads as \u2211 j\u2264t \u03b1j 1\u2212\u03b1j 1 {j /\u2208 R(t)}. Hence, ensuring that F\u0302DP\u03bb(t) \u2264 \u03b1 at all times t \u2208 N, is equivalent to ensuring that \u2211 j\u2264t \u03b1j 1\u2212\u03b1j 1 {j /\u2208 R(t)} never exceeds \u03b1(|R(t)| \u2228 1), which, in the language of alpha-investing, is equivalent to ensuring that the algorithm\u2019s wealth never becomes negative.1 Just as Ramdas et al. (2017) were able to reinterpret and rederive LORD in terms of a particular estimate of the FDP, the current work allows us to reinterpret and rederive alpha-investing in terms of SAFFRON\u2019s FDP. However, our simulations demonstrate that despite this similarity, SAFFRON with \u03bbj = 1/2 is typically a more powerful algorithm than both LORD and alpha-investing.\n1Recall that the alpha-investing algorithm starts off with an alpha-wealth of \u03b1, reduces its alpha-wealth by \u03b1j\n1\u2212\u03b1j after tests\nthat fail to reject, and increase the wealth by \u03b1 on rejections.\nStorey-BH. In offline multiple testing, where all n pvalues are immediately available, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995) is a classical method for guaranteeing FDR control. BH estimates the FDP of the rejection set R(s) := {i : Pi \u2264 s} by F\u0302DPBH(s) : = n\u00b7s|R(s)| , which is a conservative estimate of the oracle FDP\u2217BH(s) : = |H0|\u00b7s |R(s)| (details in Supplementary Material). For independent pvalues, Storey et al. (2002; 2004) improved the BH method, by picking a constant \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), and calculating:\nF\u0302DPStBH(s) : = n \u00b7 s \u00b7 \u03c0\u03020 |R(s)| ,\nwhere \u03c0\u03020 is an estimate of the unknown proportion of nulls \u03c00 = |H0|/n computed as:\n\u03c0\u03020 : = 1 + \u2211n i=1 1 {Pi > \u03bb} n(1\u2212 \u03bb) .\nThen, this procedure, which we refer to as \u201cStorey-BH,\u201d calculates s\u0302StBH : = max{s : F\u0302DPStBH(s) \u2264 \u03b1} and rejects the setR(s\u0302StBH) which satisfies the bound FDR \u2264 \u03b1. Procedures such as Storey-BH are known in the multiple testing literature as adaptive procedures, since they automatically adapt to the unknown proportion of nulls.\nReturning to the setting of online FDR, what matters is not the proportion of nulls \u03c00, but instead a running estimate of the amount of alpha-wealth that was spent testing nulls thus far; this difference arises because, unlike the offline setting where all p-values are compared to the same level s\u0302, different p-values have to pass different thresholds \u03b1i. In light of the above discussion, it should be apparent that Storey-BH is to BH as SAFFRON is to LORD. In the offline context, Storey-BH is called an \u201cadaptive method\u201d (it is adaptive to the unknown null proportion) and in this sense, SAFFRON can be seen as an adaptive online FDR method.\nAccumulation tests. Note that E [2I(P > 1/2)] \u2265 1 for null p-values (with equality when they are exactly uniformly distributed, simply because \u222b 1 0\n2I(p > 1/2)dp = 1). One may actually use any non-decreasing function h such that\u222b 1 0 h(p)dp in the formula for F\u0302DP\u03bb. Such accumulation functions were studied (Li & Barber, 2017) in the (offline) context of ordered testing, and may seamlessly be transferred to the online setting considered here, yielding mFDR control using the same proof. In initial experiments, the use of other functions does not seem to yield any advantage, and under some additional assumptions in the offline ordered testing setting, the aforementioned authors argued that the step function (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u22121I(I > \u03bb) is asymptotically optimal for power. In this light, SAFFRON can also be seen as an online analog of adaptive SeqStep (Lei & Fithian, 2016), which is a variant of selective SeqStep (Barber & Cande\u0300s, 2015) and SeqStep (Li & Barber, 2017)."}, {"heading": "3. Proof of Theorem 1 Using a Reverse Super-Uniformity Lemma", "text": "In this section, we present a lemma that is central to the proof of FDR control for SAFFRON. We then use this lemma to prove Proposition 1 and Theorem 1. Let us first recall and set up some preliminary notation. In what follows, \u03b1t, \u03bbt are random variables in (0, 1) that always satisfy \u03b1t \u2264 \u03bbt. We denote the indicator for rejection at the t-th step by Rt : = 1 {Pt \u2264 \u03b1t}, and recall that since only p-values smaller than \u03bbt are candidates for rejection, we had earlier defined the indicator for candidacy as Ct : = 1 {Pt \u2264 \u03bbt}. If we denote C\u0304t = 1 \u2212 Ct, then it is clear that RtC\u0304t = 0, since Rt = 1 implies C\u0304t = 0 and C\u0304t = 1 implies Rt = 0, and it is also possible for Rt and C\u0304t to both equal 0. Also let R1:t : = {R1, . . . , Rt} and C1:t : = {C1, . . . , Ct}. As before, we consider the filtration F t : = \u03c3(R1:t, C1:t). In what follows, we insist that the sequences {\u03b1t}\u221et=1 and {\u03bbt}\u221et=1 are predictable, meaning that they are functions of the information available from time 1 to t \u2212 1 only; specifically, we insist that \u03b1t, \u03bbt are measurable with respect to the sigma-field F t\u22121. We will also require that the {\u03b1t} sequence is monotone, meaning that \u03b1t = ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121) for some coordinatewise nondecreasing function ft : {0, 1}2(t\u22121) \u2192 [0, \u03bbt]. The proof that SAFFRON as described in Subsection 2.3 satisfies this requirement is given in the Supplementary Material.\nRecall the definition (4) of conditional super-uniformity, as well as its equivalent rephrased form in the line after definition (4). Lemma 1 guarantees that for independent p-values, this statement holds true more generally.\nLemma 1. Assume that the p-values P1, P2, . . . are independent and let g : {0, 1}T \u2192 R be any coordinatewise non-decreasing function. Then, for any index t \u2264 T such that Ht \u2208 H0, we have:\nE [ ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)1 {Pt > \u03bbt}\n(1\u2212 \u03bbt)g(R1:T ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121] \u2265 E [ ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)\ng(R1:T ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121] \u2265 E [ 1 {Pt \u2264 ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)}\ng(R1:T ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121] . Proof. The second inequality is a consequence of superuniformity lemmas from past work (Ramdas et al., 2017; Javanmard & Montanari, 2017), so we only prove the first inequality. At a high level, the proof strategy is inverted, and we will hallucinate a vector with one element being set to 1, instead of being set to 0 in the aforementioned works.\nLetting P1:T = (P1, . . . , PT ) be the original vector of p-values, we define a \u201challucinated\u201d vector of p-values P\u0303 t\u219211:T : = (P\u03031, . . . , P\u0303T ) that equals P1:T , except that the\nt-th component is set to one:\nP\u0303i = { 1 if i = t Pi if i 6= t.\nDefine hallucinated candidate and rejection indicators as C\u0303i = 1 { P\u0303i \u2264 \u03bbi } and R\u0303i =\n1 { P\u0303i \u2264 fi(R\u03031:i\u22121, C\u03031:i\u22121) } respectively. Let\nR1:T = (R1, . . . , RT ) and R\u0303t\u219211:T = (R\u03031, . . . , R\u0303T ) denote the vector of rejections using P1:T and P\u0303 t\u219211:T , respectively. Similarly, let C1:T = (C1, . . . , CT ) and C\u0303t\u219211:T = (C\u03031, . . . , C\u0303T ) denote the vector of candidates using P1:T and P\u0303 t\u219211:T , respectively.\nBy construction, we have the following properties:\n1. R\u0303i = Ri and C\u0303i = Ci for all i < t, hence fi(R1:i\u22121, C1:i\u22121) = fi(R\u03031:i\u22121, C\u03031:i\u22121) for all i \u2264 t.\n2. R\u0303t = C\u0303t = 0, and hence R\u0303i \u2264 Ri for all i \u2265 t, due to monotonicity of the functions fi.\nHence, on the event {Pt > \u03bbt}, we have Rt = R\u0303t = 0 and Ct = C\u0303t = 0, and hence also R1:T = R\u0303t\u219211:T . This allows us to conclude that:\nft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)1 {Pt > \u03bbt} (1\u2212 \u03bbt)g(R1:T ) =\nft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)1 {Pt > \u03bbt} (1\u2212 \u03bbt)g(R\u0303t\u219211:T ) .\nSince R\u0303t\u219211:T is independent of Pt, we may take conditional expectations to obtain:\nE [ ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)1 {Pt > \u03bbt}\n(1\u2212 \u03bbt)g(R1:T ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121] = E [ ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)1 {Pt > \u03bbt}\n(1\u2212 \u03bbt)g(R\u0303t\u219211:T )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121 ]\n(i) \u2265 E\n[ ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)\ng(R\u0303t\u219211:T )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121 ]\n(ii) \u2265 E [ ft(R1:t\u22121, C1:t\u22121)\ng(R1:T ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 F t\u22121] , where inequality (i) follows by taking an expectation only with respect to Pt by invoking the conditional superuniformity property (4); and inequality (ii) follows because g(R1:T ) \u2265 g(R\u0303t\u219211:T ) since Ri \u2265 R\u0303i for all i by monotonicity of the online FDR rule.

We only run simulations since for real data, we would not know the ground truth and hence which discoveries are true or false.\nThe following two subsections separately analyze two experimental settings - one in which the p-values are computed from Gaussian observations, and another in which the pvalues under the alternative are drawn from a beta distribution. In both cases, SAFFRON outperforms the competing algorithms, with the exact level of performance depending on the choice of sequence {\u03b3j}. All experiments use a target FDR of \u03b1 = 0.05 and estimate the FDR and power by averaging over 200 independent trials. As previously mentioned, the constant sequence \u03bbj = 1/2 for all j was found to be particularly successful, so this is our default choice, and we drop the index for simplicity."}, {"heading": "4.1. Testing with Gaussian Observations", "text": "We use the simple experimental setup of testing the mean of a Gaussian distribution with T = 1000 components. More precisely, for each index i \u2208 {1, . . . , T}, the null hypothesis takes the form Hi : \u00b5i = 0. The observations consist of independent Gaussian variates Zi \u223c N(\u00b5i, 1), which are converted into one-sided p-values using the transform Pi = \u03a6(\u2212Zi), where \u03a6 is the standard Gaussian CDF. The motivation for one-sided conversion lies in A/B testing, where one wishes to detect larger effects, not smaller. The parameter \u00b5i is chosen according to a mixture model:\n\u00b5i = { 0 with probability 1\u2212 \u03c01 F1 with probability \u03c01,\nwhere the random variable F1 is of the form N(\u00b5c, 1) for some constant \u00b5c.

The constant infinite sequence \u03b3j \u221d log(j\u22282)je\u221alog j , where the proportionality constant is determined so that the sequence sums to one, was shown to be asymptotically optimal for testing Gaussian means via the LORD method in the paper (Javanmard & Montanari, 2017). Since SAFFRON loses wealth only when\n2The code for all simulations described in this section is available at: https://github.com/tijana-zrnic/SAFFRONcode\ntesting non-candidates whereas LORD loses wealth at every step, it is expected to behave more conservatively and not use up its wealth at the same rate, conditioned on both using the same sequence {\u03b3j}. For this reason, informally speaking, it can reuse this leftover wealth, hence the sequence {\u03b3j} chosen for SAFFRON is more aggressive, in the sense that more wealth is concentrated around the beginning of the sequence. In particular, we choose sequences of the form \u03b3j \u221d j\u2212s, where the parameter s > 1 controls the aggressiveness of the procedure; the greater the constant s, the more wealth is concentrated around small values of j. We also consider these sequences for LORD, thus observing the difference in performance resulting from using a more aggressive sequence in the regime of a finite sequence of pvalues. Figures showing the power and FDR of SAFFRON and LORD by varying the aggressiveness of sequence {\u03b3j} are in the Supplementary Material.\nIn Figure 2 we consider F1 = N(2, 1), and compare the level of performance of alpha-investing, SAFFRON and LORD, the latter two using the highest performing sequence chosen among six possible sequences. Figure 1 demonstrates the same comparison for a similar but somewhat easier testing problem, with F1 = N(3, 1). Experiments indicate that increasing the fraction of non-null hypotheses allows SAFFRON to achieve a faster increase of power than LORD, thus performing considerably better than both LORD and the alpha-investing procedure in settings with a great number of non-null observations."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Importantly, \u03b1k must be a function of the past, and cannot depend on Pk or any of the later unseen p-values, and must be chosen to guarantee that for any time t, the FDR up to time t is less than some pre-determined quantity \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). In this work, we present a powerful new framework for online FDR control that we refer to as \u201cSAFFRON\u201d. Like older alphainvesting algorithms, SAFFRON starts off with an error budget (called alpha-wealth) that it intelligently allocates to different tests over time, earning back some alpha-wealth whenever it makes a new discovery. However, unlike older methods, SAFFRON\u2019s threshold sequence is based on a novel estimate of the alpha fraction that it allocates to true null hypotheses. In the offline setting, algorithms that employ an estimate of the proportion of true nulls are called \u201cadaptive\u201d, hence SAFFRON can be seen as an online analogue of the offline Storey-BH adaptive procedure. Just as Storey-BH is typically more powerful than the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure under independence, we demonstrate that SAFFRON is also more powerful than its non-adaptive counterparts such as LORD.
