0	34	The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a healthcare classification system maintained by the World Health Organization (Organization et al., 1978).
2	18	It is widely used for reporting diseases and health conditions, assisting in medical reimbursement decisions, collecting morbidity and mortality statistics, to name a few.
4	18	Medical coders review the diagnosis descriptions written by physicians in the form of textual phrases and sentences, and (if necessary) other information in the electronic health record of a clinical episode, then manually attribute the appropriate ICD codes by following the coding guidelines (O’malley et al., 2005).
7	21	For a node representing a disease C, the children of this node represent the subtypes of C. In many cases, the difference between disease subtypes is very subtle.
13	37	The cost incurred by coding errors and the financial investment spent on improving coding quality are estimated to be $25 billion per year in the US (Lang, 2007; Farkas and Szarvas, 2008).
21	16	Second, the diagnosis descriptions and the textual descriptions of ICD codes are written in quite different styles even if they refer to the same disease.
22	23	In particular, the textual description of an ICD code is formally and precisely worded, while diagnosis descriptions are usually written by physicians in an informal and ungrammatical way, with telegraphic phrases, abbreviations, and typos.
26	21	In many cases, two closely related diagnosis descriptions need to be mapped onto a single combination ICD code.
27	25	On the other hand, physicians may write two health conditions into one diagnosis description which should be mapped onto two ICD codes under such circumstances.
90	72	The model takes the ICD-code tree and diagnosis descriptions (DDs) of a patient as inputs and assigns a set of ICD codes to the patient.
94	20	The representation aims at simultaneously capturing the semantics of each code and the hierarchical relationship among codes.
116	17	It consists of a bottom-up TLSTM and a top-down TLSTM, which produce two hidden states h↑ and h↓ at each node in the tree.
127	21	The bottom-up TLSTM composes the semantics of children (representing sub-diseases) and merge them into the current node, which hence captures child-to-parent relationship.
128	26	The top-down TLSTM makes each node inherit the semantics of its parent, which captures parent-to-child relation.
130	20	For the diagnosis descriptions of a patient, we use an SLSTM network to encode each description individually.
146	16	We use an adversarial learning (Goodfellow et al., 2014) approach to reconcile the different writing styles of diagnosis descriptions (DDs) and code descriptions (CDs).
147	18	The basic idea is: after encoded, if a description cannot be discerned to be a DD or a CD, then the difference in their writing styles is eliminated.
158	24	Adversarial learning is performed by solving this problem: max Ws min Wd Ladv = R∑ r=1 CE(g(f(tr;Ws);Wd), yr) (5) The discriminative network tries to differentiate DDs from CDs by minimizing this classification loss while the encoder maximizes this loss so that DDs and CDs are not distinguishable.
160	15	For the D(l) codes assigned to patient l, without loss of generality, we assume the order is 1 2 · · · D(l) (the order is given by human coders as ground-truth in the MIMIC-III dataset).
172	28	Out of the 6,984 unique codes, we selected 2,833 codes that have the top frequencies to perform the study.
189	19	Table 2 shows the average sensitivity and specificity scores achieved by these methods on the test set.
191	61	First, removing tree LSTM largely degrades performance: the sensitivity and specificity of No-TLSTM is 0.23 and 0.28 respectively while our full model (which uses bidirectional TLSTM) achieves 0.29 and 0.33 respectively.
199	22	This is incorrect because 585.2 and 585.4 are the children of 585 (chronic kidney disease) and the severity level of this disease cannot simultaneously be mild and severe.
219	15	With AL, our model successfully matches this DD to a ground-truth code: 414.01 (coronary atherosclerosis of native coronary artery).
242	24	AM successfully maps this DD to two codes: (1) 428.0 (congestive heart failure, unspecified); (2) 428.30 (diastolic heart failure, unspecified).
243	36	Without AM, this DD is mapped only to 428.0.
244	20	In addition to evaluating the four modules individually, we also compared our full model with four other baselines proposed by (Larkey and Croft, 1996; Franz et al., 2000; Pestian et al., 2007; Kavuluru et al., 2013, 2015; Koopman et al., 2015) for ICD coding.
245	16	As can be seen, our approach achieves much better sensitivity and specificity scores.
246	101	The reason that our model works better is two-fold.
252	19	First, the tree-of-sequences LSTM network effectively discourages the co-selection of sibling codes and promotes the co-assignment of clinicallyrelevant codes.
