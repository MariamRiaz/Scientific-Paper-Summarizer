0	53	Given a large symmetrical network, we are interested in the global testing problem where we use the adjacency matrix of the network to test whether the network consists of only one community or that it consists of multiple communities, where some nodes may have mixed memberships.
1	11	Real networks frequently have severe degree heterogeneity.
3	19	To tackle the problem, Karrer and Newman (2011) proposed the DegreeCorrected Block Model (DCBM).
5	6	We adopt a Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership (DCMM) model (Jin et al., 2017).
6	26	DCMM can be viewed as an extension of DCBM, but allows for mixed memberships.
7	12	Suppose the network has n nodes and K perceivable communities C1, C2, .
9	16	Let A ∈ Rn,n be the adjacency matrix, where Aij = 1 if nodes i and j have an edge, and Aij = 0 otherwise (all diagonal entries of A are 0 as we don’t treat a node as connecting to itself).
11	9	Moreover, for n degree heterogeneity parameters θ1, θ2, .
15	11	Let Θ be the n× n diagonal matrix Θ = diag(θ1, .
18	22	Many recent works use the “Random Degree Parameter (RDP)” model (which is narrower than ours): fixing a scaling parameter αn > 0 and a density function f over (0,∞) where the first a few moments of f are finite, and especially the second moment is 1, we assume (θi/αn) iid∼ f , i = 1, 2, .
26	7	The likelihood ratio test is not applicable, for there are many unknown parameters (θ1, π1), (θ2, π2), ..., (θn, πn).
30	6	• (GL1) No mixed-membership: all πi are degenerate.
34	19	Gao and Lafferty (2017) made an interesting observation that the effect of the degree heterogeneity parameters θ1, θ2, .
35	16	, θn is largely canceled out in the EZ test, and the test statistic approximately equals to 0 under the null, regardless of what θ1, θ2, .
36	26	This allows us to find a convenient way to map out the rejection region.
38	30	In this paper, we introduce a class of test statistics by counting the number of graphlets in the network.
39	24	Fixing a small m ≥ 1, we count two kinds of graphlets: length-m paths and m-cycles.
47	43	See Section 3.2 for more comparison.
49	22	Jin (2015) pointed out that θ1, θ2, .
50	89	, θn are required to model severe degree heterogeneity, but they turn out to be nuisance parameters, the effects of which can be largely removed with a proper construction of statistics.
52	8	For example, we can combine our idea with those in community detection (e.g. Jin (2015), Chen et al. (2018), Qin and Rohe (2013)) to estimate the number of communities K.
53	6	The testing problem (2) is hard for there are so many unknown parameters: P, θ1, .
54	35	, θn, which are required to model the severe degree heterogeneity of real networks, are especially hard to deal with for they vary significantly from one to another.
55	41	What we need is therefore a smart test statistic that • does not vary significantly as θ = (θ1, θ2, .
56	10	, θn)′ varies, and has a tractable limiting distribution (so it is easy to map out the rejection region), • is powerful in differentiating the null and alternative.
57	24	Our idea is to use the graphlet-count statistics.
58	15	In a network, we say a path is a “self-avoiding path” if it doesn’t intersect with itself, and a “cycle” if it is a closed path that does not intersect with itself.
64	27	Let 1n be the n-dimensional vector of 1’s and let θ = (θ1, θ2, .
65	32	We use (·, ·) to denote the inner product of two vectors.
66	33	The K ×K matrix G ≡ Π′Θ2Π and the vector η ∈ RK play a key role.
