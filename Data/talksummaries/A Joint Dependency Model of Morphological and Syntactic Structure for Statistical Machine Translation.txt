8	29	Our representation encodes syntactic and morphological structure jointly, allowing a single model to learn the translation of both.
9	23	Specifically, we work with a string-to-tree model with GHKM-style rules (Galley et al., 2006), and a relational dependency language model (Sennrich, 2015).
10	23	We focus on the representation of German syntax and morphology in an English-to-German system, and two morphologically complex word classes in German that are challenging for translation, compounds and particle verbs.
11	21	German makes heavy use of compounding, and compounds such as Abwasserbehandlungsanlage ‘waste water treatment plant’ are translated into complex noun phrases in other languages, such as French station d’épuration des eaux résiduaires.
12	13	German particle verbs are difficult to model because their surface realization differs depending on the finiteness of the verb and the type of clause.
13	16	Verb particles are separated from the finite verb in 2081 main clauses, but prefixed to the verb in subordinated clauses, or when the verb is non-finite.
14	20	The infinitive marker zu ’to’, which is normally a premodifying particle, appears as an infix in particle verbs.
16	29	The main focus of research on compound splitting has been on the splitting algorithm (Popovic et al., 2006; Nießen and Ney, 2000; Weller et al., 2014; Macherey et al., 2011).
18	24	For splitting, we use an approach similar to (Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010), with segmentation candidates identified by a finite-state morphology (Schmid et al., 2004; Sennrich and Kunz, 2014), and statistical evidence from the training corpus to select a split (Koehn and Knight, 2003).
25	46	Importantly, the head of the compound is also the parent of the determiners and attributes in the noun phrase, which makes a bigram dependency language model sufficient to enforce agreement.
28	34	For German particle verbs, we define a common representation that abstracts away from the various surface realizations (see Table 1).
29	12	Separated verb particles are reordered to be the closest premodifier of the verb.
55	16	To restore the original representation, we start from the tree output of the stringto-tree decoder.
56	21	Merging compounds is trivial: all segments and linking elements can be identified by the tree structure, and are concatenated.
59	23	3. finite verbs that head a main clause have the particle moved to the right clause bracket.5 Previous work on particle verb translation into German proposed to predict the position of particles with an n-gram language model (Nießen and Ney, 2001).
61	13	Our rules only produce projective trees.
74	14	On newstest2014, the improvement is almost twice of that reported in related work (Williams et al., 2014), which also uses a hierarchical representation of compounds, albeit one that does not allow for dependency modelling.
80	34	Table 3 shows that the baseline system severely undergenerates compounds and separated/infixed particle verbs.
81	27	Binarization, compound splitting, and particle verb restructuring all contribute to bringing the distribution of compounds and particle verbs closer to the reference.
83	54	The full system is competitive with official submissions to the WMT 2015 shared translation tasks.
84	47	It outperforms our submission (Williams et al., 2015) by 0.4 BLEU, and outperforms other phrase-based and syntax-based submissions by 0.8 BLEU or more.
87	16	We perform a synthetic experiment to test our claim that a dependency representation allows for the modelling of agreement between morphemes.
88	25	For 200 rare compounds [that would be split by our compound splitter] in the newstest2014/5 references, we artificially introduce agreement errors by changing the gender of the determiner.
90	22	We measure the ability of language models to prefer (give a higher probability to) the original reference sentence over the erroneous one.
93	87	In the split representation, the RDLM reliably prefers the correct agreement (96.5% accuracy), whilst the performance of the 5-gram model even deteriorates (to 60% accuracy).
94	32	This is because the gender of the first segment(s) is irrelevant, or even misleading, for agreement.
96	26	Our main contribution is that we exploit the hierarchical structure of morphemes to model them jointly with syntax in a dependency-based stringto-tree SMT model.
97	100	We describe the dependency annotation of two morphologically complex word classes in German, compounds and particle verbs, and show that our tree representation yields improvements in translation quality of 1.4–1.8 BLEU in the WMT English–German translation task.9 The principle of jointly representing syntactic and morphological structure in dependency trees can be applied to other language pairs, and we expect this to be helpful for languages with a high degree of morphological synthesis.
98	59	However, the annotation needs to be adapted to the respective languages.
99	36	For example, French compounds such as arc-en-ciel ’rainbow’ are head-initial, in contrast to head-final Germanic compounds.
