0	73	A question that remains unresolved in work on discourse coherence is the nature and number of relations that can hold between clauses in a coherent text (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Stede, 2012).
1	151	Our earlier work (Rohde et al., 2015, 2016) showed that, in the presence of explicit discourse adverbials, people also infer additional discourse relations that they take to hold jointly with those associated with the adverbials.
2	45	For example, in: (1) It’s too far to walk.
3	106	people infer a RESULT relation in the context of the adverbial instead, which itself signals that the bus stands in a SUBSTITUTION relation to walking.
4	43	We showed this using crowdsourced conjunctioninsertion experiments (Rohde et al., 2015, 2016), in which participants were asked to insert into the gap between two discourse segments, a conjunction that best expressed how they took the segments to be related.
5	20	Rohde et al. (2017) also asked participants to select any other conjunctions that they took to convey the same sense as their “best” choice.
8	17	But Rohde et al. (2015, 2016) also showed participants often selecting conjunctions that signal different coherence relations than those selected by other participants.
44	62	Our materials consisted of passages containing an explicit discourse adverbial, preceded by a gap, which effectively separated the passage into two segments.
46	22	Participants were asked to read each passage and choose the conjunction(s) that best expressed how the two segments link together.
50	23	To further control data quality, we included 6 catch trials with an expected correct conjunction like “To be ______ not to be”.
55	34	The fourth adverbial, after all, allows us to test a hypothesis that the inferred connection between clauses is not driven by the adverbial alone.
62	32	Passages were presented in batches of 34, one batch per day for three days.
71	26	The second hypothesis is that the prevalence of and substitutability between SO and OR in (2) depends on the immediately adjacency of the two segments.
72	17	This was suggested by participant choices of BUT (cf.
76	33	I don’t know where I heard that ______ in other words an area the size of Central Park disappears every 16 minutes.
80	27	(8) Typically, a cast-iron wood-burning stove is 60 percent efficient.
84	18	If our hypotheses are confirmed, it will show that manipulating the immediately preceding segment can shift participants’ preference from relations associated with OR and SO (ALTERNATIVE and CONSEQUENCE) to relations of CONTRAST or CONCESSION.
85	23	This would then be evidence that adjacency affects what coherence relations participants take to be available.
87	18	Given that otherwise has several different functions (described below), we hypothesize that different response splits arise from the lexical semantics of otherwise, combined with inference as to the function of the otherwise clause in a given passage.
117	24	To test this hypothesis, we created 16 minimal pairs of passages containing instead, one of which emphasized the information structural parallelism between the clauses, as in (13a), and another variant (13b) that de-emphasized that parallelism in favor of a causal link implied by a downward-entailing construction such as too X (Webber, 2013).
129	29	5.1 In other words: Inference and adjacency Section 4.1 lays out the joint hypotheses that inferred relations in passages with in other words reflect two components of the lexical semantics of the adverbial (leading to the OR∼SO split) and that the presence of intervening material before in other words reduces the availability of those relations, favoring BUT instead.
160	56	For ARGUMENTATION, at least one paraphrase always corresponded to EXCEPTION, while for ENUMERATION, it did so for most of these tokens (9/14).
161	28	While there was less agreement when participants offered multiple paraphrases for researcherassigned EXCEPTION, there may be too few tokens here to draw any kind of conclusion.
164	40	5.3 Instead: Inference from a single manipulated property On aggregate, participants responded very differently to the parallel and causal variants of instead passages (cf.
169	35	They could have been playing football in the village green _____ instead they played in the street.
170	94	They didn’t like playing football in the village green _____ instead they played in the street.
182	46	We trust that the fact that the other 14 passages demonstrate the predicted effect provides sufficient evidence that splits in participant responses are not simply a result of the presence of a discourse adverbial.
185	18	Specifically, we have shown that participant responses to systematically manipulated passages involving discourse adverbials can be explained in terms of both the lexical semantics of discourse adverbials and properties of the passages that contain them.
186	96	As the conjunctions chosen by participants convey senses that differ from those of the discourse adverbials, we also provided evidence for the simultaneous availability of multiple coherence relations that arise from both explicit signals and inference.
187	22	We hope the reader is now convinced that, in both psycholinguistic research on discourse coherence and computational work on discourse parsing, one needs to identify and examine evidence for coherence involving more than one discourse relation.
