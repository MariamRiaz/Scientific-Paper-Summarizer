0	15	Many natural language understanding situations require reasoning with respect to numbers or quanti- ∗Most of the work was done when the authors were at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign.
2	22	Math word problems form a natural abstraction to a lot of these quantitative reasoning problems.
3	22	Consequently, there has been a growing interest in developing automated methods to solve math word problems (Kushman et al., 2014; Hosseini et al., 2014; Roy and Roth, 2015).
4	48	Understanding and solving math word problems involves interpreting the natural language description of mathematical concepts, as well as understanding their interaction with the physical world.
12	21	Some of these involve understanding comparisons, transactions, and the application of math or physics formulas.
38	30	The works of Hosseini et al. (2014) and Mitra and Baral (2016) focus on arithmetic problems involving only addition and subtraction.
41	27	Both require extensive annotations for intermediate steps (verb classification for Hosseini et al. (2014), alignment of numbers to formulas for Mitra and Baral (2016), etc).
69	14	Transfer: This involves understanding the transfer of objects from one person to another.
103	21	To use dimensional analysis, one needs to extract the units of numbers as well as the relations between the units.
104	17	Consider the following excerpt of a word problem: “Stephen has 5 bags.
105	19	Knowing that the unit of 5 is “bag” and the effective unit of 4 is “apples per bag”, allows us to infer that the numbers can be multiplied to obtain the total number of apples.
108	19	In our example, the unit of 4 is “apple”, and the rate component of 4 is “bag”.
109	18	We define variables Unit1 and Rate1 to denote the unit and the rate component of the first number respectively.
129	14	For the above example, the applicable declarative rule is: [Sibling(Number1,Number2)]⇒ Addition The rules for the part-whole concept can generate addition and subtraction operations.
131	22	Note that all the declarative rules are designed to determine an operation between two numbers only.
135	17	In order to combine two numbers mentioned in x, we first predict a concept k, and then we choose a declarative knowledge rule r from k. The rule r generates the math operation needed to combine the two numbers.
137	17	To combine 6 and 9, we first decide on the transfer concept, and then choose an appropriate rule under the transfer to generate the operation.
151	25	In order to discriminate between multiple candidate solution expressions of a word problem x, we score them using a linear model over features extracted from the derivation of the solution.
152	16	Our scoring function has the following form: SCORE(x, y) = ∑ o∈ (y) wkφk(x, k o) + wrφr(x, r o) where φk(x, ko) and φr(x, ro) are feature vectors related to concept ko, and declarative rule ro, respectively, and wk and wr are the corresponding weight vectors.
225	18	We compare to the top performing systems for arithmetic word problems.
235	19	The performance of KNOWLEDGE is on par or lower than some of the existing systems.
238	36	Systems which remember these biases get an undue advantage in evaluation.
258	34	We manually pruned problems which did not yield the desired solution a′, or were too different from the input problem p. This procedure gave us a set of 661 new word problems, which we refer to as Perturb.
271	33	This shows that declarative knowledge allows the system to learn the correct abstractions, even from biased datasets.
307	78	We can potentially expand our rule based system to detect those, or replace it by a learned module like Roy and Roth (2015).
310	17	For the example in Table 6, we fail to detect the coreference between “team member” and “people”.
312	23	Our knowledge based approach outperforms all other systems, and also learns better abstractions from biased datasets.
313	46	Given that the variability in text is much larger than the number of declarative rules that governs Math word problems, we believe that this is a good way to introduce Math knowledge to a natural language understanding system.
316	53	A straightforward approach can be to augment news documents with a question asking for the required information, and treating this augmented news document as a math word problem.
