Our Contributions", "text": "The main contribution of this paper is a simple, stochastic update algorithm Convotron (Algorithm 1) for provably learning the above convolutional architecture.

Prior work has focused on analyzing SGD in the realizable/noiseless setting with the caveat of requiring either disjoint patches (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017; Du et al., 2017b) with Gaussian inputs or technical conditions linking the underlying true parameters and the \u201ccloseness of patches\u201d (Du et al., 2017a).\nIn contrast, our conditions depend only on the patch structure itself and can be efficiently verified. Commonly used patch structures in computer vision applications such as 1D/2D grids satisfy our conditions. Additionally, we require only that the underlying distribution on samples is symmetric and induces a covariance matrix on the patches with polynomially bounded condition number1. All prior work handles only continuous distributions. Another major difference from prior work is that we give guarantees using purely empirical updates. That is, we do not require an assumption that we have access to exact quantities such as the population gradient of the loss function.\nWe further show that in the commonly studied setting of Gaussian inputs and non-overlapping patches, updating with respect to a single non-overlapping patch is sufficient to guarantee convergence. This indicates that the Gaussian/nooverlap assumption is quite strong."}, {"heading": "1.2. Our Approach", "text": "Our approach is to exploit the monotonicity of the activation function instead of the strong convexity of the loss surface. We use ideas from isotonic regression and extend them in the context of convolutional networks. These ideas have been successful for learning generalized linear models (Kakade et al., 2011), improperly learning fully connected, depththree neural networks (Goel & Klivans, 2017b), and learning graphical models (Klivans & Meka, 2017)."}, {"heading": "1.3. Related Work", "text": "It is known that in the worst case, learning even simple neural networks is computationally intractable. For example, in the non-realizable (agnostic) setting, it is known that learning a single ReLU (even for bounded distributions and unit norm hidden weight vectors) with respect to square-loss is as hard as learning sparse parity with noise (Goel et al., 2016), a notoriously difficult problem from computational learning theory. For learning one hidden layer convolutional networks, Brutzkus and Globerson (Brutzkus & Glober-\n1Brutzkus and Globerson (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017) proved that the problem, even with disjoint patches, is NP-hard in general, and so some distributional assumption is needed for efficient learning.\nson, 2017) proved that distribution-free recoverability of the unknown weight vector is NP-hard, even if we restrict to disjoint patch structures.\nAs such, a major open question is to discover the mildest assumptions that lead to polynomial-time learnability for simple neural networks. In this paper, we consider the very popular class of convolutional neural networks (for a summary of other recent approaches for learning more general architectures see (Goel & Klivans, 2017a)). For convolutional networks, all prior research has focused on analyzing conditions under which (Stochastic) Gradient Descent converges to the hidden weight vector in polynomial-time.\nAlong these lines, Brutzkus and Globerson (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017) proved that with respect to the spherical Gaussian distribution and for disjoint (non-overlapping) patch structures, gradient descent recovers the weight vector in polynomial-time. Zhong et al. (Zhong et al., 2017a) showed that gradient descent combined with tensor methods can recover one hidden layer involving multiple weight vectors but still require a Gaussian distribution and nonoverlapping patches. Du et al. (Du et al., 2017b) proved that gradient descent recovers a hidden weight vector involved in a type of two-layer convolutional network under the assumption that the distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the patches are disjoint, and the learner has access to the true population gradient of the loss function.\nWe specifically highlight the work of Du, Lee, and Tian (Du et al., 2017a), who proved that gradient descent recovers a hidden weight vector in a one-layer convolutional network under certain technical conditions that are more general than the Gaussian/no-overlap patch scenario. Their conditions involve a certain \u201calignment\u201d of the unknown patch structure, the hidden weight vector, and the (continuous) marginal distribution. However, it is unclear which concrete patch-structure/distributional combinations their framework captures. We also note that all of the above results assume there is no noise; i.e.,, they work in the realizable setting.\nOther related works analyzing gradient descent with respect to the Gaussian distribution (but for non-convolutional networks) include (Soltanolkotabi, 2017; Ge et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2017b; Tian, 2016; Li & Yuan, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).\nIn contrast, we consider an alternative to gradient descent, namely Convotron, that is based on isotonic regression. The exploration of alternative algorithms to gradient descent is a feature of our work, as it may lead to new algorithms for learning deeper networks."}, {"heading": "2.

We denote the input-label distribution by D over input drawn from X and label drawn from Y .

Given input x \u2208 Rn, the network computes k patches of size r where each patch\u2019s location is indicated by matrices P1, . . . , Pk \u2208 {0, 1}r\u00d7n.

Note we do not require that the noise is independent of the instance.2\n(b) Distribution: The marginal distribution on the input space DX is a symmetric distribution about the origin, that is, for all x, PX (x) = PX (\u2212x). (c) Patch Structure: The minimum eigenvalue of P\u03a3 :=\u2211k i,j=1 Pi\u03a3P T j where \u03a3 = Ex\u223cDX [xxT ] and the max-\nimum eigenvalue of P := \u2211k i,j=1 PiP T j are polynomially bounded.\n(d) Activation Function: The activation function has the following form:\n\u03c3(x) = { x if x \u2265 0 \u03b1x otherwise\nfor some constant \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. 2In the realizable setting, as in previous works, it is assumed\nthat \u03be = 0.\nThe distributional assumption includes common assumptions such as Gaussian inputs, but is far less restrictive. For example, we do not require the distribution to be continuous nor do we require it to have identity covariance. In Section 4, we show that commonly used patch schemes from computer vision satisfy our patch requirements. The assumption on activation functions is satisfied by popular activations such as ReLU (\u03b1 = 0) and leaky ReLU (\u03b1 > 0)."}, {"heading": "2.1.

Experiments: SGD vs Convotron", "text": "To further support our theoretical findings, we empirically compare the performance of SGD (Algorithm 3) with our algorithm Convotron. We measure performance based on the failure probability, that is, the fraction of runs the algorithm fails to converge on randomly initialized runs (the randomness is over both the choice of initialization for SGD and the draws from the distribution). More formally, we say that the algorithm fails if the closeness in l2-norm of the difference of the final weight vector obtained (wT ) and the true weight parameter (w\u2217), that is, ||wT \u2212 w\u2217|| is greater than a threshold \u03b8. We choose this measure because in practice, due to the high computation time of training neural networks, random restarts are expensive.\nIn the experiments, given a fixed true weight vector, for varying learning rates (increments of 0.01), we choose 50 random initializations and run the two algorithms with them as starting points. We plot the failure probability (\u03b8 = 0.1) with varying learning rate. Note that the lowest learning rate we use is 0.01 as making the learning rate too small requires high number of iterations for convergence for both algorithms.\nWe first test the performance on a simple 1D convolution case with (n, k, d, T ) = (8, 4, 1, 6000) and 2D case with (n1, n2, k1, k2, d1, d2, T ) = (5, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1, 15000) on inputs drawn from a normalized (l2 norm 1) Gaussian distribution with identity covariance matrix. We adversarially choose a fixed weight vector (l2-norm 1). For example, we take the vector to be [1,\u22121, 1,\u22121] in the 1D case and normalize. This weight vector can be viewed as an edge detection filter, that is, counting the number of times image goes from black (negative) to white (positive). Figure 3 (Top) shows that SGD has a small data dependent range where it succeeds but may fail with almost 0.5 probability outside this region whereas Convotron always returns a good solution for small enough \u03b7 chosen according to\nTheorem 2. The failure points observed for SGD show the prevalence of bad local minima where SGD gets stuck.\nFor the second experiment, we choose a fixed weight vector for which SGD performs well with very high probability on a normalized Gaussian input distribution with identity covariance matrix (see Figure 3 (Bottom-left)). However, on choosing a different covariance matrix with higher condition number \u223c 60, the performance of SGD worsens whereas Convotron always succeeds (see Figure 3 (Bottom-Right)). The covariance matrix is generated by choosing random matrices followed by symmetrizing them and adding cI for c > 0 to make the eigenvalues positive.\nThese experiments demonstrate that techniques for finetuning SGD\u2019s learning rate are necessary, even for very simple architectures. In contrast, no fine-tuning is necessary for Convotron: the correct learning rate can be easily computed given the learner\u2019s desired patch structure and estimate of the covariance martix."}, {"heading": "7.
