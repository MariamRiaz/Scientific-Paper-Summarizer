Introduction", "text": "In this paper, we aim at solving the following convex constrained optimization problem:\nmin x\u2208Rd f(x), s.t. c(x) \u2264 0, (1)\nwhere f(x) is a smooth or non-smooth convex function and c(x) is a lower-semicontinuous and convex function. The problem can find applications in machine learning, signal processing, statistics, marketing optimization, and etc. For example, in distance metric learning one needs to learn a positive semi-definite (PSD) matrix such that similar examples are close to each other and dissimilar examples are far from each other (Weinberger et al., 2006; Xing et al., 2003), where the positive semi-definite constraint can be cast into a convex inequality constraint. Another example arising in compressive sensing is to minimize the `1 norm of high-dimensional vector subject to a measurement constraint (Cande\u0300s & Wakin, 2008). Although general interiorpoint methods can be applied to solve the problem with linear convergence, they suffer from exceedingly high computational cost per-iteration. Another solution is to employ the projected gradient (PG) method (Nesterov, 2004) or the conditional gradient (CG) method (Frank & Wolfe, 1956), where the PG method needs to compute the projection into the constrained domain at each iteration and CG needs to solve a linear optimization problem under the constraint. However, for many constraints (e.g., PSD, quadratic constraints) both projection into the constrained domain and the linear optimization under the constraint are time-consuming, which restrict their capabilities to solving these problems.\nRecently, there emerges a new direction towards addressing the challenge of expensive projection that is to reduce the number of projections. In the seminal paper (Mahdavi et al., 2012), the authors have proposed two algorithms with only one projection at the end of iterations for non-smooth convex and strongly convex optimization, respectively. The idea of both algorithms is to move the constraint function into the objective function and to control the violation of constraint for intermediate solutions. While their developed algorithms enjoy an optimal convergence rate for nonsmooth optimization (i.e., O(1/ 2) iteration complexity)\nand a close-to-optimal convergence rate for strongly convex optimization (i.e., O\u0303(1/ ) 1), there still lack of theory and algorithms with reduced projections and faster rates for smooth convex optimization and for convex optimization without strong convexity assumptions.\nIn this paper, we make significant contributions by developing a richer theory of convex constrained optimization with reduced projections and faster rates. To be specific,\n\u2022 we develop a general framework and theory of optimization with only one projection, where any favorable smooth or non-smooth convex optimization algorithms can be employed to solve the intermediate augmented unconstrained objective function. We discuss in full details the applicability of the proposed algorithms to problems with polyhedral, quadratic or PSD constraints.\n\u2022 Applying the general theory to smooth convex optimization 2 with Nesterov\u2019s accelerated gradient methods yields an iteration complexity of O(1/ ) with only one projection. In addition, when equipped with an optimal algorithm for strongly convex optimization the general theory implies the optimal iteration complexity of O(1/ ) for strongly convex optimization with only one projection. For smooth and strongly convex optimization, the general theory implies an iteration complexity of O(1/ \u03b2) where \u03b2 \u2208 (1/2, 1) with only one projection and a sufficiently large number of iterations.\n\u2022 Building on the general framework and theory, we further develop an improved theory with faster convergence rates for non-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of projections. In particular, we show that under a mild local error bound condition, the iteration complexities can be reduced to O\u0303(1/ 2(1\u2212\u03b8)) for non-smooth optimization and O\u0303(1/ 1\u2212\u03b8) for smooth optimization, where \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1] is a constant in the local error bound condition that characterizes the local growth rate of functional values. To our knowledge, these are the best convergence results with only a logarithmic number of projections for non-strongly convex optimization. We also demonstrate their effectiveness for solving compressive sensing and distance metric learning problems."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "The issue of high projection cost in projected gradient descent has received increasing attention in recent years. Most studies are based on the Frank-Wolfe technique that eschews the projection in favor of a linear optimization over the constrained domain (Jaggi, 2013; Hazan & Kale, 2012; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2013; Garber & Hazan, 2015). It happens that for many bounded domains (e.g., bounded\n1where O\u0303() suppresses a logarithmic factor. 2where the constraint function is assumed to be smooth.\nballs for vectors and matrices, a PSD constraint with a bounded trace norm) the linear optimization over the constrained domain is much cheaper than projection into the constrained domain (Jaggi, 2013). However, there still exist many constraints that render both projection into the constrained domain and linear optimization under the constraint are comparably expensive. Examples include polyhedral constraints, quadratic constraints and a PSD constraint 3.\nTo tackle these complex constraints, the idea of optimization with a reduced number of projections was explored in several studies since (Mahdavi et al., 2012). In a recent paper (Chen et al., 2016), the authors show that for stochastic strongly convex optimization, the optimal convergence rate can be achieved using a logarithmic number of projections. In contrast, the developed theory in this paper implies that only one projection is sufficient to achieve the optimal convergence rate for strongly convex optimization, and a logarithmic number of projections can be used to accelerate convergence rates for non-strongly convex optimization. Cotter et al. (2016) proposed a stochastic algorithm for solving heavily constrained problems with many constraint functions by extending the work of (Mahdavi et al., 2012). Nonetheless, their focus is not to improve the convergence rates. Zhang et al. (2013) studied the smooth and strongly convex optimization and they proposed a stochastic algorithm withO(\u03ba log(T )) projections and proved anO(1/T ) convergence rate, where \u03ba is the condition number and T is the total number of iterations. Nonetheless, if the condition number is high the number of projections could be very large. In addition, their algorithm utilizes the minibatch to avoid frequent projections in stochastic optimization, which is different from the present paper.\nWe note that several recent works also exploit different forms of error bound conditions to improve the convergence (Wang & Lin, 2014; So, 2013; Hou et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015; Yang & Lin, 2016; Xu et al., 2016). Most notably, the technique used in our work is closely related to (Yang & Lin, 2016). However, for constrained optimization problems the methods in (Yang & Lin, 2016) still need to conduct projections at each iteration.\nFinally, we comment on the differences between the proposed methods and the classical penalty methods that also move the constraint into the objective using a penalty function (Bertsekas, 1996). The major differences are that (i) the classical penalty methods typically require solving each subproblem exactly while our methods do not require that; and (ii) the classical penalty methods typically guarantee asymptotic convergence while our methods have explicit convergence rates.\n3Indeed, a linear optimization over a PSD constraint is illposed because the PSD domain is unbounded."}, {"heading": "3. Preliminaries", "text": "Let \u2126 = {x \u2208 Rd : c(x) \u2264 0} denote the constrained domain, \u2126\u2217 denote the optimal solution set and f\u2217 denote the optimal objective value. We denote by \u2207f(x) the gradient and by \u2202f(x) the subgradient of a smooth or non-smooth function, respectively. When f(x) is a non-smooth function, we consider the problem as non-smooth constrained optimization. When both f(x) and c(x) are smooth, we consider the problem as smooth constrained optimization. A function f(x) is L-smooth if it has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, i.e., \u2016\u2207f(x)\u2212\u2207f(y)\u2016 \u2264 L\u2016x\u2212 y\u2016, where \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 denotes the Euclidean norm.

Let [s]+ be a hinge operator that is defined as [s]+ = s if s \u2265 0, and [s]+ = 0 if s < 0.\nThroughout the paper, we make the the following assumptions to facilitate the development of our algorithms and theory.\nAssumption 1. For a convex minimization problem (1), we assume (i) there exists a positive value \u03c1 > 0 such that\nmin c(x)=0\nv\u2208\u2202c(x),v 6=0\n\u2016v\u2016 \u2265 \u03c1, (2)\nor more generally there exists a constant \u03c1 > 0 for any x \u2208 Rd, such that x\\ = arg minu\u2208Rd,c(u)\u22640 \u2016u \u2212 x\u20162 satisfies\n\u2016x\\ \u2212 x\u2016 \u2264 [c(x)]+/\u03c1. (3)\n(ii) there exists a strictly feasible solution such that c(x) < 0; (iii) both f(x) and c(x) are defined everywhere and are Lipschitz continuous with their Lipschitz constants denoted by G and Gc, respectively. We make several remarks about the assumptions. The inequality in (2) is introduced in (Mahdavi et al., 2012), which is to ensure the distance from the final solution before projection to constrained domain \u2126 is not too large. Note that the inequality in (3) is a more general condition than (2) as seen from the following lemma.\nLemma 1. For any x \u2208 Rd, let x\\ = arg minc(u)\u22640 \u2016u\u2212 x\u20162. If (2) holds, then (3) holds.\nThe above lemma is implicit in the proof of (Mahdavi et al., 2012). We will provide more discussions about Assumption 1(i) - the key assumption, and exhibit the value of \u03c1 for a number of commonly seen constraints (e.g., polyhedral, quadratic and PSD constraints). To make the presentation more fluent, we postpone these discussions to Section 6. The strict feasibility assumption (ii) allows us to explore the KKT condition of the projection problem shown below.\nAssumption (iii) imposes mild Lipschitz continuity conditions on both f(x) and c(x).\nTraditional projected gradient descent methods need to solve the following projection at each iteration \u03a0\u2126[x] = arg minc(u)\u22640 \u2016u \u2212 x\u20162.

For many constraint functions (see Section 6), solving the projection problem and the linear optimization could be very expensive."}, {"heading": "4. A General Theory of Optimization with only one projection", "text": "In this section, we extend the idea of only one projection proposed in (Mahdavi et al., 2012) to a general theory, and then present optimization algorithms with only one projection for non-smooth and smooth optimization, respectively. To tackle the constraint, we introduce a penalty function h\u03b3(x) parameterized by \u03b3, which obeys the following certificate: there exist constants C \u2265 0 and \u03bb > G/\u03c1 such that\nh\u03b3(x) \u2265 \u03bb[c(x)]+,\u2200x h\u03b3(x) \u2264 C\u03b3, \u2200x such that c(x) \u2264 0.\n(4)\nFrom the above condition, it is clear that \u03b3 \u2265 0. It is notable that the penalty function h\u03b3(x) will also depend on \u03bb; however it will be set to a constant value, thus the dependence on \u03bb is omitted. We will construct such a penalty function h\u03b3(x) for non-smooth and smooth optimization in next two subsections. We propose to optimize the following augmented objective function\nmin x\u2208Rd F\u03b3(x) = f(x) + h\u03b3(x). (5)\nWe can employ any applicable optimization algorithms to optimize F\u03b3(x) pretending that there is no constraint, and finally obtain a solution x\u0302T that is not necessarily feasible. In order to obtain a feasible solution, we perform one projection to get x\u0303T = \u03a0\u2126(x\u0302T ). The following theorem allows us to convert the convergence of x\u0302T for F\u03b3(x) to that of x\u0303T for f(x).\nTheorem 1.

The notationBT (\u03b3;x,x1) emphasizes that it is a function of \u03b3 and depends on x1 and a target solution x and it will be referred to as BT . In the next several subsections, we will see that by carefully choosing the penalty function h\u03b3(x) we are able to provide nice convergence for smooth and non-smooth optimization with only one projection. In the above theorem, we assume the optimization algorithm A is deterministic. However, a similar result can be easily extended to a stochastic optimization algorithm A.\nProof. First, we consider c(x\u0302T ) \u2264 0, which implies that x\u0302T = x\u0303T . Due to the certificate of h\u03b3(x), F\u03b3(x\u0303T ) \u2265 f(x\u0303T ) and F\u03b3(x\u2217) \u2264 f(x\u2217) + C\u03b3. Hence f(x\u0303T ) \u2264 F\u03b3(x\u0302T ) \u2264 F\u03b3(x\u2217) + BT (\u03b3;x1,x\u2217) \u2264 f(x\u2217) + C\u03b3 + BT (\u03b3;x1,x\u2217). Then (7) follows due to \u03bb\u03c1/(\u03bb\u03c1\u2212G) \u2265 1. Next, we assume c(x\u0302T ) > 0.

For a convex minimization problem (1), we assume (i) there exist x0 \u2208 \u2126 and 0 \u2265 0 such that f(x0)\u2212 minx\u2208\u2126 f(x) \u2264 0; (ii) \u2126\u2217 is a non-empty convex compact set; (iii) the optimization problem (1) satisfies a local error bound condition, i.e., there exist \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1] and \u03c3 > 0 such that for any x \u2208 S we have dist(x,\u2126\u2217) \u2264 \u03c3(f(x) \u2212 f\u2217)\n\u03b8 where \u2126\u2217 denotes the optimal set and f\u2217 denotes the optimal value. Remark: we would like to remark that the new assumption only imposes mild conditions on the problem. In particular, Assumption 2 (i) supposes there is a lower bound of the optimal value f\u2217, which usually holds in machine learning applications where the objective function if non-negative; Assumption 2 (ii) ensures that S is also bounded (Rockafellar, 1970), therefore the \u03c3 in the local error bound is finite, which can be easily satisfied for a norm regularized or constraint problems; the local error bound condition holds for a broad family of functions (e.g., semi-algebraic functions or real subanalytic functions (Jerome Bolte, 2015; Yang & Lin, 2016)). In Section 7, we will also demonstrate several applications of the improved algorithms proposed in this section by establishing the local error bound condition.\nAlthough the local error bound condition is much weaker than the strong convexity assumption, below we will propose novel algorithms leveraging this condition with faster convergence and only a logarithmic number of projections."}, {"heading": "5.1.

Discussion of Assumption 1 (i)", "text": "One might note that a key condition for developing the theory with reduced projections is Assumption 1 (i). Although Mahdavi et al. (2012) has briefly mentioned that the condition can be satisfied for a PSD cone or a Polytope (a bounded polyhedron), their discussion lacks of details in particular on the value of \u03c1 in (2) or (3). Below, we discuss the condition in details about three types of constraints.\nPolyhedral constraints. First, we show that when c(x) is a polyhedral function, i.e., its epigraph is a polyhedron (not necessarily bounded), the inequality (3) is satisfied. To this end, we explore the polyhedral error bound (PEB) condition (Gilpin et al., 2012; Yang & Lin, 2016). In particular, if we consider an optimization problem, minx\u2208Rd h(x), where the epigraph of h(x) is polyhedron. Let H\u2217 denote the optimal set and h\u2217 denote the optimal value of the problem above. The PEB says that there exists \u03c1 > 0 such that for any x \u2208 Rd\ndist(x,H\u2217) \u2264 (h(x)\u2212 h\u2217)/\u03c1. (13)\nTo show that the inequality (3) holds for a polyhedral function c(\u00b7), we can consider the optimization problem minx\u2208Rd [c(x)]+. The optimal set of the above problem is given by H\u2217 = {x \u2208 Rd : c(x) \u2264 0}. For any x such that c(x) > 0, let x\\ = arg minc(u)\u22640 \u2016u \u2212 x\u20162 be the closest point in the optimal set to x. Therefore if c(\u00b7) is a polyhedral function so does [c(x)]+, by the PEB condition (13) there exists a \u03c1 > 0 such that \u2016x \u2212 x\\\u2016 \u2264 ([c(x)]+ \u2212 minx[c(x)]+)/\u03c1 = [c(x)]+/\u03c1. Let us consider a concrete example, where the problem has a set of affine inequalities c>i x \u2212 bi \u2264 0, i = 1, . . . ,m. There are two methods to encode this into a single constraint function c(x) \u2264 0. The first method is to use c(x) = max1\u2264i\u2264m c > i x \u2212 bi, which is a polyhedral function and therefore satisfies (3). The second method is to use c(x) = \u2016[Cx \u2212 b]+\u2016, where [a]+ = max(0,a) and C = (c1, . . . , cm)\n>. Thus [c(x)]+ = \u2016[Cx \u2212 b]+\u2016. The inequality (3) is then guaranteed by Hoffman\u2019s bound and the parameter \u03c1 is given by the minimum non-zero eigenvalue of C>C (Wang & Lin, 2014). Note that the projection onto a polyhedron is a linear constrained quadratic programming problem, and the linear optimization over a polyhedron is a linear programming problem. Both have polynomial time complexity that would be high if m and d are large (Karmarkar, 1984; Kozlov et al., 1980).\nQuadratic constraint. A quadratic constraint can take the form of \u2016Ax \u2212 y\u20162 \u2264 \u03c4 , where A \u2208 Rm\u00d7d and y \u2208 Rm. Such a constraint appears in compressive sensing (Cande\u0300s & Wakin, 2008)5, where the goal is to reconstruct a sparse high-dimensional vector x from a small number of noisy measurements y = Ax + \u03b5 \u2208 Rm with m d. The corresponding optimization problem is\nminx\u2208Rd \u2016x\u20161, s.t. \u2016Ax\u2212 y\u20162 \u2264 \u03c4. (14)\nwhere \u03c4 \u2265 \u2016\u03b5\u20162 is an upper bound on the magnitude of the noise. To check the Assumption 1(i), we note that c(x) = \u2016Ax\u2212y\u20162\u2212\u03c4 and\u2207c(x) = A>(Ax\u2212y). Let us consider that A has a full row rank 6 and denote by v = Ax \u2212 y, then on the boundary c(x) = 0 we have \u2016v\u2016 = \u221a \u03c4 and\n\u2016A>v\u2016 \u2265 \u221a \u03c4\u03bbmin(AA>), where \u03bbmin(AA>) > 0 is the minimum eigenvalue of AA> \u2208 Rm\u00d7m. Therefore the Assumption 1(i) is satisfied with \u03c1 = \u221a \u03c4\u03bbmin(AA>). It is notable that the projection and the linear optimization under the quadratic constraint require solving a quadratic programming problem and therefore could be expensive.\nPSD constraint. A PSD constraintX 0 forX \u2208 Rd\u00d7d can be written as an inequality constraint \u2212\u03bbmin(X) \u2264 0, where \u03bbmin(X) denotes the minimum eigen-value of X . The subgradient of c(X) = \u2212\u03bbmin(X) when \u03bbmin(X) = 0 is given by Conv{\u2212uu>|\u2016u\u2016 = 1, Xu = 0}, i.e., the convex hull of the outer products of normalized vectors in the null space of the matrix X . In (Yang et al., 2017), we show that if the dimension of the null space of X is r with 1 \u2264 r \u2264 d, the norm of the subgradient of c(X) on the boundary c(X) = 0 is lower bounded by \u03c1 = 1\u221a\nr \u2265 1\u221a d .\nFinally, we note that computing a subgradient of [c(X)]+ only needs to compute one eigen-vector corresponding to the smallest eigen-value. In contrast, both projection and linear optimization under a PSD constraint could be very expensive for high-dimensional problems. In particular, the projection onto a PSD domain needs to conduct a singular value decomposition. The linear optimization over a PSD cone is ill-posed due to that PSD cone is not compact (the solution is either 0 or infinity). One may add an artificial constraint on the upper bound of the eigen-values. According to (Jaggi, 2013), the time complexity for solving this linear optimization problem approximately up to an accuracy level \u2032 is O(Nd1.5/ \u20322.5) with N being the number of non-zeros in the gradient and \u2032 decreasing iteratively required in the Frank-Wolfe method, which could be much more expensive especially for high-dimensional problems and in later iterations than computing the first eigen-pairs at each iteration in our methods.\n5Here we use the square constraint to make it a smooth function so that the proposed algorithms for smooth optimization are applicable by using proximal gradient mapping to handle the `1 norm.\n6which is reasonable because m d."}, {"heading": "7. Applications", "text": ""}, {"heading": "7.1. Compressive Sensing", "text": "We first consider a compressive sensing problem in (14). Becker et al. (2011) proposed an optimization algorithm based on the Nesterov\u2019s smoothing and the Nesterov\u2019s optimal method for the smoothed problem, known as NESTA. It needs to perform the projection into the domain \u2016Ax \u2212 y\u20162 \u2264 \u03c4 at every iteration and has an iteration complexity of O(1/ ). In contrast, the presented algorithm with only one projection in Section 4.2 using Nesterov\u2019s accelerated proximal gradient method (Beck & Teboulle, 2009) to solve the unconstrained problem enjoys an iteration complexity ofO(1/ ). Moreover, we present a theorem below showing that the problem (14) satisfies the local error bound condition with \u03b8 = 1/2, and hence the presented LoPNAG enjoys an O\u0303(1/ \u221a ) iteration complexity with only a logarithmic number of projections.\nTheorem 6. Let f(x) = \u2016x\u20161, c(x) = \u2016Ax \u2212 y\u20162 \u2212 \u03c4 , \u2126\u2217 denote the optimal set and f\u2217 be the optimal solution to (14). Assume that there exists x0 such that \u2016Ax0\u2212y\u20162 < \u03c4 and 0 6\u2208 \u2126\u2217. Then for any > 0, x \u2208 Rd such that c(x) \u2264 0 and f(x) \u2264 f\u2217 + , there exists 0 < \u03c3 < \u221e such that dist(x,\u2126\u2217) \u2264 \u03c3(f(x) \u2212 f\u2217)1/2. Hence, LoPNAG can have an iteration complexity of O\u0303(1/ \u221a ) with only O(log(1/ )) projections.\nNext, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the LoPNAG for solving the compressive sensing problem in (14) by comparing with NESTA. We generate a synthetic data for testing. In particular, we generate a random measurement matrix A \u2208 Rm\u00d7d with m = 1000 and d = 5000. The entries of the matrix A are generated independently with the uniform distribution over the interval [\u22121,+1]. The vector x\u2217 \u2208 Rd is generated with the same distribution at 100 randomly chosen coordinates. The noise \u03b5 \u2208 Rm is a dense vector with independent random entries with the uniform distribution over the interval [\u2212\u03b6, \u03b6], where \u03b6 is the noise magnitude and is set to 0.01. Finally the vector y was obtained as y = Ax\u2217 + \u03b5.\nWe use the Matlab package of NESTA 7. For fair comparison, we also use the projection code in the NESTA package for conducting projection. To handle the unknown smoothness parameter in the proposed algorithm, we use the backtracking technique (Beck & Teboulle, 2009). The parameter \u03b3 is initially set to 0.001 and decreased by half every 5000 iterations after a projection and the target smoothing parameter in NESTA is set to 10\u22125. For the value of \u03bb in LoPNAG, we tune it from its theoretical value to several smaller values and choose the one that yields the fastest convergence. We report the results in Table 7.1, which include different number of iterations, the corresponding\n7http://statweb.stanford.edu/\u02dccandes/ nesta/\nnumber of projections, the recovery error of the found solution compared to the underlying true sparse solution, the objective value (i.e., the `1 norm of the found solution) and the running time. Note that each iteration of NESTA requires two projections because it maintains two extra sequence of solutions. From the results, we can see that LoPNAG converges significantly faster than NESTA. Even with only one projection, we are able to obtain a better solution than that of NESTA after running 10000 iterations."}, {"heading": "7.2.

We note that such a formulation is useful for high dimensional problems due to the `1 regularizer. A similar formulation with different forms of loss function has been adopted in literature (Qi et al., 2009). We consider the square loss because it gives us faster convergence with a logarithmic number of projections by LoPGD. Due to the presence of the non-smooth PSD constraint and the `1 regularizer, Nesterov\u2019s accelerated proximal gradient methods can not be applied efficiently to solving (15) and the augmented unconstrained problem. Nevertheless, we can apply the proposed LoPGD method for solving the problem with a logarithmic number of projections. Regarding the constant \u03b8 in the local error bound condition for (15), it still remains an open problem. Nonetheless, a local error bound condition with \u03b8 = 0.5 might be established under certain regularity condition of the problem (Zhou & So, 2015; Cui et al., 2017). For example, Cui et al. (2017) provided a direct analysis of a local error bound condition with \u03b8 = 0.5 for a class of constrained convex symmetric matrix optimization problems\nregularized by nonsmooth spectral functions (including the indicator function of a PSD constraint). They established sufficient conditions (Theorem 16) for a local error bound condition with \u03b8 = 0.5 to hold, which reduces to a regularity condition for (15) depending on the optimal solutions of the problem. A thorough analysis of the regularity condition is much more involved and left as an open problem.\nNext, we demonstrate the empirical performance of LoPGD for solving (15). We use the colon-cancer data available on libsvm web portal, which has 2000 features and 62 examples. Fourty examples are used as training examples to generate 780 pairs to learn the distance metric. The regularization parameter is set to \u03c4 = 0.001. We compare LoPGD, gradient descent method with only one projection (referred to as OPGD), and standard projected GD (referred to PGD). The step size in PGD and OPGD is set to \u03b70/ \u221a t, where t is the iteration index. We use the same tuned initial step size for all algorithms. The number of iterations per-epoch in LoPGD is set to 1000. The penalization parameter \u03bb in both OPGD and LoPGD is tuned and set to 10. In Table 2, we report the objective values, the #of iterations/projections, and running time across the first 8000 iterations. We can see that LoPGD converges dramatically faster than PGD and also much faster than OPGD."}, {"heading": "8.

In particular, we aim at challenging problems for which both projection into the constrained domain and a linear optimization under the inequality constraint are time-consuming, which render both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a.k.a. the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection reduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization with improved convergence rates under a certain regularity condition of the constraint function. We first present a general theory of optimization with only one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one projection yields O(1/ ) iteration complexity, which improves over the O(1/ ) iteration complexity established before for nonsmooth optimization and can be further reduced under strong convexity. Then we introduce a local error bound condition and develop faster algorithms for non-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of projections. In particular, we achieve an iteration complexity of \u00d5(1/ 2(1\u2212\u03b8)) for non-smooth optimization and \u00d5(1/ 1\u2212\u03b8) for smooth optimization, where \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1] appearing the local error bound condition characterizes the functional local growth rate around the optimal solutions. Novel applications in solving the constrained `1 minimization problem and a positive semi-definite constrained distance metric learning problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant speed-up compared with previous algorithms.
