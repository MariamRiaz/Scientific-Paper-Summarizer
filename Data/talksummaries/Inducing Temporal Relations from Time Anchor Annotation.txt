24	33	First, as long as time anchors of all mentions in a document are given, our pre-defined rules can induce the temporal relations for all the quadratic pairs.
27	14	Third, the automatic generation rules can provide flexible relation types based on our definition and this increased informativeness might contribute positively to downstream tasks.
45	20	The majority of the temporal relation classifiers focus on exploiting a variety of features to improve the performance in TimeBank.
68	13	In temporal information retrieval, Berberich et al. (2010) proposed a four-tuple representation (‘earliest begin’, ‘latest begin’, ‘earliest end’, ‘latest end’) for uncertain time expression (e.g. ‘1990s’) in order to integrate such temporal information into language model.
77	20	Annotat- ing time anchors of individual mentions extremely reduces annotation effort, as it is linear with mention numbers.
107	47	Our new TORDERs are formally similar to the conventional TLINKs, as both state a temporal relation between two mentions.
108	16	BEFORE and AFTER represent that one mention occurs before or after in a timeline, which is close to before and after.
112	19	VAGUE and PVAGUE state that our generation rules cannot induce the relations, similar to vague (i.e. annotators cannot judge the relations).
116	19	But in the one-day granularity, the relation is shifted to SAME DAY.
121	30	However, we can easily obtain SAME DAY relations, since their day-level time anchors are the same.
130	20	TLINKs can capture the temporal ordering information between events, when time expressions are often absent in the documents such as novels and narratives.
146	19	That is the reason why we need a downstream task (i.e. Time Anchors Prediction in Section 5) to measure how much temporal order information is encoded in TORDERs and TLINKs.
147	16	The shift of TLINK relations to SAME DAY due to the one-day minimal granularity setting can also be clearly observed.
154	24	Although the different definition of TORDERs from TLINKs makes direct comparison difficult, the more balanced distribution of TORDERs can possibly provide more informative classification results to benefit the downstream tasks.
157	18	The classification system achieves fairly high F1 0.631 in Event-DCT and 0.485 in Event-Time on the SAME DAY temporal orders, which are the main information source to predict the precise time of events.
162	16	In this section, we describe a two-step system trained with the existing TLINKs and our data to challenge a downstream time anchor prediction task.
164	25	Predicting the time of events from the news articles is an attractive goal, which is a necessary step towards automatic event timeline extraction.
174	27	The first-step temporal order classifier is designed to provide the temporal relations of the mention pairs in a document.
175	16	The second-step selects the most precise time by taking all Event-Time and Event-DCT relations of a target event as input.
178	13	When the system is trained with the TORDERs, we slightly modified the algorithm by replacing the TLINK relations with similar TORDER relations.
184	15	Table 5 summarizes the main results of the twostep time anchor prediction system trained with TORDER and TLINK data.
186	16	‘Event-DCT’ or ‘EventTime’ denotes the second-step selection takes only Event-DCT or Event-Time pairs as input, which helps us to investigate how much information is provided by the different types of pairs for predicting the final time anchors.
196	40	In this section, we perform an additional experiment to make a comparison to a system with the first-step replaced by a state-of-the-art dense TLINK classifier CAEVO (Chambers et al., 2014).
208	19	The main limitation of TORDER is that events are required to be anchored in a timeline.
209	60	Strötgen and Gertz (2016) introduce the highly different characteristics of time expressions in four domains of text.
210	41	It suggests that our proposal is difficult to be applied in some domains.
211	42	One possible solution is to adopt a hybrid annotation method to annotate a target event towards the most relevant event (TLINK-style), when temporal information is absent in its context.
212	23	Although this work is motivated for contributing to timeline applications, evaluating this proposal in the temporal question answering is also valuable.
213	88	SAME DAY could be harmful because this task possibly requires to know the exact order between two events occurring on the same day.
214	40	It is worth conceiving a more general solution to improve the limitations of TORDER in the future work.
