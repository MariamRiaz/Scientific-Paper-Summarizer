The following theorem shows that this dependence is tight.\nTheorem 1.2. Let any integer k \u2265 3 be given. There exists a function f : R \u2192 R computed by a ReLU network with 2k layers, each with \u2264 2 nodes, such that any rational function g : R \u2192 R with \u2264 2k\u22122 total terms in the numerator and denominator must satisfy\u222b\n[0,1]\n|f(x)\u2212 g(x)|dx \u2265 1 64 .\nNote that this statement implies the desired difficulty of approximation, since a gap in the above integral (L1) distance implies a gap in the earlier uniform distance (L\u221e), and furthermore an r-degree rational function necessarily has \u2264 2r + 2 total terms in its numerator and denominator.\nAs a final piece of the story, note that the conversion between rational functions and ReLU networks is more seamless if instead one converts to rational networks, meaning neural networks where each activation function is a rational function.\nLemma 1.3. Let a ReLU network f : [\u22121,+1]d \u2192 R be given as in Theorem 1.1, meaning f has at most l layers and each node computes z 7\u2192 \u03c3r(a>z+b) where where the pair (a, b) (possibly distinct across nodes) satisfies \u2016a\u20161 + |b| \u2264 1. Then there exists a rational function R of degree O(ln(l/ )2) so that replacing each \u03c3r in f with R yields a function g : [\u22121,+1]d \u2192 R with\nsup x\u2208[\u22121,+1]d\n|f(x)\u2212 g(x)| \u2264 .\nCombining Theorem 1.2 and Lemma 1.3 yields an intriguing corollary.\nCorollary 1.4. For every k \u2265 3, there exists a function f : R \u2192 R computed by a rational network with O(k) layers andO(k) total nodes, each node invoking a rational activation of degreeO(k), such that every rational function g : R\u2192 R with less than 2k\u22122 total terms in the numerator and denominator satisfies\u222b\n[0,1]\n|f(x)\u2212 g(x)|dx \u2265 1 128 .\nThe hard-to-approximate function f is a rational network which has a description of size O(k2). Despite this, attempting to approximate it with a rational function of the usual form requires a description of size \u2126(2k). Said another way: even for rational functions, there is a benefit to a neural network representation!"}, {"heading": "1.2. Auxiliary results", "text": "The first thing to stress is that Theorem 1.1 is impossible with polynomials: namely, while it is true that ReLU networks can efficiently approximate polynomials (Yarotsky, 2016; Safran & Shamir, 2016; Liang & Srikant, 2017), on the other hand polynomials require degree \u2126(poly(1/ )), rather than O(poly(ln(1/ ))), to approximate a single ReLU, or equivalently the absolute value function (Petrushev & Popov, 1987, Chapter 4, Page 73).\nAnother point of interest is the depth needed when converting a rational function to a ReLU network. Theorem 1.1 is impossible if the depth is o(ln(1/ )): specifically, it is impossible to approximate the degree 1 rational function x 7\u2192 1/x with size O(ln(1/ )) but depth o(ln(1/ )). Proposition 1.5. Set f(x) := 1/x, the reciprocal map.

The ability to compute switch statements appears to be a fairly foundational operation available to neural networks and rational functions (Petrushev & Popov, 1987, Theorem 5.2), but is not available to polynomials (since otherwise they could approximate the ReLU)."}, {"heading": "1.3. Related work", "text": "The results of the present work follow a long line of work on the representation power of neural networks and related functions. The ability of ReLU networks to fit continuous functions was no doubt proved many times, but it appears the earliest reference is to Lebesgue (Newman, 1964, Page 1), though of course results of this type are usu-\nally given much more contemporary attribution (Cybenko, 1989). More recently, it has been shown that certain function classes only admit succinct representations with many layers (Telgarsky, 2015). This has been followed by proofs showing the possibility for a depth 3 function to require exponentially many nodes when rewritten with 2 layers (Eldan & Shamir, 2016). There are also a variety of other result giving the ability of ReLU networks to approximate various function classes (Cohen et al., 2016; Poggio et al., 2017).\nMost recently, a variety of works pointed out neural networks can approximate polynomials, and thus smooth functions essentially by Taylor\u2019s theorem (Yarotsky, 2016; Safran & Shamir, 2016; Liang & Srikant, 2017). This somewhat motivates this present work, since polynomials can not in turn approximate neural networks with a dependence O(poly log(1/ )): they require degree \u2126(1/ ) even for a single ReLU.\nRational functions are extensively studied in the classical approximation theory literature (Lorentz et al., 1996; Petrushev & Popov, 1987). This literature draws close connections between rational functions and splines (piecewise polynomial functions), a connection which has been used in the machine learning literature to draw further connections to neural networks (Williamson & Bartlett, 1991). It is in this approximation theory literature that one can find the following astonishing fact: not only is it possible to approximate the absolute value function (and thus the ReLU) over [\u22121,+1] to accuracy > 0 with a rational function of degreeO(ln(1/ )2) (Newman, 1964), but moreover the optimal rate is known (Petrushev & Popov, 1987; Zolotarev, 1877)! These results form the basis of those results here which show that rational functions can approximate ReLU networks. (Approximation theory results also provide other functions (and types of neural networks) which rational functions can approximate well, but the present work will stick to the ReLU for simplicity.)\nAn ICML reviewer revealed prior work which was embarrassingly overlooked by the author: it has been known, since decades ago (Beame et al., 1986), that neural networks using threshold nonlinearities (i.e., the map x 7\u2192 1[x \u2265 0]) can approximate division, and moreover the proof is similar to the proof of part 1 of Theorem 1.1! Moreover, other work on threshold networks invoked Newman polynomials to prove lower bound about linear threshold networks (Paturi & Saks, 1994). Together this suggests that not only the connections between rational functions and neural networks are tight (and somewhat known/unsurprising), but also that threshold networks and ReLU networks have perhaps more similarities than what is suggested by the differing VC dimension bounds, approximation results, and algorithmic results (Goel et al., 2017)."}, {"heading": "1.4. Further notation", "text": "Here is a brief description of the sorts of neural networks used in this work. Neural networks represent computation as a directed graph, where nodes consume the outputs of their parents, apply a computation to them, and pass the resulting value onward. In the present work, nodes take their parents\u2019 outputs z and compute \u03c3r(a>z + b), where a is a vector, b is a scalar, and \u03c3r(x) := max{0, x}; another popular choice of nonlineary is the sigmoid x 7\u2192 (1 + exp(\u2212x))\u22121. The graphs in the present work are acyclic and connected with a single node lacking children designated as the univariate output, but the literature contains many variations on all of these choices.\nAs stated previously, a rational function f : Rd \u2192 R is ratio of two polynomials. Following conventions in the approximation theory literature (Lorentz et al., 1996), the denominator polynomial will always be strictly positive. The degree of a rational function is the maximum of the degrees of its numerator and denominator."}, {"heading": "2.

This in turn gives a way to approximate the ReLU, since\n\u03c3r(x) = max{0, x} = x+ |x|\n2 .

Typical polynomials in approximation theory, for instance the Chebyshev polynomials, have very active oscillations; in comparison, the Newman polynomials look a little funny, lying close to 0 over [\u22121, 0], and quickly increasing monotonically over [0, 1]. The seminal result of Newman (1964) is that\nsup |x|\u22641 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223|x| \u2212 x ( Nr(x)\u2212Nr(\u2212x) Nr(x) +Nr(\u2212x) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 3 exp(\u2212\u221ar)/2.

Let R(x) denote a rational approximation to \u03c3r. Fix a layer i + 1, and let H(x) denote the multi-valued mapping computed by layer i, and let HR(x) denote the mapping obtained by replacing each \u03c3r in H with R.

The first step, via Lemma 1.3, is to replace each \u03c3r with a rational functionR of low degree (this last bit using Newman polynomials). The second step is to inductively collapse the network into a single rational function. The reason for the dependence on the number of nodes m is that, unlike polynomials, summing rational functions involves an increase in degree:\np1(x) q1(x) + p1(x) q2(x) = p1(x)q2(x) + p2(x)q1(x) q1(x)q2(x) ."}, {"heading": "2.4.

The function \u2206k will cross this line 2k times. Now consider a rational function f(x) = p(x)/q(x). The set of points where f(x) = 1/2 corresponds to points where 2p(x)\u2212q(x) = 0.\nA poor estimate for the number of zeros is simply the degree of 2p\u2212q, however, since f is univariate, a stronger tool becomes available: by Descartes\u2019 rule of signs, the number of zeros in f \u2212 1/2 is upper bounded by the number of terms in 2p\u2212 q."}, {"heading": "3.

The starting point is the following approximation of the squaring function. Lemma 3.1 ((Yarotsky, 2016)). Let any > 0 be given. There exists f : x \u2192 [0, 1], represented as a ReLU network with O(ln(1/ )) nodes and layers, such that supx\u2208[0,1] |f(x)\u2212 x2| \u2264 and f(0) = 0.\nYarotsky\u2019s proof is beautiful and deserves mention. The approximation of x2 is the function fk, defined as\nfk(x) := x\u2212 k\u2211 i=1 \u2206i(x) 4i ,\nwhere \u2206 is the triangle map from Section 2. For every k, fk is a convex, piecewise-affine interpolation between points along the graph of x2; going from k to k + 1 does not adjust any of these interpolation points, but adds a new set of O(2k) interpolation points.\nOnce squaring is in place, multiplication comes via the polarization identity xy = ((x+ y)2 \u2212 x2 \u2212 y2)/2. Lemma 3.2 ((Yarotsky, 2016)). Let any > 0 and B \u2265 1 be given. There exists g(x, y) : [0, B]2 \u2192 [0, B2], represented by a ReLU network with O(ln(B/ ) nodes and layers, with\nsup x,y\u2208[0,1]\n|g(x, y)\u2212 xy| \u2264\nand g(x, y) = 0 if x = 0 or y = 0.\nNext, it follows that ReLU networks can efficiently approximate exponentiation thanks to repeated squaring. Lemma 3.3. Let \u2208 (0, 1] and positive integer y be given. There exists h : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1], represented by a ReLU network with O(ln(y/ )2) nodes and layers, with\nsup x,y\u2208[0,1]\n\u2223\u2223h(x)\u2212 xy\u2223\u2223 \u2264\nWith multiplication and exponentiation, a representation result for polynomials follows.\nLemma 3.4. Let \u2208 (0, 1] be given. Let p : [0, 1]d \u2192 [\u22121,+1] denote a polynomial with \u2264 s monomials, each with degree \u2264 r and scalar coefficient within [\u22121,+1]. Then there exists a function q : [0, 1]d \u2192 [\u22121,+1] computed by a network of size O ( min{sr ln(sr/ ), sd ln(dsr/ )2} ) , which satisfies supx\u2208[0,1]d |p(x)\u2212 q(x)| \u2264 .\nThe remainder of the proof now focuses on the division operation. Since multiplication has been handled, it suffices to compute a single reciprocal.\nLemma 3.5. Let \u2208 (0, 1] and nonnegative integer k be given. There exists a ReLU network q : [2\u2212k, 1] \u2192 [1, 2k], of sizeO(k2 ln(1/ )2) and depthO(k4 ln(1/ )3) such that\nsup x\u2208[2\u2212k,1] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223q(x)\u2212 1x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 .\nThis proof relies on two tricks. The first is to observe, for x \u2208 (0, 1], that\n1 x =\n1 1\u2212 (1\u2212 x) = \u2211 i\u22650 (1\u2212 x)i.\nThanks to the earlier development of exponentiation, truncating this summation gives an expression easily approximate by a neural network as follows.\nLemma 3.6. Let 0 < a \u2264 b and > 0 be given. Then there exists a ReLU network q : R \u2192 R with O(ln(1/(a ))2) layers and O((b/a) ln(1/(a ))3) nodes satisfying\nsup x\u2208[a,b] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223q(x)\u2212 1x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2 .\nUnfortunately, Lemma 3.6 differs from the desired statement Lemma 3.6: inverting inputs lying within [2\u2212k, 1] requires O(2k ln(1/ )2) nodes rather than O(k4 ln(1/ )3)!\nTo obtain a good estimate with only O(ln(1/ )) terms of the summation, it is necessary for the input to be x bounded below by a positive constant (not depending on k). This leads to the second trick (which was also used by Beame et al. (1986)!).\nConsider, for positive constant c > 0, the expression\n1 x =\nc\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 cx) = c \u2211 i\u22650 (1\u2212 cx)i.\nIf x is small, choosing a larger c will cause this summation to converge more quickly. Thus, to compute 1/x accurately over a wide range of inputs, the solution here is to multiplex approximations of the truncated sum for many choices of c. In order to only rely on the value of one of them, it is possible to encode a large \u201cswitch\u201d style statement in a neural network. Notably, rational functions can also representat switch statements (Petrushev & Popov, 1987, Theorem 5.2), however polynomials can not (otherwise they could approximate the ReLU more efficiently, seeing as it is a switch statement of 0 (a degree 0 polynomial) and x (a degree 1 polynomial).

ReLU networks have two hidden layers each with 3 nodes. This is not exactly apples to apples (e.g., the rational function has twice as many parameters as the polynomial), but still reasonable as most of the approximation literature fixes polynomial and rational degrees in comparisons.\nFigure 1 shows the ability of all three classes to approximate a truncated reciprocal. Both rational functions and ReLU networks have the ability to form \u201cswitch statements\u201d that let them approximate different functions on different intervals with low complexity (Petrushev & Popov, 1987, Theorem 5.2). Polynomials lack this ability; they can not even approximate the ReLU well, despite it being low degree polynomials on two separate intervals.\nFigure 2 shows that rational functions can fit the threshold function errily well; the particular rational function used here is based on using Newman polynomials to approximate (1 + |x|/x)/2 (Newman, 1964).\nFigure 3 shows Newman polynomialsN5,N9,N13.

In more detail, it is shown here that for any ReLU network, there exists a rational function of degreeO(poly log(1/ )) which is -close, and similarly for any rational function there exists a ReLU network of size O(poly log(1/ )) which is -close. By contrast, polynomials need degree \u03a9(poly(1/ )) to approximate even a single ReLU. When converting a ReLU network to a rational function as above, the hidden constants depend exponentially on the number of layers, which is shown to be tight; in other words, a compositional representation can be beneficial even for rational functions.", "title": "Neural Networks and Rational Functions"}
