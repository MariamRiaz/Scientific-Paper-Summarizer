Entering a new group is rarely easy.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Adjusting to unfamiliar behavioral norms and donning a new identity can be cognitively and emotionally taxing, and failure to do so can lead to exclusion.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But successful enculturation to the group often yields significant rewards, especially in organizational contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Fitting in has been tied to positive career outcomes such as faster time-to-promotion, higher performance ratings, and reduced risk of being fired (O’Reilly et al., 1991; Goldberg et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A major challenge for enculturation research is distinguishing between internalization and self-
regulation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Internalization, a more inwardly focused process, involves identifying as a group member and accepting group norms, while selfregulation, a more outwardly oriented process, entails deciphering the group’s normative code and adjusting one’s behavior to comply with it.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing approaches, which generally rely on selfreports, are subject to various forms of reporting bias and typically yield only static snapshots of this process.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent computational approaches that use language as a behavioral signature of group integration uncover dynamic traces of enculturation but cannot distinguish between internalization and self-regulation.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To overcome these limitations, we introduce a dynamic measure of directed linguistic accommodation between a newcomer and existing group members.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our approach differentiates between an individual’s (1) base rate of word use and (2) linguistic alignment to interlocutors.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The former corresponds to internalization of the group’s linguistic norms, whereas the latter reflects the capacity to regulate one’s language in response to peers’ language use.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We apply this language model to a corpus of internal email communications and personnel records, spanning a seven-year period, from a mid-sized technology firm.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that changes in base rates and alignment, especially with respect to pronoun use, are consistent with successful assimilation into a group and can predict eventual employment outcomes— continued employment, involuntary exit, or voluntary exit—at levels above chance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We use this predictive problem to investigate the nature of linguistic alignment.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our results suggest that the common formulation of alignment as a lexical-level phenomenon is incomplete.

Linguistic alignment Linguistic alignment is the tendency to use the same or similar words as one’s conversational partner.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Alignment is an instance of a widespread and socially important human behavior: communication accommodation, the tendency of two interacting people to nonconsciously adopt similar behaviors.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Evidence of accommodation appears in many behavioral dimensions, including gestures, postures, speech rate, self-disclosure, and language or dialect choice (see Giles et al. (1991) for a review).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"More accommodating people are rated by their interlocutors as more intelligible, attractive, and cooperative (Feldman, 1968; Ireland et al., 2011; Triandis, 1960).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"These perceptions have material consequences—for example, high accommodation requests are more likely to be fulfilled, and pairs who accommodate more in how they express uncertainty perform better in lab-based tasks (Buller and Aune, 1988; Fusaroli et al., 2012).
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Although accommodation is ubiquitous, individuals vary in their levels of accommodation in ways that are socially informative.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Notably, more powerful people are accommodated more strongly in many settings, including trials (Gnisci, 2005), online forums (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012), and Twitter (Doyle et al., 2016).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Most relevant for this work, speakers may increase their accommodation to signal camaraderie or decrease it to differentiate from the group.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For example, Bourhis and Giles (1977) found that Welsh English speakers increased their use of the Welsh accent and language in response to an English speaker who dismissed it.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
Person-group fit and linguistic alignment These findings suggest that linguistic alignment is a useful avenue for studying how people assimilate into a group.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Whereas traditional approaches to studying person-group fit rely on self-reports that are subject to various forms of reporting bias and cannot feasibly be collected with high granularity across many points in time, recent studies have proposed language-based measures as a means to tracing the dynamics of person-group fit without having to rely on self-reports.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Building on Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013)’s research into language use similarities as a proxy for social distance between individuals, Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) and Goldberg et al. (2016) devel-
oped a measure of cultural fit based on the similarity in linguistic style between individuals and their colleagues in an organization.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Their timevarying measure highlights linguistic compatibility as an important facet of cultural fit and reveals distinct trajectories of enculturation for employees with different career outcomes.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While this approach can help uncover the dynamics and consequences of an individual’s fit with her colleagues in an organization, it cannot disentangle the underlying reasons for this alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For two primary reasons, it cannot distinguish between fit that arises from internalization and fit produced by self-regulation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"First, Goldberg et al. (2016) and Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) define fit using a symmetric measure, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which does not take into account the direction of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
Yet the distinction between an individual adapting to peers versus peers adapting to the individual would appear to be consequential.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Second, this prior work considers fit across a wide range of linguistic categories but does not interrogate the role of particular categories, such as pronouns, that can be especially informative about enculturation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For example, a person’s base rate use of the first-person singular (I) or plural (we) might indicate the degree of group identity internalization, whereas adjustment to we usage in response to others’ use of the pronoun might reveal the degree of self-regulation to the group’s normative expectations.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Modeling fit with WHAM To address these limitations, we build upon and extend the WHAM alignment framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016) to analyze the dynamics of internalization and selfregulation using the complete corpus of email communications and personnel records from a mid-sized technology company over a seven-year period.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM uses a conditional measure of alignment, separating overall homophily (unconditional similarity in people’s language use, driven by internalized similarity) from in-the-moment adaptation (adjusting to another’s usage, corresponding to self-regulation).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM also provides a directed measure of alignment, in that it estimates a replier’s adaptation to the other conversational participant separately from the participant’s adaptation to the replier.
Level(s) of alignment The convention within linguistic alignment research, dating back to early
work on Linguistic Style Matching (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002), is to look at lexical alignment: the repetition of the same or similar words across conversation participants.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"From a communication accommodation standpoint, this is justified by assuming that one’s choice of words represents a stylistic signal that is partially independent of the meaning one intends to express—similar to the accommodation on paralinguistic signals discussed above.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"The success of previous linguistic alignment research shows that this is valid.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"However, words are difficult to divorce from their meanings, and sometimes repeating a word conflicts with repeating its referent.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"In particular, pronouns often refer to different people depending on who uses the pronoun.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While there is evidence that one person using a first-person singular pronoun increases the likelihood that her conversation partner will as well (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007), we may also expect that one person using first-person singular pronouns may cause the other to use more second-person pronouns, so that both people are referring to the same person.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"This is especially important under the Interactive Alignment Model view (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), where conversants align their entire mental representations, which predicts both lexical and referential alignment behaviors will be observed.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Discourse-strategic explanations for alignment also predict alignment at multiple levels (Doyle and Frank, 2016).
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Since we have access to a high-quality corpus with meaningful outcome measures, we can investigate the relative importance of these two types of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We will show that referential alignment is more predictive of employment outcomes than is lexical alignment, suggesting a need for alignment research to consider both levels rather than just the latter.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We use the complete corpus of internal emails exchanged among full-time employees at a midsized US-based technology company between 2009 to 2014 (Srivastava et al., forthcoming).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
Each email was summarized as a count of word categories in its text.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"These categories are a subset of the Linguistic Information and Word Count system (Pennebaker et al., 2007).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"The categories were chosen because they are likely to be indica-
tive of one’s standing/role within a group.1
We divided email chains into message-reply pairs to investigate conditional alignment between a message and its reply.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To limit these pairs to cases where the reply was likely related to the preceding message, we removed all emails with more than one sender or recipient (including CC/BCC), identical sender and recipient, or where the sender or recipient was an automatic notification system or any other mailbox that was not specific to a single employee.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"We also excluded emails with no body text or more than 500 words in the body text, and pairs with more than a week’s latency between message and reply.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Finally, because our analyses involve enculturation dynamics over the first six months of employment, we excluded replies sent by an employee whose overall tenure was less than six months.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"This resulted in a collection of 407,779 messagereply pairs, with 485 distinct replying employees.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
We combined this with monthly updates of employees joining and leaving the company and whether they left voluntarily or involuntarily.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Of the 485, 66 left voluntarily, 90 left involuntarily, and 329 remained employed at the end of the observation period.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
Privacy protections and ethical considerations Research based on employees’ archived electronic communications in organizational settings poses potential threats to employee privacy and company confidentiality.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To address these concerns, and following established ethical guidelines for the conduct of such research (Borgatti and Molina, 2003), we implemented the following procedures: (a) raw data were stored on secure research servers behind the company’s firewall; (b) messages exchanged with individuals outside the firm were eliminated; (c) all identifying information such as email addresses was transformed into hashed identifiers, with the company retaining access to the key code linking identifying information to hashed identifiers; and (d) raw message content was transformed into linguistic categories so that identities could not be inferred from message content.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Per terms of the non-disclosure agreement we signed with the firm, we are not able to share the data underlying the analyses reported below.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"1Six pronoun categories (first singular (I), first plural (we), second (you), third singular personal (he, she), third singular impersonal (it, this), and third plural (they)) and five time/certainty categories (past tense, present tense, future tense, certainty, and tentativity).
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"We can, however, share the code and dummy test data, both of which can be accessed at http: //github.com/gabedoyle/acl2017.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To assess alignment, we use the Word-Based Hierarchical Alignment Model (WHAM) framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The core principle of WHAM is that alignment is a change, usually an increase, in the frequency of using a word category in a reply when the word category was used in the preceding message.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For instance, a reply to the message What will we discuss at the meeting?, is likely to have more instances of future tense than a reply to the message What did we discuss at the meeting?",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Under this definition, alignment is the log-odds shift from the baseline reply frequency, the frequency of the word in a reply when the preceding message did not contain the word.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"WHAM is a hierarchical generative modeling framework, so it uses information from related observations (e.g., multiple repliers with similar demographics) to improve its robustness on sparse data (Doyle et al., 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"There are two key parameters, shown in Figure 2: ηbase, the log-odds of a given word category c when the preceding message did not contain c, and ηalign, the increase in the log-odds of c when the preceding message did contain c.
A dynamic extension To understand enculturation, we need to track changes in both the alignment and baseline over time.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"We add a month-bymonth change term to WHAM, yielding a piecewise linear model of these factors over the course of an employee’s tenure.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Each employee’s tenure is broken into two or three segments: their first six months after being hired, their last six months before leaving (if they leave), and the rest of their tenure.2 The linear segments for their alignment are fit as an intercept term ηalign, based at their first month (for the initial period) or their last month (for the final period), and per-month slopes α.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Baseline segments are fit similarly, with parameters ηbase and β.3",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To visualize the align-
2Within each segment, the employee’s alignment model is similar to that of Yurovsky et al. (2016), who introduced a constant by-month slope parameter to model changes in parent-child alignment during early linguistic development.
3The six month timeframe was chosen as previous research has found it to be a critical period for early enculturation (Bauer et al., 1998).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Pilot investigations into the change
ment behaviors and the parameter values, we create “sawhorse” plots, with an example in Figure 1.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In our present work, we are focused on changes in cultural fit during the transitions into or out of the group, so we collapse observations outside the first/last six months into a stable point estimate, constraining their slopes to be zero.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This simplification also circumvents the issue of different employees having different middle-period lengths.4
Model structure The graphical model for our instantiation of WHAM is shown in Figure 2.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For each word category c, WHAM’s generative model represents each reply as a series of tokenby-token independent draws from a binomial distribution.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The binomial probability µ is dependent on whether the preceding message did (µalign) or did not (µbase) contain a word from category c, and the inferred alignment value is the difference between these probabilities in log-odds space (ηalign).
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The specific values of these variables depend on three hierarchical features: the word category c, the group g that a given employee falls into, and the time period t (a piece of the piece-wise
in baseline usage over time showed roughly linear changes over the first/last six months, but our linearity assumption may mask interesting variation in the enculturation trajectories.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"4As shown in Figure 1, the pieces do not need to define a continuous function.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Alignment behaviors continue to change in the middle of an employee’s tenure (Srivastava et al., forthcoming), so alignment six months in to the job is unlikely to be equal to alignment six months from leaving, or the average alignment over the middle tenure.
linear function: beginning, middle, or end).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Note that the hierarchical ordering is different for the η chains and the α/β chains; c is above g and t for the η chains, but below them for the α/β chains.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This is because we expect the static (η) values for a given word category to be relatively consistent across different groups and at different times, but we expect the values to be independent across the different word categories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Conversely, we expect that the enculturation trajectories across word categories (α/β) will be similar, while the trajectories may vary substantially across different groups and different times.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Lastly, the month m in which a reply is written (measured from the start of the time period t) has a linear effect on the η value, as described below.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To estimate alignment, we first divide the replies up by group, time period, and calendar month.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We separate the replies into two sets based on whether the preceding message contained the category c (the “alignment” set) or not (the “baseline” set).,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All replies within a set are then aggregated in a single bag-of-words representation, with category token counts Calignc,g,t,m and C base c,g,t,m, and total token counts N basec,g,t,m and N base c,g,t,m comprising the observed variables on the far right of the model.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Moving from right to left, these counts are assumed to come from binomial draws with prob-
ability µalignc,g,t,m or µ base c,g,t,m. The µ values are then in turn generated from η values in log-odds space by an inverse-logit transform, similar to linear predictors in logistic regression.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The ηbase variables are representations of the baseline frequency of a marker in log-odds space, and µbase is simply a conversion of ηbase to probability space, the equivalent of an intercept term in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"ηalign is an additive value, with µalign = logit−1(ηbase + ηalign), the equivalent of a binary feature coefficient in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The specific month’s η variables are calculated as a linear function: ηalignc,g,t,m = η align c,g,t +",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"mαc,g,t, and similarly with β for the baseline.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The remainder of the model is a hierarchy of normal distributions that integrate social structure into the analysis.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In the present work, we have three levels in the hierarchy: category, group, and time period.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In Analysis 1, employees are grouped by their employment outcome (stay, leave voluntarily, leave involuntarily); in Analyses 2 & 3, where we predict the employment outcomes, each group is a single employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The normal distributions that connect these levels have identical standard deviations σ2 = .25.5,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The hierarchies
5The deviation is not a theoretically motivated choice, and was chosen as a good empirical balance between reasonable parameter convergence (improved by smaller σ2) and good model log-probability (improved by larger σ2).
are headed by a normal distribution centered at 0, except for the ηbase hierarchy, which has a Cauchy(0, 2.5) distribution.6
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
Message and reply length can affect alignment estimates; the WHAM model was developed in part to reduce this effect.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"As different employees had different email length distributions, we further accounted for length by dividing all replies into five quintile length bins, and treated each bin as separate observations for each employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This design choice adds an additional control factor, but results were qualitatively similar without it.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All of our analyses are based on parameter estimates from RStan fits of WHAM with 500 iterations over four chains.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"While previous research on cultural fit has emphasized either its internalization (O’Reilly et al., 1991) or self-regulation (Goldberg et al., 2016) components, our extension to the WHAM framework helps disentangle them by estimating them as separate baseline and alignment trajectories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For example, we can distinguish between an archetypal individual who initially aligns to her colleagues and then internalizes this style of communication such that her baseline use also shifts and another archetypal person who aligns to her colleagues but does not change her baseline usage.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The former exhibits high correspondence between internalization and self-regulation, whereas the latter demonstrates an ability to decouple them.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We perform three analyses on this data.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"First, we examine the qualitative behaviors of pronoun alignment and how they map onto employee outcomes in the data.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Second, we show that these qualitative differences in early enculturation are meaningful, with alignment behaviors predicting employment outcome above chance.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we consider lexical versus referential levels of alignment and show that predictions are improved under the referential formulation, suggesting that alignment is not limited to low-level wordrepetition effects.
",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"6As ηbase is the log-odds of each word in a reply being a part of the category c, it is expected to be substantially negative.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"For example, second person pronouns (you), are around 2% of the words in replies, approximately −4 in log-odds space.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
We follow Gelman et al. (2008)’s recommendation of the Cauchy prior as appropriate for parameter estimation in logistic regression.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"We begin with descriptive analyses of the behavior of pronouns, which are likely to reflect incorporation into the company.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"In particular, we look at first-person singular (I), first-person plural (we), and second-person pronouns (you).",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"We expect that increases in we usage will occur as the employee is integrated into the group, while I and you usage will decrease, and want to understand whether these changes manifest on baseline usage (i.e., internalization), alignment (i.e., self-regulation), or both.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Design We divided each employee’s emails by calendar month, and separated them into the employee’s first six months, their last six months (if an employee left the company within the observation period), and the middle of their tenure.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees with fewer than twelve months at the company were excluded from this analysis, so that their first and last months did not overlap.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
We fit two WHAM models in this analysis.,5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The first aggregated all employees, regardless of employment outcome, to minimize noise; the second separated them by outcome to analyze cultural fit differences.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Outcome-aggregated model We start with the aggregated behavior of all employees, shown in Figure 3.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"For baselines, we see decreased use of I
and you over the first six months, with we usage increasing over the same period, confirming the expected result that incorporating into the group is accompanied by more inclusive pronoun usage.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Despite the baseline changes, alignment is fairly stable through the first six months.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Alignment on first-person singular and second-person pronouns is lower than first-person plural pronouns, likely due to the fact that I or you have different referents when used by the two conversants, while both conversants could use we to refer to the same group.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
We will consider this referential alignment in more detail in Analysis 3.,5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Since employees with different outcomes have much different experiences over their last six months, we will not discuss them in aggregate, aside from noting the sharp decline in we alignment near the end of the employees’ tenures.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Outcome-separated model Figure 4 shows outcome-specific trajectories, with green lines showing involuntary leavers (i.e., those who are fired or downsized), blue showing voluntary leavers, and orange showing employees who remained at the company through the final month of the data.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The use of I and you is similar to the aggregates in Figure 3, regardless of group.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The last six months of I usage show an interesting difference, where involuntary leavers align more on I but retain a stable baseline while voluntary leavers retain a stable alignment but increase I overall, which is consistent with group separation.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The most compelling result we see here, though, is the changes in we usage by different groups of employees.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees who eventually leave the
company involuntarily show signs of more selfregulation than internalization over the first six months, increasing their alignment while decreasing their baseline use (though they return to more similar levels as other employees later in their tenure).",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees who stay at the company, as well as those who later leave voluntarily, show signs of internalization, increasing their baseline usage to the company average, as well as adapting their alignment levels to the mean.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"This finding suggests that how quickly the employees internalize culturally-standard language use predicts their eventual employment outcome, even if they eventually end up near the average.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"This analysis tests the hypothesis that there are meaningful differences in employees’ initial enculturation, captured by alignment behaviors.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
We examine the first six months of communications and attempt to predict whether the employee will leave the company.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We find that, even with a simple classifier, alignment behaviors are predictive of employment outcome.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
Design We fit the WHAM model to only the first six months of email correspondence for all employees who had at least six months of email.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"The model estimated the initial level of baseline use (ηbase) and alignment (ηalign) for each employee, as well as the slope (α, β) for baseline and alignment over those first six months, over all 11 word categories mentioned in Section 3.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We then created logistic regression classifiers, using the parameter estimates to predict whether an employee would leave the company.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
We fit separate classifiers for leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our results show that early alignment behaviors are better at identifying employees who will leave involuntarily than voluntarily, consistent with Srivastava et al.’s (forthcoming) findings that voluntary leavers are similar to stayers until late in their tenure.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We fit separate classifiers using the alignment parameters and the baseline parameters to investigate their relative informativity.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"For each model, we report the area under the curve (AUC).",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This value is estimated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate over different classification thresholds.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
An AUC of 0.5 represents chance performance.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We use balanced, stratified cross-
validation to reduce AUC misestimation due to unbalanced outcome frequencies and high noise (Parker et al., 2007).
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Results The left column of Figure 5 shows the results over 10 runs of 10-fold balanced logistic classifiers with stratified cross-validation in R. The alignment-based classifiers are both above chance at predicting that an employee will leave the company, whether involuntarily or voluntarily.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"The baseline-based classifiers perform worse, especially on voluntary leavers.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This finding is consistent with the idea that voluntary leavers resemble stayers (who form the bulk of the employees) until late in their tenure when their cultural fit declines.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We fit a model using both alignment and baseline parameters, but this model yielded an AUC value below the alignment-only classifier.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This suggests that where alignment and baseline behaviors are both predictive, they do not provide substantially different predictive power and lead to overfitting.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
A more sophisticated classifier may overcome these challenges; our goal here was not to achieve maximal classification performance but to test whether alignment provided any useful information about employment outcomes.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our final analysis investigates the nature of linguistic alignment: specifically, whether there is an effect of referential alignment beyond that of the more commonly used lexical alignment.
",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
Testing this hypothesis requires a small change to the alignment calculations.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"Lexical alignment is based on the conditional probability of the replier using a word category c given that the preceding message used that same category c. For referential alignment, we examine the conditional probability of the replier using a word category cj given that the preceding message used the category ci, where ci and cj are likely to be referentially linked.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]

"The pairs of categories that are likely to be referentially or transitionally linked are: (you, I); (we, I); (you, we); (past, present); (present, future); and (certainty, tentativity).",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]

Results Figure 5 plots the differences in predictive model performance using lexical versus referential alignment parameters.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
We find that the semantic parameters provide more accurate classification than the lexical both for voluntarily and involuntarily-leaving employees.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"This suggests that while previous work looking at lexical alignment successfully captures social structure, referential alignment may reflect a deeper and more accurate representation of the social structure.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"It is unclear if this behavior holds in less formal situations or with weaker organizational structure and shared goals, but these results suggest that the traditional alignment approach of only measuring lexical alignment should be augmented with referential alignment measures for a more complete analysis.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"A key finding from this work is that pronoun usage behaviors in employees’ email communication are consistent with social integration into the group; employees use “I” pronouns less and
“we” pronouns more as they integrate.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we see the importance of using an alignment measure such as WHAM for distinguishing the base rate and alignment usage of words.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Employees who leave the company involuntarily show increased “we” usage through greater alignment, using “we” more when prompted by a colleague, but introducing it less of their own accord.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This suggests that these employees do not feel fully integrated into the group, although they are willing to identify as a part of it when a more fully-integrated group member includes them, corresponding to self-regularization over internalization.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The fact that these alignment measures alone, without any job productivity or performance metrics, have some predictive capability for employees’ leaving the company suggests the potential for support or intervention programs to help highperforming but poorly-integrated employees integrate into the company better.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"More generally, the prominence of pronominally-driven communication changes suggest that alignment analyses can provide insight into a range of social integration settings.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This may be especially helpful in cases where there is great pressure to integrate smoothly, and people would be likely to adopt a self-regulating approach even if they do not internalize their group membership.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Such settings not only include the high-stakes situation of keeping one’s job, but of transitioning from high school to college or moving to a new country or region.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Maximizing the chances for new members to become comfortable within a group is critical both for spreading useful aspects of the group’s existing culture to new members and for integrating new ideas from the new members’ knowledge and practices.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Alignment-based approaches can be a useful tool in separating effective interventions that cause internalization of the group dynamics from those that lead to more superficial self-regularization changes.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
This paper described an effort to use directed linguistic alignment as a measure of cultural fit within an organization.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We adapted a hierarchical alignment model from previous work to estimate fit within corporate email communications, focusing on changes in language during employees’ entry to and exit from the company.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Our results
showed substantial changes in the use of pronouns, with pronoun patterns varying by employees’ outcomes within the company.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
The use of the firstperson plural “we” during an employee’s first six months is particularly instructive.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Whereas stayers exhibited increased baseline use, indicating internalization, those eventually departing involuntarily were on the one hand decreasingly likely to introduce “we” into conversation, but increasingly responsive to interlocutors’ use of the pronoun.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"While not internalizing a shared identity with their peers, involuntarily departed employees were overly self-regulating in response to its invocation by others.
",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Quantitatively, rates of usage and alignment in the first six months of employment carried information about whether employees left involuntarily, pointing towards fit within the company culture early on as an indicator of eventual employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Finally, we saw ways in which the application of alignment to cultural fit might help to refine ideas about alignment itself: preliminary analysis suggested that referential, rather than lexical, alignment was more predictive of employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"More broadly, these results suggest ways that quantitative methods can be used to make precise application of concepts like “cultural fit” at scale.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]

Cultural fit is widely believed to affect the success of individuals and the groups to which they belong.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"Yet it remains an elusive, poorly measured construct.",abstractText,[0],[0]
Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"By contrast, we develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic alignment, which estimates the influence of one person’s word use on another’s and distinguishes between two enculturation mechanisms: internalization and selfregulation.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We use this measure to trace employees’ enculturation trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of individuals downstream outcomes, especially involuntary exit.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"In instruction-following tasks, an agent executes a sequence of actions in a real or simulated environment, in response to a sequence of natural language commands.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Examples include giving navigational directions to robots and providing hints to automated game-playing agents.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Plans specified with natural language exhibit compositionality both at the level of individual actions and at the overall sequence level.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper describes a framework for learning to follow instructions by leveraging structure at both levels.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our primary contribution is a new, alignmentbased approach to grounded compositional semantics.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Building on related logical approaches (Reddy et al., 2014; Pourdamghani et al., 2014), we recast instruction following as a pair of nested, structured alignment problems.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given instructions and a candidate plan, the model infers a sequenceto-sequence alignment between sentences and
atomic actions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Within each sentence–action pair, the model infers a structure-to-structure alignment between the syntax of the sentence and a graphbased representation of the action.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"At a high level, our agent is a block-structured, graph-valued conditional random field, with alignment potentials to relate instructions to actions and transition potentials to encode the environment model (Figure 3).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Explicitly modeling sequenceto-sequence alignments between text and actions allows flexible reasoning about action sequences, enabling the agent to determine which actions are specified (perhaps redundantly) by text, and which actions must be performed automatically (in order to satisfy pragmatic constraints on interpretation).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Treating instruction following as a sequence prediction problem, rather than a series of independent decisions (Branavan et al., 2009; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013), makes it possible to use general-purpose planning machinery, greatly increasing inferential power.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The fragment of semantics necessary to complete most instruction-following tasks is essentially predicate–argument structure, with limited influence from quantification and scoping.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Thus the problem of sentence interpretation can reasonably be modeled as one of finding an alignment between language and the environment it describes.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We allow this structure-to-structure alignment— an “overlay” of language onto the world—to be mediated by linguistic structure (in the form of dependency parses) and structured perception (in what we term grounding graphs).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model thereby reasons directly about the relationship between language and observations of the environment, without the need for an intermediate logical representation of sentence meaning.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This, in turn, makes it possible to incorporate flexible feature representations that have been difficult to integrate with previous work in semantic parsing.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We apply our approach to three established

instruction-following benchmarks: the map reading task of Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), the maze navigation task of MacMahon et al. (2006), and the puzzle solving task of Branavan et al. (2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
An example from each is shown in Figure 1.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These benchmarks exhibit a range of qualitative properties—both in the length and complexity of their plans, and in the quantity and quality of accompanying language.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each task has been studied in isolation, but we are unaware of any published approaches capable of robustly handling all three.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our general model outperforms strong, task-specific baselines in each case, achieving relative error reductions of 15–20% over several state-of-the-art results.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

We have released all code for this project at github.com/jacobandreas/instructions.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing work on instruction following can be roughly divided into two families: semantic parsers and linear policy estimators.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Semantic parsers Parser-based approaches (Chen and Mooney, 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013; Kim and Mooney, 2013) map from text into a formal language representing commands.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"These take familiar structured prediction models for semantic parsing (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006), and train them with task-provided supervision.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Instead of attempting to match the structure of a manually-annotated semantic parse, semantic parsers for instruction following are trained to maximize a reward signal
provided by black-box execution of the predicted command in the environment.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"(It is possible to think of response-based learning for question answering (Liang et al., 2013) as a special case.)
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"This approach uses a well-studied mechanism for compositional interpretation of language, but is subject to certain limitations.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Because the environment is manipulated only through black-box execution of the completed semantic parse, there is no way to incorporate current or future environment state into the scoring function.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
It is also in general necessary to hand-engineer a task-specific formal language for describing agent behavior.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Thus it is extremely difficult to work with environments that cannot be modeled with a fixed inventory of predicates (e.g. those involving novel strings or arbitrary real quantities).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Much of contemporary work in this family is evaluated on the maze navigation task introduced by MacMahon et al. (2006).,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Dukes (2013) also introduced a “blocks world” task for situated parsing of spatial robot commands.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Linear policy estimators An alternative family of approaches is based on learning a policy over primitive actions directly (Branavan et al., 2009; Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010).1 Policybased approaches instantiate a Markov decision process representing the action domain, and apply standard supervised or reinforcement-learning approaches to learn a function for greedily selecting among actions.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In linear policy approximators, natural language instructions are incorporated directly into state observations, and reading order
1This is distinct from semantic parsers in which greedy inference happens to have an interpretation as a policy (Vlachos and Clark, 2014).
becomes part of the action selection process.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Almost all existing policy-learning approaches make use of an unstructured parameterization, with a single (flat) feature vector representing all text and observations.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Such approaches are thus restricted to problems that are simple enough (and have small enough action spaces) to be effectively characterized in this fashion.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"While there is a great deal of flexibility in the choice of feature function (which is free to inspect the current and future state of the environment, the whole instruction sequence, etc.), standard linear policy estimators have no way to model compositionality in language or actions.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Agents in this family have been evaluated on a variety of tasks, including map reading (Anderson et al., 1991) and gameplay (Branavan et al., 2009).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Though both families address the same class of instruction-following problems, they have been applied to a totally disjoint set of tasks.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"It should be emphasized that there is nothing inherent to policy learning that prevents the use of compositional structure, and nothing inherent to general compositional models that prevents more complicated dependence on environment state.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Indeed, previous work (Branavan et al., 2011; Narasimhan et al., 2015) uses aspects of both to solve a different class of gameplay problems.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In some sense, our goal in this paper is simply to combine the strengths of semantic parsers and linear policy estimators for fully general instruction following.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"As we shall see, however, this requires changes to many aspects of representation, learning and inference.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
We wish to train a model capable of following commands in a simulated environment.,3 Representations,[0],[0]

Our model performs compositional interpretation of instructions by leveraging existing structure inherent in both text and actions.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Thus we interpret xi and yj not as raw strings and primitive actions, but rather as structured objects.

"Linguistic structure We assume access to a pretrained parser, and in particular that each of the instructions xi is represented by a tree-structured dependency parse.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example is shown in Figure 2b.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Action structure By analogy to the representation of instructions as parse trees, we assume that each (state, action, state) triple (provided by the environment model) can be characterized by a grounding graph.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
The structure and content of this representation is task-specific.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example grounding graph for the maze navigation task is
shown in Figure 2d.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"The example contains a node corresponding to the primitive action move(2) (in the upper left), and several nodes corresponding to locations in the environment that are visible after the action is performed.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Each node in the graph (and, though not depicted, each edge) is decorated with a list of features.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"These features might be simple indicators (e.g. whether the primitive action performed was move or rotate), real values (the distance traveled) or even string-valued (English-language names of visible landmarks, if available in the environment description).",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Formally, a grounding graph consists of a tuple (V,E,L, fV , fE), with
– V a set of vertices
– E ∈ V × V a set of (directed) edges – L a space of labels (numbers, strings, etc.) – fV : V → 2L a vertex feature function – fE : E → 2L an edge feature function In this paper we have tried to remain agnostic to details of graph construction.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
Our goal with the grounding graph framework is simply to accommodate a wider range of modeling decisions than allowed by existing formalisms.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Graphs might be constructed directly, given access to a structured virtual environment (as in all experiments in this paper), or alternatively from outputs of a perceptual system.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"For our experiments, we have remained as close as possible to task representations described in the existing literature.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Details for each task can be found in the accompanying software package.

"Graph-based representations are extremely common in formal semantics (Jones et al., 2012; Reddy et al., 2014), and the version presented here corresponds to a simple generalization of familiar formal methods.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Indeed, if L is the set of all atomic entities and relations, fV returns a unique label for every v ∈ V , and fE always returns a vector with one active feature, we recover the existentially-quantified portion of first order logic exactly, and in this form can implement large parts of classical neo-Davidsonian semantics (Parsons, 1990) using grounding graphs.

"Crucially, with an appropriate choice of L this formalism also makes it possible to go beyond settheoretic relations, and incorporate string-valued features (like names of entities and landmarks) and real-valued features (like colors and positions) as well.

Lexical semantics We must eventually combine features provided by parse trees with features provided by the environment.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Examples here might include simple conjunctions (word=yellow ∧ rgb=(0.5, 0.5, 0.0)) or more complicated computations like edit distance between landmark names and lexical items.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Features of the latter kind make it possible to behave correctly in environments containing novel strings or other features unseen during training.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"This aspect of the syntax–semantics interface has been troublesome for some logic-based approaches: while past work has used related machinery for selecting lexicon entries (Berant and Liang, 2014) or for rewriting logical forms (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), the relationship between text and the environment has ultimately been mediated by a discrete (and indeed finite) inventory of predicates.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Several recent papers have investigated simple grounded models with realvalued output spaces (Andreas and Klein, 2014; McMahan and Stone, 2015), but we are unaware of any fully compositional system in recent literature that can incorporate observations of these kinds.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Formally, we assume access to a joining feature function φ : (2L × 2L)→ Rd.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"As with grounding graphs, our goal is to make the general framework as flexible as possible, and for individual experiments have chosen φ to emulate modeling decisions from previous work.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"As noted in the introduction, we approach instruction following as a sequence prediction problem.",4 Model,[0],[0]
Thus we must place a distribution over sequences of actions conditioned on instructions.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"We decompose the problem into two components, describing interlocking models of “path structure” and “action structure”.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Path structure captures how sequences of instructions give rise to sequences of actions, while action structure captures the compositional relationship between individual utterances and the actions they specify.

"Path structure: aligning utterances to actions
The high-level path structure in the model is depicted in Figure 3.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Our goal here is to permit both under- and over-specification of plans, and to expose a planning framework which allows plans to be computed with lookahead (i.e. non-greedily).
",4 Model,[0],[0]
These goals are achieved by introducing a sequence of latent alignments between instructions and actions.,4 Model,[0],[0]
Consider the multi-step example in Figure 1b.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"If the first instruction go down the yellow hall were interpreted immediately, we would have a presupposition failure—the agent is facing a wall, and cannot move forward at all.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Thus an implicit rotate action, unspecified by text, must be performed before any explicit instructions can be followed.

"To model this, we take the probability of a (text, plan, alignment) triple to be log-proportional to the sum of two quantities:

We additionally place a monotonicity constraint on the alignment variables.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"This model is globally normalized, and for a fixed alignment is equivalent to a linear-chain CRF.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"In this sense it is analogous to IBM Model I (Brown et al., 1993), with the structured potentials ψ(xi, yj) taking the place of lexical translation probabilities.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"While alignment models from machine translation have previously been used to align words to fragments of semantic parses (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Pourdamghani et al., 2014), we are unaware of such models being used to align entire instruction sequences to demonstrations.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Action structure: aligning words to percepts Intuitively, this scoring function ψ(x, y) should capture how well a given utterance describes an action.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"If neither the utterances nor the actions had structure (i.e. both could be represented with simple bags of features), we would recover something analogous to the conventional policy-learning approach.",4 Model,[0],[0]

"Our choice of ψ(x, y) is driven by the following fundamental assumptions: Syntactic relations approximately represent semantic relations.",4 Model,[0],[0]
Syntactic proximity implies relational proximity.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"In this view, there is an additional hidden structure-tostructure alignment between the grounding graph and the parsed text describing it.",4 Model,[0],[0]

3It is formally possible to regard the sequence-tosequence and structure-to-structure alignments as a single (structured) random variable.,4 Model,[0],[0]

"Here we simply allow all words to license all predicates, multiple words to specify the same predicate, and some edges to be skipped.",4 Model,[0],[0]

For the moment let us introduce variables b to denote these structure-to-structure alignments.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"(As will be seen in the following section, it is straightforward to marginalize over all choices of b.",4 Model,[0],[0]

Let c(i) and c(j) give the indices of the dependents of xi and children of yj respectively.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"Finally, let xik and yjl denote the associated dependency type or relation.",4 Model,[0],[0]

"Meanwhile, maximization of a can be performed exactly using the Viterbi algorithm, without computation of normalizers.

Inference at test time involves a slightly different pair of optimization problems.,5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"We again perform iterated conditional modes, here on the alignments a and the unknown output path y.

"As one of the main advantages of this approach is its generality, we evaluate on several different benchmark tasks for instruction following.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
These exhibit great diversity in both environment structure and language use.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
We compare our full system to recent state-of-the-art approaches to each task.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In the introduction, we highlighted two core aspects of our approach to semantics: compositionality (by way of grounding graphs and structure-to-structure alignments) and planning (by way of inference with lookahead and sequence-to-sequence alignments).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To evaluate these, we additionally present a pair of ablation experiments: no grounding graphs (an agent with an unstructured representation of environment state), and no planning (a reflex agent with no lookahead).

"Map reading Our first application is the map navigation task established by Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), based on data collected for a psychological experiment by Anderson et al. (1991) (Figure 1a).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Each training datum consists of a map with a designated starting position, and a collection of landmarks, each labeled with a spatial coordinate and a string name.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Names are not always unique, and landmarks in the test set are never observed during training.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This map is accompanied by a set of instructions specifying a path from the starting position to some (unlabeled) destination point.,6 Evaluation,[1.0],['This map is accompanied by a set of instructions specifying a path from the starting position to some (unlabeled) destination point.']
"These instruction sets are informal and redundant, involving as many as a hundred utterances.",6 Evaluation,[1.0],"['These instruction sets are informal and redundant, involving as many as a hundred utterances.']"
"They are transcribed from spoken text, so grammatical errors, disfluencies, etc. are common.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This is a
prime example of a domain that does not lend itself to logical representation—grammars may be too rigid, and previously-unseen landmarks and real-valued positions are handled more easily with feature machinery than predicate logic.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The map task was previously studied by Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), who implemented SARSA with a simple set of features.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"By combining these features with our alignment model and search procedure, we achieve state-of-the-art results on this task by a substantial margin (Table 1).

Some learned feature values are shown in Table 2.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The model correctly infers cardinal directions (the example shows the preferred side of a destination landmark modified by the word top).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Like Vogel et al., we see support for both allocentric references (you are on top of the hill) and egocentric references (the hill is on top of you).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We can also see pragmatics at work: the model learns useful text-independent constraints—in this case, that near destinations should be preferred to far ones.

Maze navigation The next application we consider is the maze navigation task of MacMahon et al. (2006) (Figure 1b).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, a virtual agent is sit-
uated in a maze (whose hallways are distinguished with various wallpapers, carpets, and the presence of a small set of standard objects), and again given instructions for getting from one point to another.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This task has been the subject of focused attention in semantic parsing for several years, resulting in a variety of sophisticated approaches.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Despite superficial similarity to the previous navigation task, the language and plans required for this task are quite different.",6 Evaluation,[1.0],"['Despite superficial similarity to the previous navigation task, the language and plans required for this task are quite different.']"

"We also outperform both variants of our system, most conspicuously the variant without grounding graphs.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This highlights the importance of compositional structure.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Recent work by Kim and Mooney (2013) and Artzi et al. (2014) has achieved better results; these systems make use of techniques and resources (respectively, discriminative reranking and a seed lexicon of handannotated logical forms) that are largely orthogonal to the ones used here, and might be applied to improve our own results as well.

Puzzle solving The last task we consider is the Crossblock task studied by Branavan et al. (2009) (Figure 1c).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, again, natural language is used to specify a sequence of actions, in this case the solution to a simple game.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The environment is simple enough to be captured with a flat feature

",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Unlike the other tasks we consider, Crossblock is distinguished by a challenging associated search problem.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Here it is nontrivial to find any sequence that eliminates all the blocks (the goal of the puzzle).,6 Evaluation,[1.0],['Here it is nontrivial to find any sequence that eliminates all the blocks (the goal of the puzzle).']
"Thus this example allows us measure the effectiveness of our search procedure.

Results are shown in Table 4.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task when attempting to match the humanspecified plan exactly.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"If we are purely concerned with task completion (i.e. solving the puzzle, perhaps not with the exact set of moves specified in the instructions) we can measure this directly.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, too, we substantially outperform a no-text baseline.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Thus it can be seen that text induces a useful heuristic, allowing the model to solve a considerable fraction of problem instances not solved by naı̈ve beam search.

"Even at present, the results in this section demonstrate the importance of lookahead and high-level reasoning in instruction following.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We have described a new alignment-based compositional model for following sequences of natural language instructions, and demonstrated the effectiveness of this model on a variety of tasks.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"A fully general solution to the problem of contextual interpretation must address a wide range of wellstudied problems, but the work we have described
here provides modular interfaces for the study of a number of fundamental linguistic issues from a machine learning perspective.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"These include:
Pragmatics How do we respond to presupposition failures, and choose among possible interpretations of an instruction disambiguated only by context?",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The mechanism provided by the sequence-prediction architecture we have described provides a simple answer to this question, and our experimental results demonstrate that the learned pragmatics aid interpretation of instructions in a number of concrete ways: ambiguous references are resolved by proximity in the map reading task, missing steps are inferred from an environment model in the maze navigation task, and vague hints are turned into real plans by knowledge of the rules in Crossblock.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"A more comprehensive solution might explicitly describe the process by which instruction-givers’ own beliefs (expressed as distributions over sequences) give rise to instructions.
