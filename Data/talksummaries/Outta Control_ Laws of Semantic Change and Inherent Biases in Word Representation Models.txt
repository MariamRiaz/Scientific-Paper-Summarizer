0	14	The increasing availability of digitized historical corpora, together with newly developed tools of computational analysis, make the quantitative study of language change possible on a larger scale than ever before.
2	69	This has catalyzed the evolution of an exciting new field of historical distributional semantics, which has yielded findings that inform our understanding of the dynamic structure of language (Sagi et al., 2009; Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011; Mitra et al., 2014; Hilpert and Perek, 2015; Frermann and Lapata, 2016; Dubossarsky et al., 2016).
3	122	Recent research has even proposed laws of change that predict the conditions under which the meaning of words is likely to change (Dubossarsky et al., 2015; Xu and Kemp, 2015; Hamilton et al., 2016).
4	54	This is an important development, as traditional historical linguistics has generally been unable to provide predictive models of semantic change.
6	100	To date, analyses of changes in words’ meanings have relied on the comparison of word representations at different points in time.
35	34	Complementary to the genuine condition, a control condition was created where no change of meaning is expected.
36	63	Therefore, any observed change in a word’s meaning in the control condition can only stem from random “noise“, while changes in meaning in the genuine condition are attributed to “real“ semantic change in addition to “noise“.
39	20	First, this condition resembles the genuine condition in size of the vocabulary, size of the corpus, overall variance in words’ usage, and size of the decadal bins.
50	22	To establish the adequacy of our control condition, we compared the meaning change scores (before log-transformation and standardization) between the genuine and the shuffled control conditions.
51	16	Change scores were obtained by taking the average meaning change over all words in each decade using the representation of the final processing stage (SVD).
52	16	An adequate control condition will exhibit a lower degree of change compared to the genuine condition, and is expected to show a fixed rate of change across decades (see 3a).
58	21	We report the predictor coefficient as well as the proportion of variance explained1 by each model.
81	31	Surprisingly, the negative correlation with frequency was reinstated (r = −0.793).
83	15	2, it turns out that the SVD procedure distorts data in an uneven manner - frequent words are distorted less than infrequent words.
84	16	Thus we demonstrate that this reinstatement of correlation between frequency and change scores is merely an artefactual consequence of the truncated SVD factorization.
88	51	In the genuine condition, words appear in different usage contexts between decades, while in the shuffled condition they do not, because the random shuffling creates a homogeneous corpus.
89	110	Therefore, the validity of the control condition is established if: (a) the change scores are diminished as compared to the genuine condition; (b) change scores are uniform across decades (since decades are shuffled); (c) the variance of change scores is smaller that in the genuine condition.
102	19	Furthermore, the fact that the correlation coefficients are virtually identical in the genuine and shuffled conditions, with r = −0.748 and r = −0.747 respectively, suggests that they are due to artefactual factors in both conditions and not to true change of meaning over time.
104	31	The relation between frequency and meaning change can also be represented by a linear mixed effect model, with the benefit that this model enables the addition of more explanatory variables to the data.
105	39	The regression model found frequency to have a negative influence on change scores, with βf=-0.91 and βf=-0.75, for the genuine and shuffled conditions respectively.
106	25	Importantly, frequency accounted for 67% of the variance in the change scores in the genuine condition, and was only slightly diminished in the shuffled condition, accounting for 56% of the variance.
110	67	Continuing the work described in Section 3.1, we replicated the model and analysis procedure described in (Hamilton et al., 2016), where two predictors were used together to explain the change scores: frequency and polysemy.
115	22	We then log-transformed and standardized the polysemy scores.
117	52	Thus we were able to replicate the results in the genuine condition as reported in (Hamilton et al., 2016).
118	75	Interestingly, the same pattern of results emerged, again, in the shuffled condition (see Table 1).
119	77	Importantly, the difference in effect size between conditions, as evaluated by the explained variance of frequency and polysemy together, showed a modest effect of 8% over the shuffled condition, pointing to the conclusion that the putative effects may indeed be real, but to a far lesser extent than had been claimed.
120	27	We conclude that adding polysemy to the analysis contributed very little to the model’s predictive power.
121	71	Since the PPMI representation (the explicit representation without dimensionality reduction with SVD) seems much less affected by spurious effects correlated with frequency (see Fig.
124	66	Prototypicality is the degree to which a word is representative of the category of which it is a member (a robin is a more prototypical bird than a parrot).
125	32	According to the proposed Law of Prototypicality, words with more prototypical meanings will show less semantic change, and vice versa.
