57	1	We assume that each feature in s and x, and y is zero-mean.
61	4	The value B̂⊤S is a part of x that is explainable by s. The following theorem states the learnability of the linear relation between x and s. Theorem 1.
69	2	Here, our interest lies in measuring the contribution of s to the estimator ŷ of the target variable y. Namely, let ŷ = s⊤α+ u⊤β be the estimator of y.
80	7	(2.3) is equivalently written as: min α⊤Vsα+ β⊤Vuβ − 2(E[ys⊤α] + E[yu⊤β]) s.t.
88	5	(Regularity condition) Covariance matrices Vs and Vu are full rank.
93	5	The first one solves the Lagrangian dual problem, which boils down to a semidefinite programming (SDP).
98	5	The Lagrangian dual problem of (3.1) is written as max ξ≥0 ϕ(ξ), (3.3) where ϕ(ξ) is the optimal function defined as ϕ(ξ)=min α,β [ α⊤β⊤ ] [Vs 0 0 Vu ] [ α β ] − 2 [ q⊤s q ⊤ u ] [α β ] + ξ [ α⊤β⊤ ] [Vs 0 0 −ϵVu ] [ α β ] .
100	2	Although a Lagrangian dual has a duality gap in general, the following theorem, which is well-known in the context of the control theory, assures the inexistence of the duality gap.
105	2	Instead, we solve the following dual problem of (3.4) defined as the optimization over a matrix A ∈ R(1+ds+dx)×(1+ds+dx): max A⪰0  0 −q⊤s −q⊤u−qs Vs 0 −qu 0 Vu  ·A s.t.

120	1	(3.6) The following theorem, which is derived in the context of global optimization (Yamada & Takeda, 2018), converts the nonconvex QCQP into a convex QCQP: Theorem 4.
129	2	In summary, Theorem 4 allows us to relax the constraint so that the new feasible region is convex without compromising its objective value.
130	2	As a result, (3.7), which is a convex QCQP, is computed efficiently by off-the-shelf optimizers.
136	2	In practice, our simulation in Appendix B shows SDP and convex QCQP appear to scale more similarly to O((ds + dx)2) around 10 ≤ ds + dx ≤ 3, 000, which is not very surprising because many instances scale better than the worst-case.

144	4	With an abuse of notation, let Ks andKu be the corresponding n×nmatrices, and cs, cu be corresponding size-n vectors.
154	3	This section verifies the performance of the proposed method in four real-world datasets.
155	3	Computation environment: The simulation here was conducted by using modern Xeon-core PC servers4.
156	6	Preliminary experiment (Appendix B) revealed that the running times of SDP and convex QCQP optimization are more or less the same.
159	5	Datasets: The Communities and Crime (C&C) dataset combines socio-economic data and crime rate data on communities in the United States where each datapoint corresponds to a community.
160	7	The target y is the normalized violent crime rate of each community and s(1), s(2) are the ratio of African American people and foreign-born people, respectively.
164	3	Statistics of the datasets are in Table 1, and further details of the datasets are in Appendix C. Evaluation settings: We split the data into 5-folds: One was for validation dataset that was used to optimize the hyperparameters, and another was for the test dataset.
165	3	The resting three folds were the training dataset.
177	1	We considered CoD that is a natural extension of the correlation coefficient into multiple sensitive attributes as a fairness criterion.
179	9	The proposed method has the following aspects: (i) The exact control on the fairness level as a constraint, (ii) a capability of dealing with numeric and multiple s and (iii) an extension that captures non-linear interaction between sensitive and non-sensitive attributes.
180	32	We consider this result as a first step that controls the nonconvexity that naturally appears in considering fairness related constraints.
181	170	While the prevention of disparate impact is justified by the legal contexts, some alternative criteria of fairness, such as the equality odds condition (Hardt et al., 2016; Zafar et al., 2017b), have been proposed.
182	171	Considering them as a constraint would be interesting.
