4	60	Moreover, as opposed to STEM fields in general, the proportion of women in Computer Science has been on a marked decline for the past two decades (Sax et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017), placing the entire the tech field in a diversity crisis today.
5	28	The discussion of gender representation or even the existence of a glass ceiling is rather more complex for NLP due to its fundamental interdisciplinarity especially across the fields of Linguistics, Computer Science, and Statistics.
6	31	That is, much mainstream research in NLP follows trends that are heavily situated in one of the main subdisciplines.
8	14	What about the preceding Machine Learning wave from the mid 2000s?
9	41	In this paper we answer this question in the affirmative.
10	207	We acquired a gender-annotated co-author dataset covering arguably the most central ACL publication venues for the past 52 years.
12	17	We make the following concerning empirical observations: 1.
26	15	The remaining 3232 author names were annotated by the current authors by manually inspecting the results of Google Image queries for the full name.
27	105	The resulting dataset spans 52 years and includes 17,232 authors, of which we labeled 10,382 as male, 5,227 as female and 1,623 whose gender we could not identify.
30	26	In our study, we need to account for mentor status–a type of seniority and power.
36	107	, 10}, and excluding all sole-author papers, a researcher is considered to hold mentor standing with seniority threshold t. We model the interactions between researchers by creating the bi-populated (for female and male populations) mentor-mentee network.
37	24	The network’s nodes therefore are researchers and there is an edge between two co-authors of a paper in our dataset if and only if one of the co-authors is the last author.
55	64	We further investigate the subset of female researchers who achieved mentor standing, and compare their difficulty in doing so with that of the respective pool of male researchers.
57	33	Isolating a substantially larger delay to achieving mentor standing for female researchers is one way to use our dataset to measure the difficulty in transitioning female researchers from mentee to mentor standing.
59	97	For consecutive periods of two years, we compute the average number of years for researchers to achieve mentor standing at threshold t ∈ {2, .
62	38	We observe that across all thresholds for mentor standing, female researchers are substantially more delayed than male researchers in becoming mentors.
65	13	The availability of female mentors been has shown to correlate with mentees’ future success–in particular, females in Chemistry who are mentored by female supervisors are considerably more likely to become faculty themselves (Gaule and Piacentini, 2018).
72	24	First three key observations can be made of the mentor-mentee network introduced in Section 2 vis-à-vis three well-accepted mechanisms of observed human behavior.
73	18	(O1) Minority-majority partition.
88	26	Avin et al. (2015) extend Barabási and Albert (1999)’s preferential attachment model that was originally based on the “rich-get-richer” feedback mechanism to a biased preferential attachment model of mentor-mentee dynamics, G(n, f, p), where there further is (1) a minority-majority partition (the proportion of female nodes is less than half, f < 12 ) and (2) homophily.
90	260	Over time, a sequence of bi-populated mentor-mentee networks is constructed, Gt = (Vt, Et), like the one described in Section 2.
91	22	Vt = Ft ∪Mt is the set of Gt’s nodes, and Et its edges, where Ft(Mt) is the set of female (male) nodes.
93	36	The mentee is a female with probability f and a male with probabilitym = 1−f .
96	46	However if genders differ, then the relation (edge) is established according to the probability of homophily (p); otherwise (with proba- bility (1 − p)) it is rejected and the mentee must restart the process of finding a mentor.
100	32	The sequence of mentor-mentee networks Gt is said to exhibit a power inequality effect for females if the average power of a female node is strictly bounded by the power of a male node: i.e., limt→∞ 1 |Ft| ∑ v∈Ft δt(v) 1 |Mt| ∑ v∈Mt δt(v) < 1.
103	82	The glass ceiling effect for the minority of females describes a process by which the proportion of access to this wealth of relations is limited for females but not for males.
106	14	And if g = 0, Gt has a strong glass ceiling effect.
108	35	Avin et al. (2015) proved that if 0 < f < 12 and 0 < p < 1, then for G(n, f, p) produced by the biased preferential attachment model, G(n, f, p) exhibits both power inequality and a tail and strong glass ceiling effects.
110	26	We have therefore shown there to exist power inequality and a glass ceiling in NLP.
111	43	Given our study of the mentee-mentor network for NLP, we have shown that there is a glass ceiling for female researchers in NLP that has taken a hold of the field since the mid-2000s.
