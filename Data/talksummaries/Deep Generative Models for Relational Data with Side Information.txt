0	85	Statistical modeling of complex real-world networks is an important problem, drawing attention from diverse domains, such as social network analysis, biology, political science, etc.
1	20	(Fortunato, 2010; Goldenberg et al.; Schmidt & Morup, 2013).
2	30	The goal in statistical modeling of networks is usually to discover the underlying groups or community structure in the network, and/or predicting the existence of potential links between nodes.
3	35	A common way of accomplishing this is by embedding the nodes in a latent space via latent space models (Hoff et al., 2002).
5	93	An appealing class of models is the latent feature relational model (LFRM) (Miller et al., 2009), often also called the overlapping stochastic blockmodel (Latouche et al., 2011), which associates with each node a latent binary vector that can be thought of as the node’s overlapping memberships to one or more latent clusters in the network.
14	18	Another appealing aspect of our model is its ability to in- corporate side information (given as node attributes) via a regression model that maps the node attributes to node latent features.
17	19	In particular, leveraging data-augmentation techniques allows us achieve full local conjugacy and enables us to develop a simple Gibbs sampler for model inference.
36	41	Akin to the deep sigmoid belief-nets (Neal, 1992; Gan et al., 2015), we condition each node’s latent features in layer ` on its latent features in layer `+ 1 via a weight matrix W(`) ∈ RK`×K`+1 (Fig.
43	140	If available, side information associated with the nodes in the network can be incorporated in this framework by conditioning the bottom-most layer (i.e., layer 1) latent features Z(1) on the side information (Fig.
48	61	Note that, as opposed to conditioning the link Aij on the side information, in our model construction we choose to condition the latent features of each node on its side information.
57	35	This construction has the appealing property that if Aij = 0 then the associated latent counts are zero with probability one and need not be estimated during model inference.
58	23	Therefore, this can lead to huge computational speed-ups for sparse data with many zeros (which is usually the case with real world networks which are very sparse).
59	19	In the case of modeling relational data such as networks, this implies that the inference cost scales in the number of edges in the network, unlike other overlapping stochastic blockmodels such as LFRM (Miller et al., 2009; Zhu, 2012).
60	58	These models use a logistic link function for the edges, which requires likelihood evaluations for both edges as well as non-edges.
67	37	Moreover, unlike the model in (Zhou, 2015) which cannot leverage side information, our framework allows incorporating the side information of each node in predicting the node’s latent features.

74	42	To see this, note that using the likelihood model given by Eq.
119	41	We consider three instances of our hierarchical latent feature model (HLFM): one-layer HLFM, two-layer HLFM, and two-layer HLFM with side information.
123	25	The model is based on learning non-negative embeddings for each node.
124	26	• Community-Affiliation Graph Model (AGM) (Yang & Leskovec, 2012): This model is an overlapping community detection model based on learning a binary latent feature vector (akin to our approach and latent feature relational models (Miller et al., 2009)).
125	27	• Nonparametric Metadata Dependent Relational Model (NMDR) (Kim et al., 2011): This model is based on the nonparametric Bayesian mixedmembership blockmodel and, in the same spirit as our model, allows conditioning a node’s cluster memberships on metadata associated with that node.
155	24	Table 1 reports the results on the two data sets that do not have side information and Table 2 reports the results on the other four data sets with side information.
162	49	Except for Conflicts data, where our model gets outperformed by HGP-EPN, our two layer model with side information significantly outperforms the baselines on most of the data sets.
163	18	In particular, our model yields better AUC scores than the other best performing baseline NMDR (Kim et al., 2011) which can, like our model, incorporate side information.
165	27	It is interesting to note that neither NMDR nor the twolayer HLFM with side information outperform HGP-EPM on Conflicts data in terms of the link prediction performance.
171	26	Essentially, the nonzero entries in each column of the matrix correspond to the nodes that belong to a cluster in layer `.
175	35	To further show the discovered clusters at multiple layers and the interrelationships between clusters: (1) In Table 4, we show the learned clusters of countries in layer 1 and layer 2; (2) In Figure 4, we show the inferred correlation-based pairwise similarities between the layer 1 clusters.
179	46	Interestingly, unlike layer 1 clusters, the countries grouped together in layer 2 clusters are not necessarily related by the virtue of being geographically close.
182	55	For example, during the Gulf war (1991, recorded in Conflicts data between 1990-2000), Iraq (Middle East) was involved disputes with the coalition members which included countries like Hungary, Italy, Netherlands (Europe).
184	59	This analysis demonstrates that the multilayer architecture of our model not only yields significantly improved link-prediction accuracies but also enables us in gaining better insights into the data by means of more interpretable latent features and clusterings, which may be useful in their own right in many applications.
