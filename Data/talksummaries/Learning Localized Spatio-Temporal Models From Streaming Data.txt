7	17	In real-world applications, Dn need not be gathered in a single batch but obtained in parts over time from various sensors, stations, satellites, etc.
8	9	That is, the dataset is augmented sequentially, i.e., n = 1, 2, .
9	33	In these streaming data scenarios, we are interested in continuous refinement of the prediction of y at (s, t) as new data is augmented into Dn+1.
47	21	For the test point (s, t), we consider the unbiased predictor of y as a linear combination of the data (Stein, 2012): ŷ(s, t) = λ>(s, t)y, (1) where λ>(s, t) is a vector of n weights which naturally depend on the test point (s, t).
70	8	We begin by specifying the spatial function as ϕ(s) = ϕ1(s1)⊗ · · · ⊗ϕd(sd), (7) where the basis vector for the ith spatial dimension, ϕi(si) = col{ ϕi,1(si), · · · , ϕi,Ns(si) } (8) is composed of Ns localized components with a finite support L. For notational simplicity, we consider Ns and L to be same for each dimension i.
81	17	(9) However, to be able to predict missing data of the type illustrated in Figure 1 we cannot rely on a localized basis for extended interpolations over space-time.
89	34	Given a training dataset Dn, this approach enables us to update the predictor ŷθ(s, t) = λ>θ (s, t)y from (1) in a streaming fashion as n = 1, 2, .
91	11	Let us first define a normalized sample covariance matrix of the training data, K̃ = (y − 1η)(y − 1η)> ‖y − 1η‖2 .
92	12	Then the optimal model parameters are given by a covariance-fitting criterion (cf.

155	40	Figure 6a shows the prediction error histogram of all test points across the spatio-temporal domain.
162	13	We pick a spatial point in a region where the El Niño effect, i.e., the periodic warming of the equatorial Pa- cific Sea Surface (Sarachik & Cane, 2010), is known to be noticeable.
163	43	The prediction of the SST anomalies at this spatial location across time along with the true SST is illustrated with Figure 6d.
166	14	The precipitation data consists of monthly rainfall in millimeter over a period from 1901 to 2012 obtained with high spatial resolution (0.5 by 0.5 degree) over the whole planet.
169	28	The spatial region indicated by the black dashed box in Figure 7b beyond month t = 47, as seen in Figure 7c, constitutes a contiguous test region, in addition to other randomly selected test points.
170	12	The remaining N = 14 400 points are used for training.
175	8	Figure 7b shows the contour plot of predicted precipitation for a spatial slice at month t = 54.
176	11	The red cross and plus marker indicate spatial points whose actual and predicted time series are compared in Figures 7c and 7d, respectively.
177	47	Note that the estimated precipitation tracks the true precipitation well everywhere even to the right of the black dashed line where the data was not seen during training.
179	9	We proposed a method in which a spatio-temporal predictor ŷθ̂(s, t) can be learned and updated sequentially as spatio-temporal data is obtained as a stream.
180	14	It is capable of capturing spatially varying temporal patterns, using a non-stationary covariance model that is learned using a covariance-fitting approach.
181	15	We demonstrated, using both simulated and real climate data, that it is capable of producing accurate predictions in large unobserved space-time test regions.
182	22	In future work, we intend to further improve the computational efficiency of the method by exploiting the spatially localized structure of the covariance model.
