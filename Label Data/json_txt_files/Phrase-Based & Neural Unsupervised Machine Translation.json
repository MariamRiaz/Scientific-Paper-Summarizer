A major challenge is the reliance of current learning algorithms on large parallel corpora. Unfortunately, the vast majority of language pairs have very little, if any, parallel data: learning algorithms need to better leverage monolingual data in order to make MT more widely applicable.\nWhile a large body of literature has studied the use of monolingual data to boost translation performance when limited supervision is available, two recent approaches have explored the fully unsupervised setting (Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2018), relying only on monolingual corpora in each language, as in the pioneering work by Ravi and Knight (2011). While there are subtle technical differences between these two recent works, we identify several common principles underlying their success.\nFirst, they carefully initialize the MT system with an inferred bilingual dictionary. Second, they leverage strong language models, via training the sequence-to-sequence system (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) as a denoising autoencoder (Vincent et al., 2008). Third, they turn the unsupervised problem into a supervised one by automatic generation of sentence pairs via back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2015a), i.e., the source-to-target model is applied to source sentences to generate inputs for training the targetto-source model, and vice versa. Finally, they constrain the latent representations produced by the encoder to be shared across the two languages. Empirically, these methods achieve remarkable results considering the fully unsupervised setting; for instance, about 15 BLEU points on the WMT\u201914 English-French benchmark.\nThe first contribution of this paper is a model\nar X\niv :1\n80 4.\n07 75\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n3 A\nug 2\n01 8\nthat combines these two previous neural approaches, simplifying the architecture and loss function while still following the above mentioned principles. The resulting model outperforms previous approaches and is both easier to train and tune. Then, we apply the same ideas and methodology to a traditional phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) system (Koehn et al., 2003). PBSMT models are well-known to outperform neural models when labeled data is scarce because they merely count occurrences, whereas neural models typically fit hundred of millions of parameters to learn distributed representations, which may generalize better when data is abundant but is prone to overfit when data is scarce. Our PBSMT model is simple, easy to interpret, fast to train and often achieves similar or better results than its NMT counterpart. We report gains of up to +10 BLEU points on widely used benchmarks when using our NMT model, and up to +12 points with our PBSMT model. Furthermore, we apply these methods to distant and low-resource languages, like EnglishRussian, English-Romanian and English-Urdu, and report competitive performance against both semi-supervised and supervised baselines."}, {"heading": "2 Principles of Unsupervised MT", "text": "Learning to translate with only monolingual data is an ill-posed task, since there are potentially many ways to associate target with source sentences. Nevertheless, there has been exciting progress towards this goal in recent years, as discussed in the related work of Section 5. In this sec-\ntion, we abstract away from the specific assumptions made by each prior work and instead focus on identifying the common principles underlying unsupervised MT.\nWe claim that unsupervised MT can be accomplished by leveraging the three components illustrated in Figure 1: (i) suitable initialization of the translation models, (ii) language modeling and (iii) iterative back-translation. In the following, we describe each of these components and later discuss how they can be better instantiated in both a neural model and phrase-based model.\nInitialization: Given the ill-posed nature of the task, model initialization expresses a natural prior over the space of solutions we expect to reach, jump-starting the process by leveraging approximate translations of words, short phrases or even sub-word units (Sennrich et al., 2015b). For instance, Klementiev et al. (2012) used a provided bilingual dictionary, while Lample et al. (2018) and Artetxe et al. (2018) used dictionaries inferred in an unsupervised way (Conneau et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2017). The motivating intuition is that while such initial \u201cword-by-word\u201d translation may be poor if languages or corpora are not closely related, it still preserves some of the original semantics.\nLanguage Modeling: Given large amounts of monolingual data, we can train language models on both source and target languages. These models express a data-driven prior about how sentences should read in each language, and they improve the quality of the translation models by per-\nAlgorithm 1: Unsupervised MT 1 Language models: Learn language models Ps and Pt\nover source and target languages; 2 Initial translation models: Leveraging Ps and Pt,\nlearn two initial translation models, one in each direction: P (0)s\u2192t and P (0) t\u2192s;\n3 for k=1 to N do 4 Back-translation: Generate source and target\nsentences using the current translation models, P (k\u22121) t\u2192s and P (k\u22121) s\u2192t , factoring in language\nmodels, Ps and Pt; 5 Train new translation models P (k)s\u2192t and P (k) t\u2192s\nusing the generated sentences and leveraging Ps and Pt;\n6 end\nforming local substitutions and word reorderings.\nIterative Back-translation: The third principle is back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2015a), which is perhaps the most effective way to leverage monolingual data in a semi-supervised setting. Its application in the unsupervised setting is to couple the source-to-target translation system with a backward model translating from the target to source language. The goal of this model is to generate a source sentence for each target sentence in the monolingual corpus. This turns the daunting unsupervised problem into a supervised learning task, albeit with noisy source sentences. As the original model gets better at translating, we use the current model to improve the back-translation model, resulting in a coupled system trained with an iterative algorithm (He et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "3 Unsupervised MT systems", "text": "Equipped with the three principles detailed in Section 2, we now discuss how to effectively combine them in the context of a NMT model (Section 3.1) and PBSMT model (Section 3.2).\nIn the reminder of the paper, we denote the space of source and target sentences by S and T , respectively, and the language models trained on source and target monolingual datasets by Ps and Pt, respectively. Finally, we denote by Ps\u2192t and Pt\u2192s the translation models from source to target and vice versa. An overview of our approach is given in Algorithm 1."}, {"heading": "3.1 Unsupervised NMT", "text": "We now introduce a new unsupervised NMT method, which is derived from earlier work by Artetxe et al. (2018) and Lample et al. (2018). We first discuss how the previously mentioned\nthree key principles are instantiated in our work, and then introduce an additional property of the system, the sharing of internal representations across languages, which is specific and critical to NMT. From now on, we assume that a NMT model consists of an encoder and a decoder. Section 4 gives the specific details of this architecture.\nInitialization: While prior work relied on bilingual dictionaries, here we propose a more effective and simpler approach which is particularly suitable for related languages.2 First, instead of considering words, we consider byte-pair encodings (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015b), which have two major advantages: they reduce the vocabulary size and they eliminate the presence of unknown words in the output translation. Second, instead of learning an explicit mapping between BPEs in the source and target languages, we define BPE tokens by jointly processing both monolingual corpora. If languages are related, they will naturally share a good fraction of BPE tokens, which eliminates the need to infer a bilingual dictionary. In practice, we i) join the monolingual corpora, ii) apply BPE tokenization on the resulting corpus, and iii) learn token embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the same corpus, which are then used to initialize the lookup tables in the encoder and decoder.\nLanguage Modeling: In NMT, language modeling is accomplished via denoising autoencoding, by minimizing:\nLlm = Ex\u223cS [\u2212 logPs\u2192s(x|C(x))] + Ey\u223cT [\u2212 logPt\u2192t(y|C(y))] (1)\nwhere C is a noise model with some words dropped and swapped as in Lample et al. (2018). Ps\u2192s andPt\u2192t are the composition of encoder and decoder both operating on the source and target sides, respectively.\nBack-translation: Let us denote by u\u2217(y) the sentence in the source language inferred from y \u2208 T such that u\u2217(y) = argmaxPt\u2192s(u|y). Similarly, let us denote by v\u2217(x) the sentence in the target language inferred from x \u2208 S such that v\u2217(x) = argmaxPs\u2192t(v|x). The pairs (u\u2217(y), y) and (x, v\u2217(x))) constitute automatically-generated parallel sentences which, following the back-translation principle, can be\n2For unrelated languages, we need to infer a dictionary to properly initialize the embeddings (Conneau et al., 2018).\nused to train the two MT models by minimizing the following loss:\nLback = Ey\u223cT [\u2212 logPs\u2192t(y|u\u2217(y))] + Ex\u223cS [\u2212 logPt\u2192s(x|v\u2217(x))]. (2)\nNote that when minimizing this objective function we do not back-prop through the reverse model which generated the data, both for the sake of simplicity and because we did not observe improvements when doing so. The objective function minimized at every iteration of stochastic gradient descent, is simply the sum of Llm in Eq. 1 and Lback in Eq. 2. To prevent the model from cheating by using different subspaces for the language modeling and translation tasks, we add an additional constraint which we discuss next.\nSharing Latent Representations: A shared encoder representation acts like an interlingua, which is translated in the decoder target language regardless of the input source language. This ensures that the benefits of language modeling, implemented via the denoising autoencoder objective, nicely transfer to translation from noisy sources and eventually help the NMT model to translate more fluently. In order to share the encoder representations, we share all encoder parameters (including the embedding matrices since we perform joint tokenization) across the two languages to ensure that the latent representation of the source sentence is robust to the source language. Similarly, we share the decoder parameters across the two languages. While sharing the encoder is critical to get the model to work, sharing the decoder simply induces useful regularization. Unlike prior work (Johnson et al., 2016), the first token of the decoder specifies the language the module is operating with, while the encoder does not have any language identifier."}, {"heading": "3.2 Unsupervised PBSMT", "text": "In this section, we discuss how to perform unsupervised machine translation using a PhraseBased Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) system (Koehn et al., 2003) as the underlying backbone model. Note that PBSMT models are known to perform well on low-resource language pairs, and are therefore a potentially good alternative to neural models in the unsupervised setting.\nWhen translating from x to y, a PBSMT system scores y according to: argmaxy P (y|x) = argmaxy P (x|y)P (y), where P (x|y) is derived\nfrom so called \u201cphrase tables\u201d, and P (y) is the score assigned by a language model.\nGiven a dataset of bitexts, PBSMT first infers an alignment between source and target phrases. It then populates phrase tables, whose entries store the probability that a certain n-gram in the source/target language is mapped to another ngram in the target/source language.\nIn the unsupervised setting, we can easily train a language model on monolingual data, but it is less clear how to populate the phrase tables, which are a necessary component for good translation. Fortunately, similar to the neural case, the principles of Section 2 are effective to solve this problem.\nInitialization: We populate the initial phrase tables (from source to target and from target to source) using an inferred bilingual dictionary built from monolingual corpora using the method proposed by Conneau et al. (2018). In the following, we will refer to phrases as single words, but the very same arguments trivially apply to longer ngrams. Phrase tables are populated with the scores of the translation of a source word to:\np(tj |si) = e 1 T cos(e(tj),We(si))\u2211\nk e 1 T cos(e(tk),We(si))\n, (3)\nwhere tj is the j-th word in the target vocabulary and si is the i-th word in the source vocabulary, T is a hyper-parameter used to tune the peakiness of the distribution3, W is the rotation matrix mapping the source embeddings into the target embeddings (Conneau et al., 2018), and e(x) is the embedding of x.\nLanguage Modeling: Both in the source and target domains we learn smoothed n-gram language models using KenLM (Heafield, 2011), although neural models could also be considered. These remain fixed throughout training iterations.\nIterative Back-Translation: To jump-start the iterative process, we use the unsupervised phrase tables and the language model on the target side to construct a seed PBSMT. We then use this model to translate the source monolingual corpus into the target language (back-translation step). Once the data has been generated, we train a PBSMT in supervised mode to map the generated data back to the original source sentences. Next, we perform\n3We set T = 30 in all our experiments, following the setting of Smith et al. (2017).\nboth generation and training process but in the reverse direction. We repeat these steps as many times as desired (see Algorithm 2 in Section A).\nIntuitively, many entries in the phrase tables are not correct because the input to the PBSMT at any given point during training is noisy. Despite that, the language model may be able to fix some of these mistakes at generation time. As long as that happens, the translation improves, and with that also the phrase tables at the next round. There will be more entries that correspond to correct phrases, which makes the PBSMT model stronger because it has bigger tables and it enables phrase swaps over longer spans."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We first describe the datasets and experimental protocol we used. Then, we compare the two proposed unsupervised approaches to earlier attempts, to semi-supervised methods and to the very same models but trained with varying amounts of labeled data. We conclude with an ablation study to understand the relative importance of the three principles introduced in Section 2."}, {"heading": "4.1 Datasets and Methodology", "text": "We consider five language pairs: English-French, English-German, English-Romanian, EnglishRussian and English-Urdu. The first two pairs are used to compare to recent work on unsupervised MT (Artetxe et al., 2018; Lample et al., 2018). The last three pairs are instead used to test our PBSMT unsupervised method on truly low-resource pairs (Gu et al., 2018) or unrelated languages that do not even share the same alphabet.\nFor English, French, German and Russian, we use all available sentences from the WMT monolingual News Crawl datasets from years 2007 through 2017. For Romanian, the News Crawl dataset is only composed of 2.2 million sentences, so we augment it with the monolingual data from WMT\u201916, resulting in 2.9 million sentences. In Urdu, we use the dataset of Jawaid et al. (2014), composed of about 5.5 million monolingual sentences. We report results on newstest 2014 for en\u2212 fr, and newstest 2016 for en\u2212 de, en\u2212 ro and en\u2212 ru. For Urdu, we use the LDC2010T21 and LDC2010T23 corpora each with about 1800 sentences as validation and test sets, respectively.\nWe use Moses scripts (Koehn et al., 2007) for tokenization. NMT is trained with 60,000 BPE\ncodes. PBSMT is trained with true-casing, and by removing diacritics from Romanian on the source side to deal with their inconsistent use across the monolingual dataset (Sennrich et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Initialization", "text": "Both the NMT and PBSMT approaches require either cross-lingual BPE embeddings (to initialize the shared lookup tables) or n-gram embeddings (to initialize the phrase table). We generate embeddings using fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) with an embedding dimension of 512, a context window of size 5 and 10 negative samples. For NMT, fastText is applied on the concatenation of source and target corpora, which results in crosslingual BPE embeddings.\nFor PBSMT, we generate n-gram embeddings on the source and target corpora independently, and align them using the MUSE library (Conneau et al., 2018). Since learning unique embeddings of every possible phrase would be intractable, we consider the most frequent 300,000 source phrases, and align each of them to its 200 nearest neighbors in the target space, resulting in a phrase table of 60 million phrase pairs which we score using the formula in Eq. 3.\nIn practice, we observe a small but significant difference of about 1 BLEU point using a phrase table of bigrams compared to a phrase table of unigrams, but did not observe any improvement using longer phrases. Table 1 shows an extract of a French-English unsupervised phrase table, where we can see that unigrams are correctly aligned to bigrams, and vice versa."}, {"heading": "4.3 Training", "text": "The next subsections provide details about the architecture and training procedure of our models."}, {"heading": "4.3.1 NMT", "text": "In this study, we use NMT models built upon LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) cells.

Following Press and Wolf (2016), we share all lookup tables between the encoder and the decoder, and between the source and the target languages. The dimensionality of the embeddings and of the hidden layers is set to 512. We used the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10\u22124, \u03b21 = 0.5, and a batch size of 32.

We either set them to their default values in the toolbox, or we set them using a small validation set of parallel sentences. It turns out\nthat with only 100 labeled sentences in the validation set, PBSMT would overfit to the validation set. For instance, on en \u2192 fr, PBSMT tuned on 100 parallel sentences obtains a BLEU score of 26.42 on newstest 2014, compared to 27.09 with default hyper-parameters, and 28.02 when tuned on the 3000 parallel sentences of newstest 2013. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, all PBSMT models considered in the paper use default hyperparameter values, and do not use any parallel resource whatsoever.\nFor the NMT, we also consider two model selection procedures: an unsupervised criterion based on the BLEU score of a \u201cround-trip\u201d translation (source \u2192 target \u2192 source and target \u2192 source \u2192 target) as in Lample et al. (2018), and crossvalidation using a small validation set with 100 parallel sentences. In our experiments, we found the unsupervised criterion to be highly correlated with the test metric when using the Transformer model, but not always for the LSTM. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, we select the best LSTM models using a small validation set of 100 parallel sentences, and the best Transformer models with the unsupervised criterion."}, {"heading": "4.5 Results", "text": "The results reported in Table 2 show that our unsupervised NMT and PBSMT systems largely outperform previous unsupervised baselines. We report large gains on all language pairs and directions. For instance, on the en \u2192 fr task, our unsupervised PBSMT obtains a BLEU score of 28.1, outperforming the previous best result by more than 11 BLEU points. Even on a more complex task like en \u2192 de, both PBSMT and NMT surpass the baseline score by more than 10 BLEU\npoints. Even before iterative back-translation, the PBSMT model significantly outperforms previous approaches, and can be trained in a few minutes.\nTable 3 illustrates the quality of the PBSMT model during the iterative training process. For instance, the fr \u2192 en model obtains a BLEU score of 17.5 at iteration 0 \u2013 i.e. after the unsupervised phrase table construction \u2013 while it achieves a score of 27.2 at iteration 4. This highlights the importance of multiple back-translation iterations. The last rows of Table 3 also show that we get additional gains by further tuning the NMT model on the data generated by PBSMT (PBSMT + NMT). We simply add the data generated by the unsupervised PBSMT system to the back-translated data produced by the NMT model. By combining PBSMT and NMT, we achieve BLEU scores of 20.2 and 25.2 on the challenging en \u2192 de and de \u2192 en translation tasks. While we also tried bootstraping the PBSMT model with back-translated data generated by a NMT model (NMT + PBSMT), this did not improve over PBSMT alone.\nNext, we compare to fully supervised models. Figure 2 shows the performance of the same architectures trained in a fully supervised way using parallel training sets of varying size. The unsupervised PBSMT model achieves the same performance as its supervised counterpart trained on more than 100,000 parallel sentences.\nThis is confirmed on low-resource languages. In particular, on ro \u2192 en, our unsupervised PBSMT model obtains a BLEU score of 23.9, outperforming Gu et al. (2018)\u2019s method by 1 point, despite its use of 6,000 parallel sentences, a seed dictionary, and a multi-NMT system combining par-\nallel resources from 5 different languages. On Russian, our unsupervised PBSMT model obtains a BLEU score of 16.6 on ru\u2192 en, showing that this approach works reasonably well on distant languages. Finally we train on ur \u2192 en, which is both low resource and distant. In a supervised mode, PBSMT using the noisy and outof-domain 800,000 parallel sentences from Tiedemann (2012) achieves a BLEU score of 9.8. Instead, our unsupervised PBSMT system achieves 12.3 BLEU using only a validation set of 1800 sentences to tune Moses hyper-parameters."}, {"heading": "4.6 Ablation Study", "text": "In Figure 3 we report results from an ablation study, to better understand the importance of the three principles when training PBSMT. This study shows that more iterations only partially compensate for lower quality phrase table initialization (Left), language models trained over less data (Middle) or less monolingual data (Right). Moreover, the influence of the quality of the language model becomes more prominent as we iterate. These findings suggests that better initialization methods and more powerful language models may further improve our results.\nWe perform a similar ablation study for the NMT system (see Appendix). We find that backtranslation and auto-encoding are critical components, without which the system fails to learn. We also find that initialization of embeddings is very important, and we gain 7 BLEU points compared to prior work (Artetxe et al., 2018; Lample et al., 2018) by learning BPE embeddings over the concatenated monolingual corpora."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "A large body of literature has studied using monolingual data to boost translation performance when limited supervision is available. This limited supervision is typically provided as a small set of parallel sentences (Sennrich et al., 2015a; Gulcehre et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018); large sets of parallel sentences in related languages (Firat et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2017); cross-lingual dictionaries (Klementiev et al., 2012; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2014, 2016); or comparable corpora (Munteanu et al., 2004; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013).\nLearning to translate without any form of supervision has also attracted interest, but is challenging. In their seminal work, Ravi and Knight (2011) leverage linguistic prior knowledge to reframe the unsupervised MT task as deciphering and demonstrate the feasibility on short sentences with limited vocabulary. Earlier work by Carbonell et al. (2006) also aimed at unsupervised MT, but leveraged a bilingual dictionary to seed the translation. Both works rely on a language model on the target side to correct for translation fluency.\nSubsequent work (Klementiev et al., 2012; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2014, 2016) relied on bilingual dictionaries, small parallel corpora of several thousand sentences, and linguistically motivated features to prune the search space. Irvine and Callison-Burch (2014) use monolingual data to expand phrase tables learned in a supervised setting. In our work we also expand phrase tables, but we initialize them with an inferred bilingual n-gram dictionary, following work from the connectionist community aimed at improving PBSMT with neural models (Schwenk, 2012; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014).\nIn recent years back-translation has become a\npopular method of augmenting training sets with monolingual data on the target side (Sennrich et al., 2015a), and has been integrated in the \u201cdual learning\u201d framework of He et al. (2016) and subsequent extensions (Wang et al., 2018). Our approach is similar to the dual learning framework, except that in their model gradients are backpropagated through the reverse model and they pretrain using a relatively large amount of labeled data, whereas our approach is fully unsupervised.\nFinally, our work can be seen as an extension of recent studies (Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) on fully unsupervised MT with two major contributions. First, we propose a much simpler and more effective initialization method for related languages. Second, we abstract away three principles of unsupervised MT and apply them to a PBSMT, which even outperforms the original NMT.

All results are for the en\u2192 fr task.\nFirst, we analyze the effect of different initialization methods for the embedding matrices. If we switch from BPE tokens to words, BLEU drops by 4 points. If we used BPE but train embeddings in each language independently and then map them via MUSE (Conneau et al., 2018), BLEU drops by 3 points. Finally, compared to the word aligned procedure used by Lample et al. (2018), based on words and MUSE, the gain is about 7 points. To stress the importance of initialization, we also report performance using random initialization of BPE embeddings. In this case, convergence is much slower and to a much lower accuracy, achieving a BLEU score of 10.5.\nThe table also demonstrates the critical importance of the auto-encoding and back-translation terms in the loss, and the robustness of our approach to choice of architectures.\nA.2 Qualitative study Table 5 shows example translations from the French-English newstest 2014 dataset at different\niterations of the learning algorithm for both NMT and PBSMT models. Prior to the first iteration of back-translation, using only the unsupervised phrase table, the PBSMT translations are similar to word-by-word translations and do not respect the syntax of the target language, yet still contain most of the semantics of the original sentences. As we increase the number of epochs in NMT and as we iterate for PBSMT, we observe a continuous improvement in the quality of the unsupervised translations. Interestingly, in the second example, both the PBSMT and NMT models fail to adapt to the polysemy of the French word \u201clangue\u201d, which can be translated as \u201ctongue\u201d or \u201clanguage\u201d in English. These translations were both present in the unsupervised phrase table, but the conditional probability of \u201clanguage\u201d to be the correct translation of \u201clangue\u201d was very high compared to the one of \u201ctongue\u201d: P (language|langue) = 0.92, while P (tongue|langue) = 0.0005. As a comparison, the phrase table of a Moses model trained in a supervised way contains P (language|langue) = 0.633, P (tongue|langue) = 0.0076, giving a higher probability for \u201clangue\u201d to be properly translated. This underlines the importance of the initial unsupervised phrase alignment procedure, as it was shown in Figure 1.\nFinally, in Table 6 we report a random subset of test sentences translated from Russian to English, showing that the model mostly retains the semantics, while making some mistakes in the grammar as well as in the choice of words and entities. In Table 7, we show examples of translations from German to English with PBSMT, NMT, and PBSMT+NMT to show how the combination of these models performs better than them individually.\nGerman\u2192 English\nSource Flu\u0308chtlinge brauchen Unterku\u0308nfte : Studie warnt vor Wohnungslu\u0308cke PBSMT Refugees need accommodation : Study warns Wohnungslu\u0308cke NMT Refugees need forestry study to warn housing gap PBSMT+NMT Refugees need accommodation : Study warns of housing gap Reference Refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap\nSource Konflikte : Mehrheit unterstu\u0308tzt die Anti-IS-Ausbildungsmission PBSMT Conflict : Majority supports Anti-IS-Ausbildungsmission NMT Tensions support majority anti-IS-recruiting mission PBSMT+NMT Tensions : Majority supports the anti-IS-recruitment mission Reference Conflicts : the majority support anti ISIS training mission\nSource Roboterautos : Regierung will Vorreiterrolle fu\u0308r Deutschland PBSMT Roboterautos : Government will step forward for Germany NMT Robotic cars will pre-reiterate government for Germany PBSMT+NMT Robotic cars : government wants pre-orders for Germany Reference Robot cars : Government wants Germany to take a leading role\nSource Pfund steigt durch beschleunigtes Lohnwachstum im Vereinigten Ko\u0308nigreich PBSMT Pound rises as UK beschleunigtes Lohnwachstum .

This work investigates how to learn to translate when having access to only large monolingual corpora in each language. We propose two model variants, a neural and a phrase-based model. Both versions leverage a careful initialization of the parameters, the denoising effect of language models and automatic generation of parallel data by iterative back-translation. These models are significantly better than methods from the literature, while being simpler and having fewer hyper-parameters. On the widely used WMT\u201914 English-French and WMT\u201916 German-English benchmarks, our models respectively obtain 28.1 and 25.2 BLEU points without using a single parallel sentence, outperforming the state of the art by more than 11 BLEU points. On low-resource languages like English-Urdu and English-Romanian, our methods achieve even better results than semisupervised and supervised approaches leveraging the paucity of available bitexts.
