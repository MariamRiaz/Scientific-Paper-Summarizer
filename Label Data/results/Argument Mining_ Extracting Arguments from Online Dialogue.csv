"Dependency parsing is a longstanding natural language processing task, with its outputs crucial to various downstream tasks including relation extraction (Schmitz et al., 2012; Angeli et al., 2015), language modeling (Gubbins and Vlachos, 2013), and natural logic inference (Bowman et al., 2016).

"Attractive for their linear time complexity and amenability to conventional classification methods, transition-based dependency parsers have sparked much research interest recently.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A transition-based parser makes sequential predictions of transitions between states under the restrictions of a transition system (Nivre, 2003).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Transition-based parsers have been shown to excel at parsing shorter-range dependency structures, as well as languages where non-projective parses are less pervasive (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the transition systems employed in state-of-the-art dependency parsers usually define very local transitions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"At each step, only one or two words are affected, with very local attachments made.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, distant attachments require long and not immediately obvious transition sequences (e.g., ate→chopsticks in Figure 1, which requires two transitions).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is further aggravated by the usually local lexical information leveraged to make transition predictions (Chen and Manning, 2014; Andor et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we introduce a novel transition system, arc-swift, which defines non-local transitions that directly induce attachments of distance up to n (n = the number of tokens in the sentence).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such an approach is connected to graph-based dependency parsing, in that it leverages pairwise scores between tokens in making parsing decisions (McDonald et al., 2005).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We make two main contributions in this paper.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Firstly, we introduce a novel transition system for dependency parsing, which alleviates the difficulty of distant attachments in previous systems by allowing direct attachments anywhere in the stack.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Secondly, we compare parsers by the number of mistakes they make in common linguistic con-

We show that arc-swift parsers reduce errors in attaching prepositional phrases and conjunctions compared to parsers using existing transition systems.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Transition-based dependency parsing is performed by predicting transitions between states (see Figure 1 for an example).,2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Parser states are usually written as (σ|i, j|β,A), where σ|i denotes the stack with token i on the top, j|β denotes the buffer with token j at its leftmost, and A the set of dependency arcs.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Given a state, the goal of a dependency parser is to predict a transition to a new state that would lead to the correct parse.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"A transition system defines a set of transitions that are sound and complete for parsers, that is, every transition sequence would derive a well-formed parse tree, and every possible parse tree can also be derived from some transition sequence.1
Arc-standard (Nivre, 2004) is one of the first transition systems proposed for dependency parsing.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"It defines three transitions: shift, left arc (LArc), and right arc (RArc) (see Figure 2 for definitions, same for the following transition systems), where all arc-inducing transitions operate on the stack.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"This system builds the parse bottom-up, i.e., a constituent is only attached to its head after it has received all of its dependents.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"A potential drawback is that during parsing, it is difficult to predict if a constituent has consumed all of its right dependents.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Arc-eager (Nivre, 2003) remedies this drawback by defining arc-inducing transitions that operate between the stack and the buffer.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"As a result, a constituent no longer needs to be complete
1We only focus on projective parses for the scope of this paper.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"before it can be attached to its head to the left, as a right arc doesn’t prevent the attached dependent from taking further dependents of its own.2 Kuhlmann et al. (2011) propose a hybrid system derived from a tabular parsing scheme, which they have shown both arc-standard and arc-eager can be derived from.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Arc-hybrid combines LArc from arc-eager and RArc from arc-standard to build dependencies bottom-up.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"3 Non-local Transitions with arc-swift
The traditional transition systems discussed in Section 2 only allow very local transitions affecting one or two words, which makes long-distance dependencies difficult to predict.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"To illustrate the limitation of local transitions, consider parsing the following sentences:
I ate fish with ketchup.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"I ate fish with chopsticks.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"The two sentences have almost identical structures, with the notable difference that the prepositional phrase is complementing the direct object in the first case, and the main verb in the second.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"For arc-standard and arc-hybrid, the parser would have to decide between Shift and RArc when the parser state is as shown in Figure 3a, where ? stands for either “ketchup” or “chopsticks”.3 Similarly, an arc-eager parser would deal with the state shown in Figure 3b.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Making the correct transition requires information about context words “ate” and “fish”, as well as “?”.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
2A side-effect of arc-eager is that there is sometimes spurious ambiguity between Shift and Reduce transitions.,2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"For the example in Figure 1, the first Reduce can be inserted before the third Shift without changing the correctness of the resulting parse, i.e., both are feasible at that time.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"3For this example, we assume that the sentence is being parsed into Universal Dependencies.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Parsers employing traditional transition systems would usually incorporate more features about the context in the transition decision, or employ beam search during parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Andor et al., 2016).
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"In contrast, inspired by graph-based parsers, we propose arc-swift, which defines non-local transitions as shown in Figure 2.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"This allows direct comparison of different attachment points, and provides a direct solution to parsing the two example sentences.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"When the arc-swift parser encounters a state identical to Figure 3b, it could directly compare transitions RArc[1] and RArc[2] instead of evaluating between local transitions.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"This results in a direct attachment much like that in a graph-based parser, informed by lexical information about affinity of the pairs of words.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
Arc-swift also bears much resemblance to arceager.,2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"In fact, an LArc[k] transition can be viewed as k− 1 Reduce operations followed by one LArc in arc-eager, and similarly for RArc[k].",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Reduce is no longer needed in arc-swift as it becomes part of LArc[k] and RArc[k], removing the ambiguity in derived transitions in arc-eager.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"arc-swift is also equivalent to arc-eager in terms of soundness and completeness.4 A caveat is that the worst-case time complexity of arc-swift is O(n2) instead of O(n), which existing transition-based parsers enjoy.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"However, in practice the runtime is nearly
4This is easy to show because in arc-eager, all Reduce transitions can be viewed as preparing for a later LArc or RArc transition.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"We also note that similar to arc-eager transitions, arc-swift transitions must also satisfy certain pre-conditions.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Specifically, an RArc[k] transition requires that the top k − 1 elements in the stack are already attached; LArc[k] additionally requires that the k-th element is unattached, resulting in no more than one feasible LArc candidate for any parser state.

"The results are shown in Table 1.5 Note that K&G 2016 is trained with a dynamic oracle (Goldberg and Nivre, 2012), Andor 2016 with a CRF-like loss, and both Andor 2016 and Weiss 2015 employed beam search (with sizes 32 and 8, respectively).

We also analyzed the performance of parsers on attachments of different distances.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 4, arc-swift is equally accurate as existing systems for short dependencies, but is more robust for longer ones.
",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"While arc-swift introduces direct long-distance transitions, it also shortens the overall sequence necessary to induce the same parse.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"A parser could potentially benefit from both factors: direct attachments could make an easier classification task, and shorter sequences limit the effect of error propagation.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"However, since the two effects are correlated in a transition system, precise attribution of the gain is out of the scope of this paper.

"On the PTBSD development set, the average transition sequence length per sentence of arc-swift is 77.5% of that of arc-eager.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"At each step of parsing, arc-swift needs to evaluate only about 1.24 times the number of transition candidates as arc-eager, which results in very similar runtime.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"In contrast, beam search with beam size 2 for arc-eager requires evaluating 4 times the number of transition candidates compared to greedy parsing, which results in a UAS 0.14% worse and LAS 0.22% worse for arc-eager compared to greedily decoded arcswift.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"We automatically extracted all labelled attachment errors by error type (incorrect attachment or relation), and categorized a few top parser errors by hand into linguistic constructions.",4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
"Results on PTB-SD are shown in Table 3.7 We note that the arc-swift parser improves accuracy on prepositional phrase (PP) and conjunction attachments, while it remains comparable to other parsers on other common errors.",4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
Analysis on EN-UD shows a similar trend.,4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
"As shown in the table, there are still many parser errors unaccounted for in our analysis.",4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
"We leave this to future work.
",4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
"7We notice that for some examples the parsers predicted a ccomp (complement clause) attachment to verbs “says” and “said”, where the CoreNLP output simply labelled the relation as dep (unspecified).",4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
For other examples the relation between the prepositions in “out of” is labelled as prep (preposition) instead of pcomp (prepositional complement).,4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
"We suspect this is due to the converter’s inability to handle certain corner cases, but further study is warranted.",4.3 Linguistic Analysis,[0],[0]
Previous work has also explored augmenting transition systems to facilitate longer-range attachments.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Attardi (2006) extended the arcstandard system for non-projective parsing, with arc-inducing transitions that are very similar to those in arc-swift.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
A notable difference is that their transitions retain tokens between the head and dependent.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Fernández-González and GómezRodrı́guez (2012) augmented the arc-eager system with transitions that operate on the buffer, which shorten the transition sequence by reducing the number of Shift transitions needed.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, limited by the sparse feature-based classifiers used, both of these parsers just mentioned only allow direct attachments of distance up to 3 and 2, respectively.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More recently, Sartorio et al. (2013) extended arc-standard with transitions that directly attach to left and right “spines” of the top two nodes in the stack.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"While this work shares very similar motivations as arc-swift, it requires additional data structures to keep track of the left and right spines of nodes.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This transition system also introduces spurious ambiguity where multiple transition sequences could lead to the same correct parse, which necessitates easy-first training to achieve a more noticeable improvement over arcstandard.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, arc-swift can be easily implemented given the parser state alone, and does not give rise to spurious ambiguity.
",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For a comprehensive study of transition systems for dependency parsing, we refer the reader to (Bohnet et al., 2016), which proposed a generalized framework that could derive all of the traditional transition systems we described by configuring the size of the active token set and the maximum arc length, among other control parameters.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, this framework does not cover
arc-swift in its original form, as the authors limit each of their transitions to reduce at most one token from the active token set (the buffer).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the framework presented in (GómezRodrı́guez and Nivre, 2013) does not explicitly make this constraint, and therefore generalizes to arc-swift.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, we note that arc-swift still falls out of the scope of existing discussions in that work, by introducing multiple Reduces in a single transition.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we introduced arc-swift, a novel transition system for dependency parsing.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We also performed linguistic analyses on parser outputs and showed arc-swift parsers reduce errors in conjunction and adverbial attachments compared to parsers using traditional transition systems.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]

Arc-swift: A Novel Transition System for Dependency Parsing,title,[0],[0]
"1 Are BLEU and Meaning Representation in Opposition?
One of possible ways of obtaining continuous-space sentence representations is by training neural machine translation (NMT) systems. The recent attention mechanism however removes the single point in the neural network from which the source sentence representation can be extracted. We propose several variations of the attentive NMT architecture bringing this meeting point back. Empirical evaluation suggests that the better the translation quality, the worse the learned sentence representations serve in a wide range of classification and similarity tasks.",text,[0],[0]
Deep learning has brought the possibility of automatically learning continuous representations of sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the one hand, such representations can be geared towards particular tasks such as classifying the sentence in various aspects (e.g. sentiment, register, question type) or relating the sentence to other sentences (e.g. semantic similarity, paraphrasing, entailment).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, we can aim at “universal” sentence representations, that is representations performing reasonably well in a range of such tasks.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Regardless the evaluation criterion, the representations can be learned either in an unsupervised way (from simple, unannotated texts) or supervised, relying on manually constructed training sets of sentences equipped with annotations of the appropriate type.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A different approach is to obtain sentence representations from training neural machine translation models (Hill et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since Hill et al. (2016), NMT has seen substantial advances in translation quality and it is thus
natural to ask how these improvements affect the learned representations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One of the key technological changes was the introduction of “attention” (Bahdanau et al., 2014), making it even the very central component in the network (Vaswani et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Attention allows the NMT system to dynamically choose which parts of the source are most important when deciding on the current output token.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a consequence, there is no longer a static vector representation of the sentence available in the system.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we remove this limitation by proposing a novel encoder-decoder architecture with a structured fixed-size representation of the input that still allows the decoder to explicitly focus on different parts of the input.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In other words, our NMT system has both the capacity to attend to various parts of the input and to produce static representations of input sentences.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We train this architecture on English-to-German and English-to-Czech translation and evaluate the learned representations of English on a wide range of tasks in order to assess its performance in learning “universal” meaning representations.

"We adopt an alternative approach, which is to use inner attention1 (Liu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) to compute several weighted averages of the encoder states (Lin et al., 2017).",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"The main motivation for incorporating these multiple “views” of the state sequence is that it removes the need for the RNN cell to accumulate the representation of the whole sentence as it processes the input, and therefore it should have more capacity for modeling local dependencies.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we fix a number r, the number of attention heads, and compute an r×T matrixA of attention weights αjt, representing the importance of position t in the input for the jth attention head.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"We then use this matrix to compute r weighted sums of the encoder states, which become the rows of a new matrix M : M = AH.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
(1) A vector representation of the source sentence (the “sentence embedding”) can be obtained by flattening the matrix M .,3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, we project the encoder states h1, h2, . . .",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
", hT down to a given dimensionality before applying Eq.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"(1), so that we can control the size of the representation.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"Following Lin et al. (2017), we compute the attention matrix by feeding the encoder states to a two-layer feed-forward network: A = softmax(U tanh(WH>)), (2) where W and U are weight matrices of dimensions d× u and r × d, respectively (d is the number of hidden units); the softmax function is applied along the second dimension, i.e. across the encoder states.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
1Some papers call the same or similar approach selfattention or single-time attention.,3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
Attentive decoder.,3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"In vanilla seq2seq models with a fixed-size sentence representation, the decoder is usually conditioned on this representation via the initial RNN state.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
We propose to instead leverage the structured sentence embedding by applying attention to its components.,3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"This is no different from the classical attention mechanism used in NMT (Bahdanau et al., 2014), except that it acts on this fixed-size representation instead of the sequence of encoder states.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"In the ith decoding step, the attention mechanism computes a distribution {βij}rj=1 over the r components of the structured representation.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"This is then used to weight these components to obtain the context vector ci, which in turn is used to update the decoder state.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"Again, we can write this in matrix form as C = BM, (3) where B = (βij) T ′,r i=1,j=1 is the attention matrix and C = (ci, c2, . . .",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
", cT ′) are the context vectors.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
Note that by combining Eqs.,3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"(1) and (3), we get C = (BA)H. (4) Hence, the composition of the encoder and decoder attentions (the “compound attention”) defines an implicit alignment between the source and the target sequence.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"From this viewpoint, our model can be regarded as a restriction of the conventional attention model.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"The decoder uses a conditional GRU cell (cGRUatt; Sennrich et al., 2017), which consists of two consecutively applied GRU blocks.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"The first block processes the previous target token yi−1, while the second block receives the context vector ci and predicts the next target token yi.",3.1 Compound Attention,[0],[0]
"Compared to the FINAL model, the compound attention architecture described in the previous section undoubtedly benefits from the fact that the decoder is presented with information from the encoder (i.e. the context vectors ci) in every decoding step.",3.2 Constant Context,[0],[0]
"To investigate this effect, we include baseline models where we replace all context vectors ci with the entire sentence embedding (indicated by the suffix “-CTX” in Table 1).",3.2 Constant Context,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we provide either the flattened matrixM (for models with inner attention; ATTN or ATTN-CTX), the final state of the encoder (FINAL-CTX), or the
4
result of mean- or max-pooling (*POOL-CTX) as a constant input to the decoder cell.",3.2 Constant Context,[0],[0]
"The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a recently proposed model based entirely on feedforward layers and attention.",3.3 Transformer with Inner Attention,[0],[0]
"It consists of an encoder and a decoder, each with 6 layers, consisting of multi-head attention on the previous layer and a position-wise feed-forward network.",3.3 Transformer with Inner Attention,[0],[0]
"In order to introduce a fixed-size sentence representation into the model, we modify it by adding inner attention after the last encoder layer.",3.3 Transformer with Inner Attention,[0],[0]
The attention in the decoder then operates on the components of this representation (i.e. the rows of the matrix M ).,3.3 Transformer with Inner Attention,[0],[0]
This variation on the Transformer model corresponds to the ATTN-ATTN column in Table 1 and is therefore denoted TRF-ATTN-ATTN.,3.3 Transformer with Inner Attention,[0],[0]
"Continuous sentence representations can be evaluated in many ways, see e.g. Kiros et al. (2015), Conneau et al. (2017) or the RepEval workshops.2 We evaluate our learned representations with classification and similarity tasks from SentEval (Section 4.1) and by examining clusters of sentence paraphrase representations (Section 4.2).",4 Representation Evaluation,[0],[0]

"As the baseline for classifications tasks, we assign the most frequent class to all test examples.8",5.2 SentEval,[0],[0]
"The de models are generally worse, most likely due to the higher OOV rate and overall simplicity of the training sentences.",5.2 SentEval,[0],[0]

",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"A good sign is that on the cs dataset, most metrics of representation are positively correlated (the pairwise Pearson correlation is 0.78± 0.32 on average), the outlier being TREC (−0.16±0.16 correlation with the other metrics on average)
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, most representation metrics correlate with BLEU negatively (−0.57±0.31) on cs.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The pattern is less pronounced but still clear also on the de dataset.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"A detailed understanding of what the learned
representations contain is difficult.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"We can only speculate that if the NMT model has some capability for following the source sentence superficially, it will use it and spend its capacity on closely matching the target sentences rather than on deriving some representation of meaning which would reflect e.g. semantic similarity.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
We assume that this can be a direct consequence of NMT being trained for cross entropy: putting the exact word forms in exact positions as the target sentence requires.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Performing well in single-reference BLEU is not an indication that the system understands the meaning but rather that it can maximize the chance of producing the n-grams required by the reference.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The negative correlation between the number of attention heads and the representation metrics from Fig. 3 (−0.81±0.12 for cs and−0.18±0.19 for de, on average) can be partly explained by the following observation.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
We plotted the induced alignments (e.g. Fig. 4) and noticed that the heads tend to “divide” the sentence into segments.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"While one would hope that the segments correspond to some meaningful units of the sentence (e.g. subject, predicate, object), we failed to find any such interpretation for ATTN-ATTN and for cs models in general.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Instead, the heads divide the source sentence more or less equidistantly, as documented by Fig. 5.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Such a multi-headed sentence representation is then less fit for representing e.g. paraphrases where the subject and object swap their position due to passivization, because their representations are then accessed by different heads, and thus end up in different parts of the sentence embedding vector.

For de-ATTN-CTX models, we observed a much flatter distribution of attention weights for each head and, unlike in the other models, we were often able to identify a head focusing on the main verb.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This difference between ATTN-ATTN and some ATTN-CTX models could be explained by the fact that in the former, the decoder is oblivious to the ordering of the heads (because of decoder attention), and hence it may not be useful for a given head to look for a specific syntactic or semantic role.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"We presented a novel variation of attentive NMT models (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) that again provides a single meeting point with a continuous representation of the source sen-
tence.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We evaluated these representations with a number of measures reflecting how well the meaning of the source sentence is captured.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"While our proposed “compound attention” leads to translation quality not much worse than the fully attentive model, it generally does not perform well in the meaning representation.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Quite on the contrary, the better the BLEU score, the worse the meaning representation.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We believe that this observation is important for representation learning where bilingual MT now seems less likely to provide useful data, but perhaps more so for MT itself, where the struggle towards a high single-reference BLEU score (or even worse, cross entropy) leads to systems that refuse to consider the meaning of the sentence.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"Argument mining consists of the automatic identification of argumentative structures in documents, a valuable task with applications in policy making, summarization, and education, among others.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The argument mining task includes the tightly-knit subproblems of classifying propositions into elementary unit types and detecting argumentative relations between the elementary units.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The desired output is a document argumentation graph structure, such as the one in Figure 1, where propositions are denoted by letter subscripts, and the associated argumentation graph shows their types and support relations between them.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most annotation and prediction efforts in argument mining have focused on tree or forest structures (Peldszus and Stede, 2015; Stab and Gurevych, 2016), constraining argument structures to form one or more trees.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This makes the problem computationally easier by enabling the use of maximum spanning tree–style parsing ap-
proaches.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, argumentation in the wild can be less well-formed.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The argument put forth in Figure 1, for instance, consists of two components: a simple tree structure and a more complex graph structure (c jointly supports b and d).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we design a flexible and highly expressive structured prediction model for argument mining, jointly learning to classify elementary units (henceforth propositions) and to identify the argumentative relations between them (henceforth links).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"By formulating argument mining as inference in a factor graph (Kschischang et al., 2001), our model (described in Section 4) can account for correlations between the two tasks, can consider second order link structures (e.g., in Figure 1, c → b → a), and can impose arbitrary constraints (e.g., transitivity).

for argument mining,4 Structured learning,[0],[0]
"Binary and multi-class classification have been applied with some success to proposition and link prediction separately, but we seek a way to jointly learn the argument mining problem at the document level, to better model contextual dependencies and constraints.",4.1 Preliminaries,[0],[0]
"We therefore turn to structured learning, a framework that provides the desired level of expressivity.

"We denote the propositions in a document by {a, b, c, ...} and the possible directed link between a and b as a → b.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
The argument structure we seek to predict consists of the type of each proposition ya ∈ P and a binary label for each link ya→b ∈,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]

Unary potentials.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
Each proposition a and each link a → b has a corresponding random variable in the factor graph (the circles in Figure 2).,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"To encode the model’s belief in each possible value for these variables, we parametrize the unary factors (gray boxes in Figure 2) with unary potentials: φ(a) ∈ R|P| is a score of ya for each possible proposition type.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"Similarly, link unary potentials φ(a → b) ∈ R|R| are scores for ya→b being on/off.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"Without any other factors, this would amount to independent classifiers for each task.
",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
Compatibility factors.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"For every possible link a → b, the variables (a, b, a → b) are bound by a dense factor scoring their joint assignment (the black boxes in Figure 2).",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"Such a factor could automatically learn to encourage links from compatible types (e.g., from TESTIMONY to POLICY) or discourage links between less compatible ones (e.g., from FACT to TESTIMONY).",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"In the simplest form, this factor would be parametrized as a tensor T ∈ R|P|×|P|×|R|, with tijk retaining the score of a source proposition of type i to be (k = on) or not to be (k = off) in a link with a proposition of type j. For more flexibility, we parametrize this factor with compatibility features depending
only on simple structure: tijk becomes a vector, and the score of configuration (i, j, k) is given by v>abtijk where vab consists of three binary features:
• bias: a constant value of 1, allowing T to learn a base score for a label configuration (i, j, k), as in the simple form above,
• adjacency: when there are no other propositions between the source and the target,
• order: when the source precedes the target.

Second order factors.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
Local argumentation graph structures such as a → b → c might be modeled better together rather than through separate link factors for a → b and b → c.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"As in higher-order structured models for semantic and dependency parsing (Martins et al., 2013; Martins and Almeida, 2014), we implement three types of second order factors: grandparent (a → b → c), sibling (a ← b → c), and co-parent (a → b ← c).",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"Not all of these types of factors make sense on all datasets: as sibling structures cannot exist in directed trees, we don’t use sibling factors on UKP.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"On CDCP, by transitivity, every grandparent structure implies a corresponding sibling, so it is sufficient to parametrize siblings.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"This difference between datasets is emphasized in Figure 2, where one example of each type of factor is pictured on the right side of the graphs (orange boxes with curved edges): on CDCP we illustrate a coparent factor (top right) and a sibling factor (bot-
tom right), while on UKP we show a co-parent factor (top right) and a grandparent factor (bottom right).",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"We call these factors second order because they involve two link variables, scoring the joint assignment of both links being on.

Valid link structure.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
The global structure of argument links can be further constrained using domain knowledge.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
We implement this using constraint factors; these have no parameters and are denoted by empty boxes in Figure 2.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"In general, well-formed arguments should be cycle-free.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"In the UKP dataset, links form a directed forest and can never cross paragraphs.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"This particular constraint can be expressed as a series of tree factors,8 one for each paragraph (the factor connected to all link variables in Figure 2).",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"In CDCP, links do not form a tree, but we use logic constraints to enforce transitivity (top left factor in Figure 2) and to prevent symmetry (bottom left); the logic formulas implemented by these factors are described in Table 1.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"Together, the two constraints have the desirable side effect of preventing cycles.
",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
Strict constraints.,4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"We may include further domain-specific constraints into the model, to express certain disallowed configurations.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"For instance, proposition types that appear in CDCP data can be ordered by the level of objectivity (Park et al., 2015a), as shown in Table 1.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"In a wellformed argument, we would want to see links from more objective to equally or less objective propositions: it’s fine to provide FACT as reason for VALUE, but not the other way around.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"While the training data sometimes violates this constraint, enforcing it might provide a useful inductive bias.
Inference.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"The argmax in Equation 1 is a MAP over a factor graph with cycles and many overlapping factors, including logic factors.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"While exact inference methods are generally unavailable, our setting is perfectly suited for the Alternating Directions Dual Decomposition (AD3) algorithm: approximate inference on expressive factor graphs with overlapping factors, logic constraints, and generic factors (e.g., directed tree factors) defined through maximization oracles (Martins et al., 2015).",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]

"At test time, for analysis, we retrieve exact solutions using the branch-and-bound method.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"At training time, however, fractional solutions can be used as-is; this makes better use of each iteration and actually increases the ratio of integral solutions in future iterations, as well as at test time, as proven by Meshi et al. (2016).",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"We also find that after around 15 training iterations with fractional solutions, over 99% of inference calls are integral.

"The max in Equation 2 is not the same as the one used for prediction, in Equation 1.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"However, when the cost function ρ decomposes over the variables, cost-augmented inference amounts to regular inference after augmenting the potentials accordingly.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"We use a weighted Hamming cost:
ρ(y, ŷ)",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
":= ∑ v ρ(yv)I[yv = ŷv]
where v is summed over all variables in a document {a} ∪ {a → b}, and ρ(yv) is a misclassification cost.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"We assign uniform costs ρ to 1 for all mistakes except false-negative links, where we use higher cost proportional to the class imbalance in the training split, effectively giving more weight to positive links during training.",4.2 Model description,[0],[0]
"One option for parameterizing the potentials of the unary and higher-order factors is with linear models, using proposition, link, and higher-order features.",4.3 Argument structure SVM,[0],[0]
"This gives birth to a linear structured SVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005), which, when using l2 regularization, can be trained efficiently in the dual using the online block-coordinate FrankWolfe algorithm of Lacoste-Julien et al. (2013), as implemented in the pystruct library (Müller and Behnke, 2014).",4.3 Argument structure SVM,[0],[0]

Features.,4.3 Argument structure SVM,[0],[0]
"For unary proposition and link features, we faithfully follow Stab and Gurevych (2016, Tables 9 and 10): proposition features are
lexical (unigrams and dependency tuples), structural (token statistics and proposition location), indicators (from hand-crafted lexicons), contextual, syntactic (subclauses, depth, tense, modal, and POS), probability, discourse (Lin et al., 2014), and average GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014).",4.3 Argument structure SVM,[0],[0]
"Link features are lexical (unigrams), syntactic (POS and productions), structural (token statistics, proposition statistics and location features), hand-crafted indicators, discourse triples, PMI, and shared noun counts.

"Our proposed higher-order factors for grandparent, co-parent, and sibling structures require features extracted from a proposition triplet a, b, c. In dependency and semantic parsing, higher-order factors capture relationships between words, so sparse indicator features can be efficiently used.",4.3 Argument structure SVM,[0],[0]
"In our case, since propositions consist of many words, BOW features may be too noisy and too dense; so for simplicity we again take a cue from the link-specific features used by Stab and Gurevych (2016).",4.3 Argument structure SVM,[0],[0]
"Our higher-order factor features are: same sentence indicators (for all 3 and for each pair), proposition order (one for each of the 6 possible orderings), Jaccard similarity (between all 3 and between each pair), presence of any shared nouns (between all 3 and between each pair), and shared noun ratios: nouns shared by all 3 divided by total nouns in each proposition and each pair, and shared nouns between each pair with respect to each proposition.",4.3 Argument structure SVM,[0],[0]

Online forums are now one of the primary venues for public dialogue on current social and political issues.,1 Introduction,[1.0],['Online forums are now one of the primary venues for public dialogue on current social and political issues.']
"The related corpora are often huge, covering any topic imaginable, thus providing novel opportunities to address a number of open questions about the structure of dialogue.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our aim is to use these dialogue corpora to automatically discover the semantic aspects of arguments that conversants are making across multiple dialogues on a topic.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We build a new dataset of 109,074 posts on the topics gay marriage, gun control, death penalty and evolution.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We frame our problem as consisting of two separate tasks:
• Argument Extraction: How can we extract argument segments in dialogue that clearly express a particular argument facet?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
• Argument,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Facet Similarity: How can we recognize that two argument segments are semantically similar, i.e. about the same facet of the argument?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Consider for example the sample posts and responses in Fig. 1.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Argument segments that are good targets for argument extraction are indicated, in their dialogic context, in bold.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['Argument segments that are good targets for argument extraction are indicated, in their dialogic context, in bold.']"
"Given extracted segments, the argument facet similarity module should recognize that R3 and R4 paraphrase the same argument facet, namely that there is a strong relationship between the availability of guns and the murder rate.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper addresses only the argument extraction task, as an important first step towards producing argument summaries that reflect the range and type of arguments being made,

on a topic, over time, by citizens in public forums.",1 Introduction,[1.0000000054036302],"['This paper addresses only the argument extraction task, as an important first step towards producing argument summaries that reflect the range and type of arguments being made, 217 on a topic, over time, by citizens in public forums.']"
"Our approach to the argument extraction task is driven by a novel hypothesis, the IMPLICIT MARKUP hypothesis.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We posit that the arguments that are good candidates for extraction will be marked by cues (implicit markups) provided by the dialog conversants themselves, i.e. their choices about the surface realization of their arguments.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We examine a number of theoretically motivated cues for extraction, that we expect to be domain-independent.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We describe how we use these cues to sample from the corpus in a way that lets us test the impact of the hypothesized cues.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Both the argument extraction and facet similarity tasks have strong similarities to other work in natural language processing.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Argument extraction resembles the sentence extraction phase of multi-document summarization.,1 Introduction,[1.0],['Argument extraction resembles the sentence extraction phase of multi-document summarization.']
"Facet similarity resembles semantic textual similarity and paraphrase recognition (Misra et al., 2015; Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2014; Conrad et al., 2012; Han et al., 2013; Agirre et al., 2012).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Work on multidocument summarization also uses a similar module to merge redundant content from extracted candidate sentences (Barzilay, 2003; Gurevych and Strube, 2004; Misra et al., 2015).
",1 Introduction,[1.0000000363150576],"['Work on multidocument summarization also uses a similar module to merge redundant content from extracted candidate sentences (Barzilay, 2003; Gurevych and Strube, 2004; Misra et al., 2015).']"
"Sec. 2 describes our corpus of arguments, and describes the hypothesized markers of highquality argument segments.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We sample from the corpus using these markers, and then annotate the extracted argument segments for ARGUMENT QUALITY.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Sec. 3.2 describes experiments to test whether: (1) we can predict argument quality; (2) our hypothesized cues are good indicators of argument quality; and (3) an argument quality predictor trained on one topic or a set of topics can be used on unseen topics.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The results in Sec. 4 show that we can predict argument quality with RRSE values as low as .73 for some topics.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Cross-domain training combined with domainadaptation yields RRSE values for several topics as low as .72, when trained on topic independent features, however some topics are much more difficult.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We provide a comparison of our work to previous research and sum up in Sec. 5.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We created a large corpus consisting of 109,074 posts on the topics gay marriage (GM, 22425 posts), gun control (GC, 38102 posts), death penalty (DP, 5283 posts) and evolution (EV, 43624), by combining the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC) (Walker et al., 2012), with dialogues from http://www.createdebate.com/.
Our aim is to develop a method that can extract high quality arguments from a large corpus of argumentative dialogues, in a topic and domain-
independent way.",2 Corpus and Method,[0],[0]
It is important to note that arbitrarily selected utterances are unlikely to be high quality arguments.,2 Corpus and Method,[0],[0]
"Consider for example all the utterances in Fig. 1: many utterances are either not interpretable out of context, or fail to clearly frame an argument facet.",2 Corpus and Method,[0],[0]
Our IMPLICIT MARKUP hypothesis posits that arguments that are good candidates for extraction will be marked by cues from the surface realization of the arguments.,2 Corpus and Method,[0],[0]
We first describe different types of cues that we use to sample from the corpus in a way that lets us test their impact.,2 Corpus and Method,[0],[0]
"We then describe the MT HIT, and how we use our initial HIT results to refine our sampling process.",2 Corpus and Method,[0],[0]
"Table 2 presents the results of our sampling and annotation processes, which we will now explain in more detail.",2 Corpus and Method,[0],[0]
"The IMPLICIT MARKUP hypothesis is composed of several different sub-hypotheses as to how speakers in dialogue may mark argumentative structure.
",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"The Discourse Relation hypothesis suggests that the Arg1 and Arg2 of explicit SPECIFICATION, CONTRAST, CONCESSION and CONTINGENCY markers are more likely to contain good argumentative segments (Prasad et al., 2008).",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[1.0],"['The Discourse Relation hypothesis suggests that the Arg1 and Arg2 of explicit SPECIFICATION, CONTRAST, CONCESSION and CONTINGENCY markers are more likely to contain good argumentative segments (Prasad et al., 2008).']"
"In the case of explicit connectives, Arg2 is the argument to which the connective is syntactically bound, and Arg1 is the other argument.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"For example, a CONTINGENCY relation is frequently marked by the lexical anchor If, as in R1 in Fig. 1.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"A CONTRAST relation may mark a challenge to an opponent’s claim, what Ghosh et al. call callout-target argument pairs (Ghosh et al., 2014b; Maynard, 1985).",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"The CONTRAST relation is frequently marked by But, as in R3 and R4 in Fig. 1.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"A SPECIFICATION relation may indicate a focused detailed argument, as marked by First in R2 in Fig. 1 (Li and Nenkova, 2015).",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"We decided to extract only the Arg2, where the discourse argument is syntactically bound to the connective, since Arg1’s are more difficult to locate, especially in dialogue.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"We began by extracting the Arg2’s for the connectives most strongly associated with these discourse relations over the whole corpus, and then once we saw what the most frequent connectives were in our corpus, we refined this selection to include only but, if, so, and first.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[1.0],"['We began by extracting the Arg2’s for the connectives most strongly associated with these discourse relations over the whole corpus, and then once we saw what the most frequent connectives were in our corpus, we refined this selection to include only but, if, so, and first.']"
"We sampled a roughly even distribution of sentences from each category as well as sentences without any discourse connectives, i.e. None.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
See Table.,2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"2.
",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"The Syntactic Properties hypothesis posits that syntactic properties of a clause may indicate good argument segments, such as being the main clause (Marcu, 1999), or the sentential complement of mental state or speech-act verbs, e.g. the SBAR
in you agree that SBAR as in P2 in Fig. 1.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"Because these markers are not as frequent in our corpus, we do not test this with sampling: rather we test it as a feature as described in Sec. 3.2.
",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"The Dialogue Structure hypothesis suggests that position in the post or the relation to a verbatim quote could influence argument quality, e.g. being turn-initial in a response as exemplified by P2, R3 and R4 in Fig. 1.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
We indicate sampling by position in post with Starts:,2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]

Our corpora are drawn from websites that offer a “quoting affordance” in addition to a direct reply.,2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"An example of a post from the IAC corpus utilizing this mechanism is shown in Table 1, where the quoted text is highlighted in blue and the response is directly below it.
",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"The Semantic Density hypothesis suggests that measures of rich content or SPECIFICITY will indicate good candidates for argument extraction (Louis and Nenkova, 2011).",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
We initially posited that short sentences and sentences without any topic-specific words are less likely to be good.,2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"For the topics gun control and gay marriage, we filtered sentences less than 4 words long, which removed about 8-9% of the sentences.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[1.0],"['For the topics gun control and gay marriage, we filtered sentences less than 4 words long, which removed about 8-9% of the sentences.']"
"After collecting the argument quality annotations for these two topics and examining the distribution of scores (see Sec. 2.2 below), we developed an additional measure of semantic density that weights words in each candidate by its pointwise mutual information (PMI), and applied it to the evolution and death penalty.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"Using the 26 topic annotations in the IAC, we calculate the PMI between every word in the corpus appearing more than 5 times and each topic.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
We only keep those sentences that have at least one word whose PMI is above our threshold of 0.1.,2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]
"We determined this threshold by examining the values in gun control and gay marriage, such that at least 2/3 of the filtered sentences were in the bottom third of the argument quality score.",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[1.0],"['We determined this threshold by examining the values in gun control and gay marriage, such that at least 2/3 of the filtered sentences were in the bottom third of the argument quality score.']"
"The PMI filter eliminates 39% of the sentences from death penalty (40% combined with the length filter) and 85% of the sentences from
evolution (87% combined with the length filter).",2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[1.0000000369805984],['The PMI filter eliminates 39% of the sentences from death penalty (40% combined with the length filter) and 85% of the sentences from evolution (87% combined with the length filter).']
Table 2 summarizes the results of our sampling procedure.,2.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis,[0],[0]

"The effect of the sampling on
argument quality can be seen in Table 2.","2.2 Data Sampling, Annotation and Analysis",[0],[0]

We can now briefly validate some of the IMPLICIT MARKUP hypothesis using an ANOVA testing the effect of a connective and its position in post on argument quality.,3.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis Validation,[1.0],['We can now briefly validate some of the IMPLICIT MARKUP hypothesis using an ANOVA testing the effect of a connective and its position in post on argument quality.']
"Across all sentences in all topics, the presence of a connective is significant (p = 0.00).",3.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis Validation,[0],[0]
"Three connectives, if, but, and so, show significant differences in AQ from no-connective phrases (p = 0.00, 0.02, 0.00, respectively).",3.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis Validation,[0],[0]
First does not show a significant effect.,3.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis Validation,[0],[0]
"The mean AQ scores for sentences marked by if, but, and so differ from that of a no-connective sentence by 0.11, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively.",3.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis Validation,[0],[0]
"These numbers support our hypothesis that there are certain discourse connectives or cue words which can help to signal the existence of arguments, and they seem to suggest that the CONTINGENCY category may be most useful, but more research using more cue words is necessary to validate this suggestion.
",3.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis Validation,[0],[0]
"In addition to the presence of a connective, the dialogue structural position of being an initial sentence in a response post did not predict argument quality as we expected.",3.1 Implicit Markup Hypothesis Validation,[1.0],"['In addition to the presence of a connective, the dialogue structural position of being an initial sentence in a response post did not predict argument quality as we expected.']"

If not stated otherwise the presence of a feature was represented by 1.0 and its absence by 0.0.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
We describe all the handcurated feature sets below.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
Semantic Density Features: Deictic Pronouns (DEI): The presence of anaphoric references are likely to inhibit the interpretation of an utterance.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"These features count the deictic pronouns in the sentence, such as this, that and it.
",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"Sentence Length (SLEN): Short sentences, particularly those under 5 words, are usually hard to interpret without context and complex linguistic processing, such as resolving long distance discourse anaphora.",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"We thus include a single aggregate feature whose value is the number of words.
",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
Word Length (WLEN): Sentences that clearly articulate an argument should generally contain words with a high information content.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"Several studies show that word length is a surprisingly good indicator that outperforms more complex measures, such as rarity (Piantadosi et al., 2011).",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"Thus we include features based on word length, including the min, max, mean and median.",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"We also create a feature whose value is the count of words of lengths 1 to 20 (or longer).
",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"Speciteller (SPTL): We add a single aggregate feature from the result of Speciteller, a tool that assesses the specificity of a sentence in the range of 0 (least specific) to 1 (most specific) (Li and Nenkova, 2015; Louis and Nenkova, 2011).",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]

However they are not domain independent.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]

The feature value was the inverse document frequency of that n-gram over all posts in the entire combined IAC plus CreateDebate corpus.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
Any n-gram seen less than 5 times was not included.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]

"Discourse and Dialogue Features: We expect our features related to the discourse and dialogue hypotheses to be domain independent.

Discourse (DIS): We developed features based on discourse connectives found in the Penn Discourse Treebank as well as a set of additional connectives in our corpus that are related to dialogic discourse and not represented in the PDTB.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
We first determine if a discourse connective is present in the sentence.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"If not, we create a NO CONNECTIVE feature with a value of 1.",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"Otherwise, we identify all connectives that are present.",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"For each of them, we derive a set of specific lexical features and a set of generic aggregate features.
",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
The specific features make use of the lexical (String) and PDTB categories (Category) of the found connectives.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
We start by identifying the connective and whether it started the sentence or not (Location).,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"We then identify the connective’s most likely PDTB category based on the frequencies stated in the PDTB manual and all of its parent categories, for example but → CONTRAST → COMPARISON.",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
The aggregate features only consider how many discourse connectives and if any of them started the sentence.,3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"The templates are:
Specific:{Location}:{String} Specific:{Location}:{Category} Aggregate:{Location}:{Count}
",3.2 Argument Quality Regression,[0],[0]
"For example, the first sentence in Table 8 would generate the following features:
Specific:Starts:but Specific:Starts:Contrast
Specific:Starts:COMPARISON Aggregate:Starts:1 Aggregate:Any:1

We also test the impact of our theoretically motivated features and domain specific features.,4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
The top half of Table 5 shows the RRSE for each feature set with darker cells indicating better performance.,4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
The feature acronyms are described in Sec 3.2.,4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"When training and testing on the same domain, using lexical features leads to the best performance for all topics (SEL, LEX, LNG and SPFC).",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"However, we can obtain good performance on all of the topics without using any lexical information at all (!LNG, WLEN, PNG, and AGG), sometimes close to our best results.",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"Despite the high correlation to the target value, sentence specificity as a single feature does not outperform any other feature sets.",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"In general, we do better for gun control and gay marriage than for death penalty and evolution.",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"Since the length and domain specific words are important features in the trained models, it seems likely that the filtering process made it harder to learn a good function.

We also examine the effect of training set size on performance given the best performing feature sets.,4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
See Fig. 2.,4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"We randomly divided our entire dataset into an 80/20 training/testing split and trained incrementally larger models from the 80% using the default training procedure, which were then applied to the 20% testing data.",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"The plotted points are the mean value of repeating this process 10 times, with the shaded region showing the 95% confidence interval.",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"Although most gains are achieved within 500-750 training examples, all models are still trending downward, suggesting that more training data would be useful.
",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"Finally, our results are actually even better than they appear.",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
"Our primary application requires extracting arguments at the high end of the scale (e.g., those above 0.8 or 0.9), but the bulk of our data is closer to the middle of the scale, so our regressors are conservative in assigning high or low
values.",4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
To demonstrate this point we split the predicted values for each topic into 5 quantiles.,4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
The RMSE for each of the quantiles and domains in Table 6 demonstrates that the lowest RMSE is obtained in the top quantile.,4.2 In-Domain Training,[0],[0]
To investigate whether learned models generalize across domains we also evaluate the performance of training with data from one domain and testing on another.,4.3 Cross-Domain and Domain Adaptation,[1.0],['To investigate whether learned models generalize across domains we also evaluate the performance of training with data from one domain and testing on another.']
The columns labeled CD in Table 7 summarize these results.,4.3 Cross-Domain and Domain Adaptation,[0],[0]
"Although cross domain training does not perform as well as in-domain training, we are able to achieve much better than baseline results between gun control and gay marriage for many of the feature sets and some other minor transferability for the other domains.",4.3 Cross-Domain and Domain Adaptation,[1.0],"['Although cross domain training does not perform as well as in-domain training, we are able to achieve much better than baseline results between gun control and gay marriage for many of the feature sets and some other minor transferability for the other domains.']"

"We then applied Daume’s “frustratingly easy domain adaptation” technique (DA), by transforming the original features into a new augmented feature space where, each feature, is transformed into a general feature and a domain specific feature, source or target, depending on the input domain (Daumé III, 2007).",4.3 Cross-Domain and Domain Adaptation,[0],[0]
"The training data from both the source and target domains are used to train
the model, unlike the cross-domain experiments where only the source data is used.",4.3 Cross-Domain and Domain Adaptation,[0],[0]
"These results are given in the columns labeled DA in Table 7, which are on par with the best in-domain training results, with minor performance degradation on some gay marriage and gun control pairs, and slight improvements on the difficult death penalty and evolution topics.",4.3 Cross-Domain and Domain Adaptation,[0],[0]
"This paper addresses the Argument Extraction task in a framework whose long-term aim is to first extract arguments from online dialogues, and then use them to produce a summary of the different facets of an issue.",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
We have shown that we can find sentences that express clear arguments with RRSE values of .72 for gay marriage and gun control (Table 6) and .93 for death penalty and evolution (Table 8 cross domain with adaptation).,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]

"The two step method that we propose is different than much of the other work on argument mining, either for more formal texts or for social media, primarily because the bulk of previous work takes a supervised approach on a labelled topicspecific dataset (Conrad et al., 2012; Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2014; Ghosh et al., 2014b).",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
Conrad & Wiebe developed a data set for supervised training of an argument mining system on weblogs and news about universal healthcare.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
They separate the task into two components: one component identifies ARGUING SEGMENTS and the second component labels the segments with the relevant ARGUMENT TAGS.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
Our argument extraction phase has the same goals as their first component.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Boltuzic & Snajder also apply a supervised learning approach, producing arguments labelled with a concept similar to what we call FACETS.",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"However they perform what we call argument extraction by hand, eliminating comments from com-
ment streams that they call “spam” (Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2014).",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Ghosh et al. also take a supervised approach, developing techniques for argument mining on online forums about technical topics and applying a theory of argument structure that is based on identifying TARGETS and CALLOUTS, where the callout attacks a target proposition in another speaker’s utterance (Ghosh et al., 2014b).",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"However, their work does not attempt to discover high quality callouts and targets that can be understood out of context like we do.",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"More recent work also attempts to do some aspects of argument mining in an unsupervised way (Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2015; Sobhani et al., 2015).",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"However (Boltuzic and Šnajder, 2015) focus on the argument facet similarity task, using as input a corpus where the arguments have already been extracted.",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"(Sobhani et al., 2015) present an architecture where arguments are first topic-labelled in a semi-supervised way, and then used for stance classification, however this approach treats the whole comment as the extracted argument, rather than attempting to pull out specific focused argument segments as we do here.
",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
A potential criticism of our approach is that we have no way to measure the recall of our argument extraction system.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
However we do not think that this is a serious issue.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Because we are only interested in determining the similarity between phrases that are high quality arguments and thus potential contributors to summaries of a specific facet for a specific topic, we believe that precision is more important than recall at this point in time.",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Also, given the redundancy of the arguments presented over thousands of posts on an issue it seems unlikely we would miss an important facet.",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Finally, a measure of recall applied to the facets of a topic may be irreconcilable with our notion that an argument does not have a limited, enumerable number of facets, and our belief that each facet is subject to judgements of granularity.",5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
