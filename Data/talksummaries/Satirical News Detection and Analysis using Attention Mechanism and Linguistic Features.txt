1	55	However, it is not easy to recognize the satire if the satirical cues are too subtle to be unmasked and the reader lacks the contextual or cultural background.
5	24	It is also concluded that fake news is similar to satirical news via a thorough comparison among true news, fake news, and satirical news (Horne and Adali, 2017).
6	37	This paper focuses on satirical news detection to ensure the trustworthiness of online news and prevent the spreading of potential misleading information.
7	32	Some works tackling fake news and misleading information favor to discover the truth (Xiao et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2016) through knowledge base (Dong et al., 2015) and truthfulness estimation (Ge et al., 2013).
8	28	These approaches may not be feasible for satirical news because there is no ground-truth in the stories.
9	22	Another track of works analyze social network activities (Zhao et al., 2015) to evaluate the spreading information (Gupta et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011).
11	72	Finally, works evaluating culture difference (PérezRosas and Mihalcea, 2014), psycholinguistic features (Ott et al., 2011), and writing styles (Feng et al., 2012) for deception detection are suitable for satirical news detection.
12	42	These works consider features at document level, while we observe that satirical cues are usually located in certain para- 1979 graphs rather than the whole document.
16	34	The paragraph-level features are embedded into attention mechanism for selecting highly attended paragraphs, and the document-level features are incorporated for the final classification.
53	20	We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to encode word representation from characters.
73	25	ui = tanh(Wapi + ba) (5) αi = exp(u>i v a)∑t j=0 exp(u > j va)) (6) d = t∑ i=0 αipi (7) Linguistic features are leveraged to support attending satire paragraph.
76	31	Similar to the paragraph level, we represent document j based on our linguistic feature set and transform it into a high-level feature vector ldj via MLP.
87	24	Writing Stylistic Features: The relative distribution of part-of-speech (POS) tags reflects informative vs. imaginative writing, which contributes to detecting deceptions (Li et al., 2014a; Mukherjee et al., 2013a).
93	21	Different from their work, we use readability metrics, including Flesch Reading Ease (Kincaid et al., 1975), Gunning Fog Index (Gunning, 1952), Automated Readability Index (Senter and Smith, 1967), ColemanLiau Index (Coleman and Liau, 1975), and syllable count per word, as features.
100	26	We exclude these websites in this work because it requires experts to annotate the news articles.
104	21	The true news is collected from major news outlets6 and Google News using FLORIN (Liu et al., 2015).
144	54	We suspect the reason could be the high imbalanced dataset, as an unsupervised learning method for document representation heavily relies on the distribution of the document.
145	97	We report high weighted word-grams in Table 5 based on the SVM model as incorporating word-level attention in our neural hierarchy model reduces the detection performance.
146	23	According to Table 5, we conclude satirical news mimics true news by using news related words, such as “stated” and “reporter”.
155	35	Alternatively, we define the importance of linguistic features by summing the absolute value of the weights if directly connected to the feature.
158	23	We first report the scaled importance of the four linguistic feature sets by averaging the importance of individual linguistic features.
163	24	Within each set, we rank features based on the importance score and report their mean and standard deviation before being scaled in Table 6.
164	23	At paragraph level, we use top three attended paragraphs for calculating.
165	32	The respective p-values of all features in the table are less than 0.01 based on the t-test, indicating satirical news is statistically significantly different from true news.
166	39	Comparing Table 6 and Table 3, we find that the word count, capital letters, and punctuations in true news are larger than in satirical news at the document level, while at paragraph level these features in true news are less than in satirical news.
171	46	The same reason also applies to “Social” and “Leisure”, where the former implies emotional and the latter implies control writing.
191	46	In addition, although satirical news is shorter than true news at the document level, we find satirical news generally contain paragraphs which are more complex than true news at the paragraph level.
192	85	The analysis of individual features reveals that the writing of satirical news tends to be emotional and imaginative.
194	96	We plan to go beyond the binary classification and explore satire degree estimation.
195	28	We will generalize our approach to reveal characteristics of figurative language (Joshi et al., 2016), where different paragraphs or sentences may reflect different degrees of sarcasm, irony, and humor.
