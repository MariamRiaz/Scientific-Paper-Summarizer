123	1	(3.8) can be easily converted into a linear programming form of Eq.
139	1	Consider Ωtot whose true parameter Ωtot∗ satisfies the (IS-Sparsity) assumption.
140	1	Suppose we compute the solution of Eq.
158	2	W-SIMULE: (Singh et al., 2017)Like JEEK, one recent study (Singh et al., 2017) of multi-sGGMs (following ideas from (Wang et al., 2017b)) also assumed that Ω(i) = Ω (i) I + ΩS and incorporated spatial distance knowl- edge in their convex formulation for joint discovery of heterogeneous neural connectivity graphs.

178	1	This has largely extends the previous studies in showing the real-world adaptivity of the proposed formulation.
179	1	JEEK elegantly formulates existing knowledge based on the problem at hand and avoid the need to design knowledge-specific optimization.
183	1	Baselines used in our experiments have been explained in details by Section (5).

203	1	For each simulation case, the computation time for each estimator is the summation of a method’s execution time over all values of λn.
209	2	The ABIDE data aims to understand human brain connectivity and how it reflects neural disorders (Van Essen et al., 2013).
210	1	ABIDE includes two groups of human subjects: autism and control, and therefore we formulate it as K = 2 graph estimation.
214	1	Figure S:2(c) compares JEEK and three baselines: JEEKNK, W-SIMULE and W-SIMULE with no additional knowledge (W-SIMULE-NK).
216	1	JEEK is roughly 7 times faster than the W-SIMULE estimators, locating at the top left region in Figure S:2(c) (higher classification accuracy and lower time cost).
217	8	We also experimented with variations of theW matrix and found the classification results are fairly robust to the variations of W (Section (S:7.4)).
218	24	We propose a novel method, JEEK, to incorporate additional knowledge in estimating multi-sGGMs.
219	202	JEEK achieves the same asymptotic convergence rate as the state-of-the-art.
220	203	Our experiments has showcased using weights for describing pairwise knowledge among brain regions, for shared hub knowledge, for perturbed hub knowledge, for describing group information among nodes (e.g., genes known to be in the same pathway), and for using known interaction edges as the knowledge.
