2	23	One of the most widely used datasets by political scientists is the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) dataset (Volkens et al., 2017), which contains manifestos in various languages, covering over 1000 parties across 50 countries, from elections dating back to 1945.
3	31	In CMP, a subset of the manifestos has been manually annotated at the sentence-level with one of 57 political themes, divided into 7 major categories.1 Such categories capture party positions (FAVORABLE, UNFAVORABLE or NEITHER) on fine-grained policy themes, and are also useful for downstream tasks including calculating manifesto-level (policy-based) left–right position scores (Budge et al., 2001; Lowe et al., 2011; Däubler and Benoit, 2017).
4	31	An example sentence from the Green Party of England and Wales 2015 election manifesto where they take an UNFAVORABLE position on MILITARY is: We would: Ensure that ... less is spent on military research.
8	37	Other than the sentence-level labels, the manifesto text also has a document-level score that quantifies its position on the left–right spectrum.
9	25	Different approaches have been proposed to derive this score, based on alternate definitions of “left–right” (Slapin and Proksch, 2008; Benoit and Laver, 2007; Lo et al., 2013; Däubler and Benoit, 2017).
11	113	RILE is defined as the difference between RIGHT and LEFT positions on (pre-determined) policy themes across sentences in a manifesto (Volkens et al., 2013); for instance, UNFAVORABLE position on MILITARY is categorized as LEFT.
12	21	RILE is popular in CMP in particular, as mapping individual sentences to LEFT/RIGHT/NEUTRAL categories has 1964 been shown to be less sensitive to systematic errors than other sentence-level class sets (Klingemann et al., 2006; Volkens et al., 2013).
14	40	We use the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) (Bakker et al., 2015), which comprises aggregated expert surveys on the ideological position of various political parties.
17	48	We employ a two-level structured model, in which the first level captures the structure within a manifesto, and the second level captures context and temporal dependencies across manifestos.
18	56	Our contributions are as follows: • we employ a hierarchical sequential deep model that encodes the structure in manifesto text for the sentence classification task; • we capture the dependency between the sentence- and document-level tasks, and also utilize additional label structure (categorization into LEFT/RIGHT/NEUTRAL: Volkens et al. (2013)) using a joint-structured model; • we incorporate contextual information (such as political coalitions) and encode temporal dependencies to calibrate the coarse-level manifesto position using probabilistic soft logic (Bach et al., 2015), which we evaluate on the prediction of the RILE index or expert survey party position score.
44	25	The sentence embedding is obtained by concatenating the hidden representations of the sentence-level bi-LSTM, in both the directions, hi = [−→ h i, ←− h i ] , i ∈ [ 1, L ] .
50	47	The RILE score is calculated directly from the sentence labels, based on mapping each label according to its positioning on policy themes, as LEFT, RIGHT and NEUTRAL (Volkens et al., 2013).
55	29	The explicit structured sentence-document loss is given as: Lstruc = 1 |D| |D|∑ d=1 ( 1 Ld ∑ i∈d (piright − pileft )− rd )2 (3) where piright and pileft are the predicted RIGHT and LEFT class probabilities for a sentence si (∈ d), rd is the actual RILE score for the document d, and Ld is the length of each document, d ∈ D. We augment the joint model’s loss function (Equation (2)) with LSP and Lstruc to generate a regularized multi-task loss: LT = LJ + βLSP + γLstruc (4) where β, γ ≥ 0 are hyper-parameters which are, once again, tuned on the development set.
56	24	We refer to the model trained with Equation (2) as “Joint”, and that trained with Equation (4) as “Jointstruc”.
57	21	We leverage party-level information to enforce smoothness and regularity in manifesto positioning on the left–right spectrum (Greene, 2016).
69	50	Each instance of a manifesto and its party affiliation are denoted by the predicates Manifesto and Party.
70	21	Coalition: We model multi-relational networks based on regional coalitions within a given country (RegCoalition),5 and also crosscountry coalitions in the European parliament (EUCoalition).6 We set the scope of interaction between manifestos (x and y) from a country to the same election (SameElec).
76	33	Right–left ratio: For a given manifesto, we compute the ratio of sentences categorized under RIGHT to OTHERS ( # RIGHT# RIGHT+# LEFT+# NEUTRAL ), where the categorization for sentences is obtained using the joint-structured model (Equation (4)).
83	19	These values are then used inside a PSL model for collective probabilistic reasoning, where the first-order logic given in Table 1 is used to define the graphical model (HL-MRF) over the random variables detailed above.
99	26	• HNN : State-of-the-art hierarchical neural network model of Subramanian et al. (2017), based on average embedding representations for sentences and the document.
119	63	In other cases, a subset (say 10%) is randomly sampled for train- ing.
128	21	For the document-level regression task, we also evaluate other approaches based on manifesto similarity and automated scaling with sentence-level policy positions: • Cross-lingual scaling (CLS ): A recent unsupervised approach for crosslingual political speech text scoring (Glavaš et al., 2017b), based on TF-IDF weighed average wordembeddings to represent documents, and a graph constructed using pair-wise document similarity.
129	25	Given two pivot texts (for left and right), label propagation approach is used to position other documents.
136	19	We observed that the coalition-based feature, and polarity of sentences with its position information improves the overall ranking (r, ρ).
137	35	Document similarity based relational feature provides only mild improvement (similarly to Burford et al. (2015)), and temporal dependency provides further improvement against CHES.
139	24	This work has been targeted at both fine- and coarse-grained manifesto text position analysis.
140	79	We have proposed a two-stage approach, where in the first step we use a hierarchical multi-task deep model to handle the sentence- and documentlevel tasks together.
142	40	Since the first step places the manifesto on the left–right spectrum using text only, we leverage context information, such as coalition and temporal dependencies to calibrate the position further using PSL.
143	44	We observed that: (a) a hierarchical bi-LSTM model performs best for the sentence-level classification task, offering a 10% improvement over the state-of-art approach (Subramanian et al., 2017); (b) modeling the document-level task jointly, and also augmenting the structured loss, gives the best performance for the document-level task and also helps the sentence-level task under sparse supervision scenarios; and (c) the inclusion of a calibration step with PSL provides significant gains in performance against both RILE and CHES, in the form of an increase from ρ = 0.42 to 0.61 wrt CHES survey scores.
144	44	There are many possible extensions to this work, including: (a) learning multilingual word embeddings with domain information; and (b) modeling other policy related scores from text, such as “support for EU integration”.
