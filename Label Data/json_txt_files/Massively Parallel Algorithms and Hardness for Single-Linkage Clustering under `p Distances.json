It can be used for hierarchical clustering and is one of the cornerstone techniques in data mining (see e.g. Chapter 17 of a classic text on information retrieval by Manning, Raghavan and Schu\u0308tze (Manning et al., 2008)). Applications of Single-Linkage Clustering include reconstruction of semantic relationships from word embeddings such as Word2Vec (Malak & East, 2016), phylogenetic tree reconstruction (Gower & Ross, 1969), etc.\n1Department of Computer Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States.

Copyright 2018 by the author(s).\nWe consider the problem of constructing a Single-Linkage Clustering for large-scale data. Given a dataset consisting of n real-valued d-dimensional vectors v1, . . . , vn \u2208 Rd the goal of Single-Linkage Clustering is to construct a partition of these vectors into k clusters C1, . . . , Ck such that the smallest distance between two vectors in different clusters is maximized. Formally, for i 6= j let the single-linkage distance between two clusters Ci and Cj under `p distance be dp(Ci, Cj) = minva\u2208Ci,vb\u2208Cj \u2016va \u2212 vb\u2016p where \u2016x\u2016p = ( \u2211 i |xi|p)1/p is the standard p-norm. Then in the k-Single-Linkage Clustering (k-SLC) problem under `p distance we aim to find a partition into k clusters that maximizes mini 6=j dp(Ci, Cj). It is well-known that k-SLC can be constructed from the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the underlying metric by taking as clusters connected components resulting from removal of k\u22121 longest MST edges (see Figure 1 for an example).\nNote that with this approach once the MST is constructed it can be used to compute k-SLC for any value of k. Furthermore, it induces a hierarchical clustering structure that is often desirable in practice. According to Manning, Raghavan and Schu\u0308tze (Manning et al., 2008) the main impediment to this approach in practice that motivates the use of various heuristics is that for large-scale data no practically feasible techniques are currently known for constructing an exact MST. Our work overcomes this challenge by leveraging two observations: 1) inexact but close to optimum solutions can suffice in practice due to the fact that real-valued data always contains rounding errors, 2) while exact MST algorithms are very sequential, approximate solutions can be computed in parallel on a distributed cluster.\nMassively Parallel Algorithms and Hardness for Single-Linkage Clustering under `p Distances m m ac hi ne s\nR Rounds\n\u2264 s bits sent/received\nFigure 2.

Massively parallel computation", "text": "We present analysis of performance of our algorithms in the Massively Parallel Computation model (MPC) which is the most commonly used theoretical model of computation on synchronous large-scale data processing platforms such as MapReduce and Spark. As we demonstrate through experiments in Spark this model accurately reflects performance of our algorithms on real data. MPC model has attracted a lot of interest recently. It has emerged through a sequence of papers (Feldman et al., 2008; Karloff et al., 2010; Goodrich et al., 2011; Beame et al., 2013; Andoni et al., 2014) and has been analyzed extensively (Fish et al., 2015; Roughgarden et al., 2016). While several variations of this basic model exist here we follow the strictest known version of the model used in (Andoni et al., 2014) and hence our algorithmic results hold in other versions as well.\nIn the MPC model we are given access to m identical processors with local RAM space s on each. For an input of size n the total space available to all processors is m \u00b7 s = O\u0303(n). The computation is performed in synchronous rounds. In each round each machine: 1) performs a local computation on its data (under its local space restriction of s), 2) sends and receives messages of total length at most s to other machines which are received before the next round begins1 (see Figure 2). Furthermore, we assume that the most time/space-efficient known algorithm for local subproblems (in our case almost linear-time and space) is used on each machine during the round.\nIn this setup the key complexity measure of performance in such computation is the number of rounds it takes to complete it as other characteristics such as time and communication depend directly on it. The parameter s is set to n\u03b1 for some fixed constant \u03b1 < 1, see (Karloff et al., 2010; Andoni et al., 2014) for more details. In\n1Note that restriction of s on the total length of received messages follows from the local space constraint assuming there is no computation performed on the fly on incoming data.\nthis setting of parameters sorting can be done in O(1) rounds (Goodrich et al., 2011) while sparse graph connectivity takes O(log n)(Rastogi et al., 2013; Kiveris et al., 2014) which is conjectured to be optimal (Karloff et al., 2010; Beame et al., 2013; Rastogi et al., 2013; Roughgarden et al., 2016). It is folklore that an O(log n)-round algorithm for MST in sparse graphs can be obtained via a simulation of Boruvka\u2019s algorithm in MPC. We use these facts extensively in this paper."}, {"heading": "1.3. Our results and previous work", "text": "While scalable algorithms with provable guarantees for other popular clustering methods such as k-means and kmedian are known (Bahmani et al., 2012; Balcan et al., 2013) we are not aware of any such algorithms for SingleLinkage Clustering 2. Also despite the fact that scalable heuristics exist for k-SLC and MST computation for vector data, e.g. (Jin et al., 2015), the only MPC algorithm with provable guarantees in this area that we are aware of is (Andoni et al., 2014)3. For other recent work on geometric data structures and algorithms in the MPC model see (Agarwal et al., 2016; Nath et al., 2016) and results on distributed constructions of coresets (Agarwal et al., 2005; Indyk et al., 2014; Bateni et al., 2014).\nIn (Andoni et al., 2014) it is shown that a (1 + )- approximate MST under `2 can be constructed in O(1) rounds of MPC for constant dimension. However, while the overall cost of the MST is a good approximation to the optimum the length of any given edge can be arbitrarily distorted. This makes it impossible to directly use this algorithm of for the Single-Linkage Clustering problem. For example, consider an input corresponding to a set of points on the line shown in Figure 3 and k = 2. In this case a (1 + )-approximate MST would not necessarily lead to a (1 + )-approximate clustering as any such clustering would have to have clusters {1, . . . , n\u2212 1} and {n} which are at distance 100 from each other. Moreover, the algorithm of (Andoni et al., 2014) will indeed introduce edges of length \u2126( n) into its approximate MST between the first n \u2212 1 points if run on this example. Hence for the MST constructed this way the basic approach of removing the longest edge to obtain a 2-SLC will result in two clusters which are at distance 1 with a very large probability.\n2With the exception of recent work of (Derakhshan et al., 2017) who consider a more general graph metric setting and hence get results which are inherently different from our work as representation of the metric requires \u0398(n2) space\n3For general graph metrics an MST algorithm in MPC is given in (Karloff et al., 2010). In our case using this algorithm directly would imply a quadratic increase in space since our graph is implicitly given by n2 distances between the vectors and hence constructing the graph explicitly is infeasible under the overall space restriction.\nIn this paper we show how to overcome this difficulty and give a different family of algorithms which allow to compute an approximate Single-Linkage Clustering under various distance metrics. While in (Andoni et al., 2014) only `2 metric is considered here we further extend this framework so that it also applies to `1 and `\u221e with similar performance guarantees. Perhaps most interestingly, while an arbitrarily good MST approximation can be computed inO(1) rounds of MPC (for fixed dimension) our algorithms for k-SLC run in O(log n) rounds. As it turns out, such an increase is likely to be necessary. We justify it through a number of hardness results. Our results show that even for k = 2 assuming two most popular conjectures in the MPC literature regarding complexity of sparse connectivity no o(log n)round algorithm can compute k-SLC for sufficiently large dimension of the data with better than some fixed constantfactor approximation that depends on the distance metric used. See Table 1 for a summary of these results4.\nIn order to complete the picture of approximability of kSLC under the most frequently used `p distances we also give algorithms and hardness results under Hamming distance (commonly referred to as `0). In contrast to other distances studied in this paper we are able to completely resolve approximability of the k-SLC problem for constantdimensional data in this case. As we show, there exists an exact algorithm for d = O(1) that runs in O(log n) rounds of MPC while under Conjecture 3.1 no algorithm running in o(log n) rounds can obtain better than 2-approximation even for d = 2. See Table 1 for details."}, {"heading": "1.4. Our techniques", "text": "`1, `2, `\u221e Our algorithms under `1, `2 and `\u221e all share the same high-level structure: we tackle the problem of the input having O(n2) edges by first constructing a sparsifier that only has O(n log n) edges and then run an MST algorithm on this sparsifier. In order to construct a sparsifier we execute a (1+ )-approximate MST algorithmO(log n) times and collect all edges of the MSTs constructed in these executions. We then run an exact O(log n)-round exact MST algorithm on this set of O(n log n) edges and output clusters resulting from removing k\u22121 longest edges of\n4While our algorithms work in the most restricted known version of MPC model, our hardness results also hold in more relaxed versions for which hardness of sparse connectivity is conjectured, see (Roughgarden et al., 2016) for further details. Furthermore, in hardness results for `0 and `1 that require dimension d = \u2126(n) the result holds for O(1)-sparse vectors, i.e. the overall input size is still O(n) words.\nthe resulting MST. Note that the executions of the (1 + )- approximate MST algorithm can be done in parallel and hence it is the second step that introduces O(log n) rounds into the overall complexity of the algorithm. Our algorithms under `1, `2 and `\u221e are given in Section 2. Assuming the same high-level structure this approach is unlikely to be improved as there are no known algorithms for solving MST in sparse graphs in o(log n) rounds.\nHardness In fact, we make the above observation formal by giving reductions from two most popular problems conjectured to require \u2126(log n) rounds in the MPC model: sparse connectivity (Conjecture 3.1) and a stronger \u201cone cycle vs. two cycles\u201d problem (Conjecture 3.2). Our reductions follow the same general strategy \u2013 we introduce a vector vi \u2208 Rn for each vertex in the input graph. This vector is initially set to be ei, the i-th standard unit vector. Then for each edge (i, j) adjacent to the vertex i we update the coordinate j of the vector by adding a carefully chosen value \u03be. This ensures that the for pairs of points which are connected by an edge the distance between their correponding vectors is different from the distance between points which are not connected by an edge. The parameter \u03be is then chosen to maximize the ratio of distances in these two cases. Details are given in Section 3.\n`0 Under `0 (Hamming distance) we can\u2019t construct a (1 + )-approximate MST using (Andoni et al., 2014) and hence our algorithms and hardness results are quite different. Using sorting as a primitive we construct an auxiliary graph and then run an O(log n)-round connectivity algorithm on it d times. This way we obtain an exact MST and hence an exact k-SLC for any value of k. Details are given in Section A. Our hardness reduction in this case is also quite different as we construct a hard instance by creating a set of points in 2D instead of using high-dimensional vectors. Hence our result rules out an o(log n)-round 2- approximation even for d = 2. See Section 3.2 for details."}, {"heading": "1.5.

The largest datasets we used were the SIFT10M and HIGGS datasets from the UCI ML repository which has been used widely in literature (\u2248 11 \u00d7 107). Note that storage of the n2 adjacency would take nearly 960TB of memory and hence building a complete graph locally is infeasible. We observed speedups of several orders of magnitude compared to our benchmark sequential Prim\u2019s algorithm when using 200 reducers. We remark that the speedup is not just due to the parallelism in our algorithm but also due to the use of approximation which is helpful even if the algorithm is executed locally.

As we show below, for `2 these properties hold for the algorithm of (Andoni et al., 2014). Furthermore, in order to extend this approach to `1, `\u221e a more detailed analysis is required.\n2.1. Partition-based algorithm for `1, `2, `\u221e\nTheorem 2.1. For each of the three metrics `1, `2 and `\u221e for any constants 0 < \u03b7 \u2264 3, 0 < \u03b1 < 1/2 such that \u03b7 = \u2126(s 2\u03b1\u22121 2d ) there exists an O(log n)-round MPC algorithm that computes (1+\u03b7)-approximate k-Single-Linkage Clustering for any constant dimension d given as an input set of vectors v1, . . . , vn \u2208 Rd. The algorithm works simultaneously for all values of k under these metrics. The algorithm is randomized and produces correct result with high probability. Given access to machines with RAM space s it uses O\u0303(n/s) machines and time at most O\u0303(s) per round on each machine.\nIn this section we describe a generic partition-based algorithm, Algorithm 2.1, that is used to prove the above theorem. We also give analysis of its approximation guarantee.\nAlgorithm 2.1 relies on (a, b, c)-distance-preserving partitions and uses Algorithm 3 which we describe in Section B.\nWe start by recalling standard definitions of distance preserving hierarchical partitions. Let M(S, \u03c1) be a metric space with distance function \u03c1. For S\u2032 \u2286 S we denote its diameter as \u2206(S\u2032) = supx,y\u2208S\u2032 \u03c1(x, y). A deterministic hierarchical partition P with L levels is defined as a sequence P = (P0, . . . , PL) where PL = {S} and each level P` is a subdivision of P`+1. For a partition Pi we call its parts cells. The diameter at level i is defined as \u2206(Pi) = maxC\u2208Pi \u2206(C). The degree of a cell C \u2208 P` is deg(C) = |{C \u2032 \u2208 P`\u22121 : C \u2032 \u2286 C}|. The degree of a hierarchical partition is the maximum degree of any of its cells. The unique cell at level ` containing a point x is denoted as C`(x). We say that a partition is indexable if this cell can be computed based on x and `. A randomized hierarchical partition is a distribution over deterministic hierarchical partitions. Definition 2.1 (Distance-preserving partition). For parameters a \u2208 (0, 1), b, c \u2208 R+ and \u03b3 > 1 a randomized hierarchical partition P of a metric space with L levels is (a, b, c)-distance-preserving with approximation \u03b3 if the degree of all deterministic partitions in its support is at most c and the following properties are satisfied for \u2206` = \u03b3a L\u2212`\u2206(S):\n1. (Bounded diameter) For every deterministic partition P = (P0, . . . , PL) in the support of P and for all ` \u2208 {0, . . . , L} it holds that \u2206(P`) \u2264 \u2206`. 2.

We think of w as representing weights of edges in a complete graph. Let MSTi(w) denote the weight of the i-th Minimum Spanning Tree edge of this graph sorted in non-decreasing order.\nAlgorithm 2 Partition-based Distributed k-SLC Algorithm Input: vectors v1, . . . , vn \u2208 Rd, parameters \u03b7, \u03b1, p E = \u2205 Set a = s\u2212\u03b1/d, b = poly(d), c = s\u03b1, L = O(log1/a n)\nSet = min (\n\u03b7 6c1Lb , \u03b73c2 ) Repeat O(log n) times sequentially:\nSample partition P with L levels from (a, b, c)-distance-preserving family wP Execute unit step Algorithm 3 for each cell in P with parameter E\u2032 = set of edges output in the previous step E = E \u222a E\u2032\nRun Boruvka\u2019s MST algorithm on E and remove k \u2212 1 longest edges to obtain the clustering.\nLetw+ : S\u00d7S \u2192 R+ be a random family of functions that satisfies that for each x, y it holds that w(x, y) \u2264 w+(x, y) and E[w+(x, y)] \u2264 (1 + \u03b3)w(x, y) for some fixed \u03b3 > 0. Note that the weights given by this random family to different pairs might be correlated with each other. Definition 2.2 (Crossing edge). For a partition (C1, . . . , Ct) of S we say that a pair of points (x, y) crosses this partition if x \u2208 Ci and y \u2208 Cj for i 6= j. Definition 2.3 (Cut-preserving spanning tree). We say that T is an \u03b1-cut-preserving spanning tree for w : S \u00d7 S \u2192 R+ if for every partition (C1, C2) of S there exists an edge in T that crosses this partition and is at most \u03b1 times longer than the shortest such edge with respect to w.\nAs we show below Algorithm 2.1 can be seen as performing the following experiment: draw k functionsw1, . . . , wk i.i.d at random from the family w+. Compute a (1 + \u03b4)cut-preserving spanning tree Ti for each wi. Then for each (x, y) \u2208 S\u00d7S define w\u2032i(x, y) = w(x, y) if (x, y) is in this spanning tree and w\u2032i(x, y) = +\u221e otherwise. Then for all (x, y) \u2208 S \u00d7 S define w\u0304k(x, y) = minki=1 w\u2032i(x, y). The final run of Boruvka\u2019s MST algorithm is then executed on w\u0304k.\nIndeed, random family of functionsw+ satisfying the properties described above is constructed by Algoirthm 2.1 as follows from a result (Andoni et al., 2014) given. It is important to note that cut-preserving spanning tree computations for random function samples from this family required above can be also performed as guaranteed by the following lemma: Lemma 2.2 ((Andoni et al., 2014), Lemmas 3.4 and 3.13). Given access to an (a, b, c)-distance-preserving partition with L levels and approximation \u03b3 for M(S, \u03c1) there exists an MPC algorithm that runs inO(1) rounds and constructs a random family of weight functions wP which satisfies:\n\u03c1(i, j) \u2264 wP (i, j) and E[wP (i, j)] \u2264 (1 + c1 Lb) \u03c1(i, j).\nFurthermore, execution of unit step Algorithm 3 for all cells in this partition for a random function w\u2217 sampled from wP produces a (1 + c2 )-cut-preserving spanning tree T for w\u2217.\nLet w(i, j) = \u2016vi \u2212 vj\u20162, w+ = wP and let \u03b3 = c1 d and \u03b4 = c2 .\nLemma 2.3. Let n = |S|. There is a large enough constant c > 0 such that if k = c log n then for all i it holds that:\nPr w1,...,wk\n[MSTi(w\u0304k) \u2265 (1+2\u03b3)(1+\u03b4)MSTi(w)] \u2264 n\u2212\u2126(1).\nProof. Fix (x, y) \u2208 S \u00d7 S and let \u2206(x, y) = w+(x, y) \u2212 w(x, y). Because \u2206(x, y) \u2265 0 and E[\u2206(x, y)] \u2264 \u03b3w(x, y) with probability at least 1/2 it holds that \u2206(x, y) \u2264 2\u03b3w(x, y) by Markov inequality. If k = c log n then with probability 1 \u2212 1/nc there exists i such that wi(x, y) \u2212 w(x, y) \u2264 2\u03b3w(x, y). By a union bound over all n2 pairs (x, y) with probability 1\u22121/nc\u22122 for each such pair a corresponding index exists. Below we refer to this event as E and condition on it.\nProposition 2.4. Let (C1, . . . , Ct) be an arbitrary partition of S. Let (x\u2217, y\u2217) \u2208 S \u00d7 S be the closest w.r.t w pair of points that belong to different parts of this partition. Then conditioned on the event E there exists a pair of points (x\u2032, y\u2032) that crosses this partition and:\nw(x\u2217, y\u2217) \u2264 w\u0304k(x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(x\u2217, y\u2217).\nProof. First, consider the case when t = 2 and consider any partition (C1, C2) of S. Let (x\u2217, y\u2217) be the shortest edge that crosses this partition, i.e. (x\u2217, y\u2217) := argminx\u2208C1,y\u2208C2 w(x, y). Conditioned on E there exists i such that wi(x\u2217, y\u2217) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)w(x\u2217, y\u2217). Furthermore, there exists an edge (x\u2032, y\u2032) in the (1 + \u03b4)-cutpreserving spanning tree Ti constructed for wi that has length w\u2032i(x \u2032, y\u2032) = wi(x \u2032, y\u2032) \u2264 (1 + \u03b4)wi(x\u2217, y\u2217) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(x\u2217, y\u2217). On the other hand, because wi \u2265 w for every pair (x, y) that crosses the partition (C1, C2) it holds that wi(x, y) \u2265 w(x\u2217, y\u2217). Combining these two facts we conclude that in Ti there exists some edge (x\u2032, y\u2032) that crosses the cut and satisfies w(x\u2217, y\u2217) \u2264 w\u2032i(x\n\u2032, y\u2032) \u2264 (1+2\u03b3)(1+\u03b4)w(x\u2217, y\u2217). By definition of w\u0304k the same holds for it as well, i.e. w(x\u2217, y\u2217) \u2264 w\u0304k(x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(x\u2217, y\u2217).\nNow suppose t > 2. For i = 1, . . . , t define a family of cuts (Si, Ti) where Si = Ci and Ti = \u222aj 6=iCj . Let (x\u2217i , y \u2217 i ) be the shortest pair crossing the cut (Si, Ti). If (x\u2217, y\u2217) is the shortest edge that crosses (C1, . . . , Ct) then we have w(x\u2217, y\u2217) = mini w(x\u2217i , y \u2217 i ). Let i\n\u2217 = argmini w(x \u2217 i , y \u2217 i ). Then using the argument above for t = 2 there exists (x\u2032, y\u2032) such that x\u2032 \u2208 Si\u2217 , y \u2208 Ti\u2217 and:\nw(x\u2217, y\u2217) = w(x\u2217i\u2217 , y \u2217 i\u2217)\n\u2264 w\u0304k(x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(x\u2217i\u2217 , y\u2217i\u2217) = (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(x\u2217, y\u2217).\nGiven Proposition 2.4 the rest of the proof is the same as analysis of approximate Kruskal\u2019s algorithm in (Indyk, 2000), we give the proof here for completeness. Since edges output by Kruskal\u2019s algorithm are produced in the order of non-decreasing weight MSTi is the i-th edge that is output. Consider executions of Kruskal\u2019s algorithm on weights w and w\u0304k. Let the edges output by the former execution be e1, . . . , en\u22121 in order. Let the edges output by the latter execution be e\u20321, . . . , e \u2032 n\u22121.\nTo prove Lemma 2.3 it suffices to show that conditioned on E it holds that w(ei) \u2264 w(e\u2032i) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)w(ei) for all i. The first inequality here essentially follows from the fact that the weight of the i-th MST edge is a monotone function of the weights and w \u2264 w\u0304k.\nThe i-th edge in Kruskal\u2019s algorithm is constructed by joining two closest clusters among n \u2212 i + 1 clusters constructed so far. Let these clusters in the execution of Kruskal\u2019s algorithm on w\u0304k be denoted as C1, . . . , Cn\u2212i+1. The key observation is that there exists an index i\u2217 \u2264 i such that endpoints of the edge ei\u2217 belong to different parts of the partition C1, . . . , Cn\u2212i+1. Indeed, edges e1, . . . , ei form a forest and thus having all such edges be inside C1, . . . , Cn\u2212i+1 would be a contradiction.\nLet (x\u2217, y\u2217) be the closest w.r.t to w pair of points in different parts of the partition C1, . . . , Cn\u2212i+1. By applying Proposition 2.4 to ei\u2217 there exists a pair of points (x\u2032, y\u2032) whose endpoints belong to different parts of the partition C1, . . . , Cn\u2212i+1 and w\u0304k(x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)w(x\u2217, y\u2217). Putting everything together we have:\nw(e\u2032i) \u2264 w\u0304k(e\u2032i) w \u2264 w\u0304k\n\u2264 w\u0304k(x\u2032, y\u2032) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(x\u2217, y\u2217) Proposition 2.4 \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(ei\u2217) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)w(ei)\nThe second inequality follows because e\u2032i is shortest edge w.r.t w\u0304k that crosses (C1, . . . , Cn\u2212i+1). The last inequality follows because i\u2217 \u2264 i, edge weights are non-decreasing.\nPutting everything together we obtain analysis of approximation guaranteed by Algorithm 2.1.\nTheorem 2.5. For \u03b7 \u2264 3 and p = 1, 2,\u221e Algorithm 2.1 constructs a spanning tree forw(i, j) = \u2016vi\u2212vj\u2016p for each t its t-th longest edge (x, y) has weight w(x, y) \u2264 (1 + \u03b7)MSTk(w). This guarantee holds with high probability over the randomness used in Algorithm 2.1.\nProof. Note that takingw+ = wP forw(i, j) = \u2016vi\u2212vj\u2016p where p = 1, 2,\u221e satisfies conditions of Lemma 2.3 by Lemma 2.2. Hence our algorithm constructs a function w\u0304k with properties required for Lemma 2.3. Since c1 Lb \u2264 \u03b7/6 and c2 \u2264 \u03b7/3 we can set \u03b4 = \u03b7/6 and \u03b3 = \u03b7/3 in Lemma 2.3 and hence for \u03b7 \u2264 3:\nPr [E1] \u2265 Pr [E2] \u2265 1\u2212 1\npoly(n) .\nwhere E1 is the event that MSTi(w\u0304k) \u2264 (1 + \u03b7)MSTi(w) and E2 is the event that MSTi(w\u0304k) \u2264 (1 + 2\u03b3)(1 + \u03b4)MSTi(w).\nAfter w\u0304k is constructed by running Boruvka\u2019s algorithm on it we find an MST exactly and hence the approximation guarantee for each of the MST edges follows."}, {"heading": "2.2. Solve-and-Sketch framework and unit step", "text": "We use Solve-and-Sketch (SAS) framework of (Andoni et al., 2014) for computing an approximate minimum spanning tree.

Then SAS algorithm proceeds through L levels, and in level ` a unit step algorithm Au is executed in each cellC of the partition P`, with input the union of the outputs of the unit steps applied to the children of C.

If s = n\u03b1 for a constant \u03b1 < 1 then distinguishing the following two instances requires \u2126(log n) rounds of MPC: 1) a cycle on n vertices, 2) two cycles on n/2 vertices each.\nTheorem 3.3. No o(log n)-round MPC algorithm can achieve approximation for 2-SLC:\n1. Better than ( \u221a 2 + \u221a\n2 \u2212 ) under `2 for d = \u2126(log n/ 2) under Conjecture 3.2. 2. Better than 3 under `1 for O(1)-sparse vectors and d = \u2126(n) under Conjecture 3.2. 3. Better than ( \u221a\n2 \u2212 ) under `2 for d = \u2126(log n/ 2) under Conjecture 3.1. 4. Better than 2 under `1 for O(1)-sparse vectors and d = \u2126(n) under Conjecture 3.1.\nProof. We give proof of Part 1 here, other proofs are similar and are deferred to Appendix E. Given an instance of the \u201cone cycle vs. two cycles problem\u201d we reduce it to the 2-SLC problem as follows:\n1. Create a vector v\u2032i \u2208 Rn for each vertex where v\u2032i = ei and ei is the i-th standard unit vector. 2. For each edge (a, b) in the input graph update the corresponding vectors as v\u2032a = v \u2032 a+\u03beeb and v \u2032 b = v \u2032 b+\u03beea\nwhere \u03be = 1\u221a 2 . 3. Apply Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to v\u20321, . . . , v \u2032 n\nto construct v1, . . . , vn \u2208 Rd where d = O(log n/ 2).\nNote that the above reduction can be performed in only a constant number of MPC rounds. Indeed, Step 1 can be done locally by partitioning vectors between machines and to perform Step 2 we can send each edge (a, b) to the ma-\nchines holding vectors va and vb. For Step 3 note that for each i we have vi = Mv\u2032i where M is the JohnsonLindenstrauss matrix and each v\u2032i has at most 3 non-zero entries. Hence, all vi can be computed in one round of MPC with O(log n/ 2) communication per vector.\nProposition 3.4. If (i, j) is an edge in the input graph then \u2016v\u2032i \u2212 v\u2032j\u20162 = \u221a 2( \u221a 2\u2212 \u221a 2), otherwise \u2016v\u2032i \u2212 v\u2032j\u20162 = 2.\nProof. Indeed, if there is an edge (i, j) in the input then there exist two other edges (i, i\u2032) and (j, j\u2032) and hence, the non-zero entries of v\u2032i and v \u2032 j are as follows: v \u2032 ii = 1, v \u2032 ii\u2032 = \u03be, v\u2032ij = \u03be, v \u2032 jj = 1, v \u2032 jj\u2032 = \u03be, v \u2032 ji = \u03be. Hence \u2016v\u2032i \u2212 v\u2032j\u20162 =\u221a\n2(1\u2212 \u03be)2 + 2\u03be2. On the other hand, if there is no edge (i, j) then there exist four edges (i, i\u2032), (i, i\u2032\u2032), (j, j\u2032) and (j, j\u2032\u2032) and non-zero entries of v\u2032i and v \u2032 j are: v \u2032 ii = 1, v \u2032 ii\u2032 = \u03be, v\u2032ii\u2032\u2032 = \u03be, v \u2032 jj = 1, v \u2032 jj\u2032 = \u03be, v \u2032 jj\u2032\u2032 = \u03be. Hence \u2016v\u2032i \u2212\nv\u2032j\u20162 = \u221a 2 + 4\u03be2. Maximum of the ratio \u221a 2+4\u03be2\u221a 2(1\u2212\u03be)2+2\u03be2 is achieved when \u03be = 1/ \u221a 2 and equals \u221a 2 + \u221a 2.\nBy Proposition 3.4, if the input graph is one cycle then the cost of 2-SLC of v\u20321, . . . , v \u2032 n equals \u221a 2 \u221a 2\u2212 \u221a\n2, otherwise it is 2. As Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform preserves all pairwise distances up to a multiplicative (1 \u00b1 ) factor with high probability the same is true for the cost of 2-SLC of v1, . . . , vn up to \u00b1 error. This completes the proof.\n3.2. Hardness of Hamming k-SLC\nTheorem 3.5. No algorithm for computing Hamming kSLC cost for d = 2 in o(log n) rounds of MPC can achieve better than 2-approximation under Conjecture 3.1.\nProof. Let G(V,E) be an instance of sparse connectivity. Our reduction to Hamming 2-SLC constructs an input set of 2-dimensional vectors as follows: 1) for each vertex i \u2208 V create a vector (i, i), 2) or each edge (i, j) \u2208 E create a vector (i, j). Clearly this reduction can be performed in a constant number of rounds of MPC and the resulting instance has |V |+ |E| = O(n) many vectors. We will show that if the input graph is connected the cost of Hamming 2-SLC of the input equals 1 and the cost is 2 otherwise. Indeed, note that the distances between resulting vectors are always either 1 or 2. If G is connected then it is easy to construct a connected spanning subgraph in the resulting Hamming graph where each edge has cost 1. Indeed, consider a subgraph that for each edge (i, j) in the input graph contains two edges: one between vectors (i, i) and (i, j) and another between vectors (j, j) and (i, j). Clearly, if the input graph is connected then this is a connected spanning subgraph. Hence the Hamming MST cost of the con-\nstructed point set equals |V |+ |E|\u22121 and the Hamming 2- SLC cost equals 1. On the other hand, if G is disconnected then consider any partitioning (S, T ) of G into connected components. Clearly, any two vectors representing vertices belonging to different parts of this partition in our reduction are at distance 2 from each other. This implies that the Hamming MST cost is at least |V |+ |E| and the Hamming 2-SLC cost is 2."}, {"heading": "4.
