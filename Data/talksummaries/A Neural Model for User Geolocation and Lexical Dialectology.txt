0	26	Many services such as web search (Leung et al., 2010), recommender systems (Ho et al., 2012), targeted advertising (Lim and Datta, 2013), and rapid disaster response (Ashktorab et al., 2014) rely on the location of users to personalise information and extract actionable knowledge.
1	51	Explicit user geolocation metadata (e.g. GPS tags, WiFi footprint, IP address) is not usually available to third-party consumers, giving rise to the need for geolocation based on profile data, text content, friendship graphs (Jurgens et al., 2015) or some combination of these (Rahimi et al., 2015b,a).
2	38	The strong geographical bias, most obviously at the language level (e.g. Finland vs. Japan), and more subtly at the dialect level (e.g. in English used in north-west England vs. north-east USA vs. Texas, USA), clearly reflected in language use in social media services such as Twitter, has been used extensively either for geolocation of users (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Roller et al., 2012; Rout et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014; Wing and Baldridge, 2014) or dialectology (Cook et al., 2014; Eisenstein, 2015).
3	9	In these methods, a user is often represented by the concatenation of their tweets, and the geolocation model is trained on a very small percentage of explicitly geotagged tweets, noting the potential biases implicit in geotagged tweets (Pavalanathan and Eisenstein, 2015).
4	23	Lexical dialectology is (in part) the converse of user geolocation (Eisenstein, 2015): given text associated with a variety of regions, the task is to identify terms that are distinctive of particular regions.
6	7	In this paper we propose a text-based geolocation method based on neural networks.
7	27	Our contributions are as follows: (1) we achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark Twitter geolocation datasets; (2) we show that the model is less sensitive to the specific location discretisation method; (3) we release the first broad-coverage dataset for evaluation of lexical dialectology models; (4) we incorporate our text-based model into a network-based model (Rahimi et al., 2015a) and improve the performance utilising both network and text; and (5) we use the model’s embeddings for extraction of local terms and show that it outperforms two baselines.
23	19	These datasets have been used widely for training and evaluation of geolocation models.
25	8	Each user is represented by the concatenation of their tweets, and labeled with the latitude/longitude of the first collected geotagged tweet in the case of GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US, and the centre of the closest city in the case of TWITTER-WORLD.1 GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US cover the continental US, and TWITTER-WORLD covers the whole world, with 9k, 449k and 1.3m users, respectively as shown in Figure 1.2 DAREDS is a dialect-term dataset novel to this research, created from the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) (Cassidy et al., 1985).
29	53	For example, within the Pacific Northwest dialect region, we manually extracted the most populous cities (Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Salem, Eugene) and added those cities to DAREDS as subregions.
31	52	DAREDS is the largest standardised dialectology dataset.
32	16	We use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer as our location classifier, where the input is l2 normalised bag-of-words features for a given user.
34	7	The output is either a k-d tree leaf node or k-means discretisation of real-valued coordinates of training locations, the output of which is visualised for TWITTER-US in Figure 2.
36	17	The number of regions, regularisation strength, hidden layer and mini-batch size are tuned over development data and set to (32, 10−5, 896, 100), (256, 10−6, 2048, 10000) and (930, 10−6, 3720, 10000) for GEOTEXT, TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD, respectively.
38	97	Following Cheng (2010) and Eisenstein (2010), we evaluated the geolocation model using mean and median error in km (“Mean” and “Median” resp.)
40	37	Note that lower numbers are better for Mean and Median, and higher numbers better for Acc@161.
41	32	While the focus of this paper is text-based user geolocation, state-of-the-art results for the three datasets have been achieved with hybrid text+network-based models, where the predictions of the text-based model are fed into a mention network as “dongle” nodes to each user node, providing a personalised geolocation prior for each user (Rahimi et al., 2015a).
42	48	Note that it would, of course, be possible to combine text and network information in a joint deep learning model (Yang et al., 2016; Kipf and Welling, 2016), which we leave to future work (noting that scalability will potentially be a major issue for the larger datasets).
43	61	To test the applicability of the model’s embeddings in dialectology, we created DAREDS.
44	28	The output of the hidden layer of the model is used as embeddings for both location names and dialect terms.
46	27	We also compare the quality of the embeddings with pre-trained word2vec embeddings and the embeddings from the output layer of LR (logistic regression) (Rahimi et al., 2015b) as baselines.
47	15	Regions in DAREDS can be very broad (e.g. SouthWest), meaning that words associated with those locations will be used across a large number GEOTEXT TWITTER-US TWITTER-WORLD Acc@161 Mean Median Acc@161 Mean Median Acc@161 Mean Median TEXT-BASED METHODS Proposed method (MLP + k-d tree) 38 844 389 54 554 120 34 1456 415 Proposed method (MLP + k-means) 40 856 380 55 581 91 36 1417 373 (Rahimi et al., 2015b) (LR) 38 880 397 50 686 159 32 1724 530 (Wing and Baldridge, 2014) (uniform) — — — 49 703 170 32 1714 490 (Wing and Baldridge, 2014) (k-d tree) — — — 48 686 191 31 1669 509 (Melo and Martins, 2015) — — — — 702 208 — 1507 502 (Cha et al., 2015) — 581 425 — — — — — — (Liu and Inkpen, 2015) — — — — 733 377 — — — NETWORK-BASED METHODS (Rahimi et al., 2015a) MADCEL-W 58 586 60 54 705 116 45 2525 279 TEXT+NETWORK-BASED METHODS of cities contained within that region.
48	43	We generate a region-level embedding by simply taking the city names associated with the region, and feeding them as BoW input for LR and MLP and averaging their embeddings for word2vec.
49	17	We evaluate the retrieved terms by computing recall of DAREDS terms existing in TWITTER-US (1071 terms) at k ∈ {0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%} of vocabulary size.
65	21	Equally, some are terms that don’t exist in the DARE dictionary but might be of interest for dialectologists because language use in social media is so dynamic that they won’t be captured by traditional survey-like approaches.
67	8	We proposed a new text geolocation model based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP), and evaluated it over three benchmark Twitter geolocation datasets.
68	12	We achieved state-of-the-art text-based results over all datasets.
69	18	We used the parameters of the hidden layer of the neural network as word and phrase embeddings.
70	75	We performed a nearest neighbour search on a sample of city names and dialect terms, and showed that the embeddings can be used both to discover dialect terms from a geographic area and to find the geographic area a dialect term is spoken.
71	23	To evaluate the geographical embeddings quantitatively, we created DAREDS, a machine-readable version of the DARE dictionary and compared the performance of dialect term retrieval given dialect region name in terms of recall (Figure 4), and compared the performance to the performance in pre-trained word2vec and LR embeddings.
