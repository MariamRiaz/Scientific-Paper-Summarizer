Neural networks have proven to be highly effective at many tasks in natural language.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, neural language models and joint language/translation models improve machine translation quality significantly (Vaswani et al., 2013; Devlin et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, neural networks can be complicated to design and train well.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Many decisions need to be made, and performance can be highly dependent on making them correctly.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Yet the optimal settings are non-obvious and can be laborious to find, often requiring an extensive grid search involving numerous experiments.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we focus on the choice of the sizes of hidden layers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We introduce a method for automatically pruning out hidden layer units, by adding a sparsity-inducing regularizer that encourages units to deactivate if not needed, so that
they can be removed from the network.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus, after training with more units than necessary, a network is produced that has hidden layers correctly sized, saving both time and memory when actually putting the network to use.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Using a neural n-gram language model (Bengio et al., 2003), we are able to show that our novel auto-sizing method is able to learn models that are smaller than models trained without the method, while maintaining nearly the same perplexity.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The method has only a single hyperparameter to adjust (as opposed to adjusting the sizes of each of the hidden layers), and we find that the same setting works consistently well across different training data sizes, vocabulary sizes, and n-gram sizes.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition, we show that incorporating these models into a machine translation decoder still results in large BLEU point improvements.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The result is that fewer experiments are needed to obtain models that perform well and are correctly sized.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Language models are often used in natural language processing tasks involving generation of text.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"For instance, in machine translation, the language model helps to output fluent translations, and in speech recognition, the language model helps to disambiguate among possible utterances.
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Current language models are usually n-gram models, which look at the previous (n− 1) words to predict the nth word in a sequence, based on (smoothed) counts of n-grams collected from training data.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"These models are simple but very effective in improving the performance of natural language systems.
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"However, n-gram models suffer from some limitations, such as data sparsity and memory usage.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"As an alternative, researchers have begun exploring the use of neural networks for language modeling.",2 Background,[1.0],"['As an alternative, researchers have begun exploring the use of neural networks for language modeling.']"
"For modeling n-grams, the most common approach is the feedforward network of Bengio et
908
al. (2003), shown in Figure 1.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Each node represents a unit or “neuron,” which has a real valued activation.",2 Background,[0],[0]
The units are organized into real-vector valued layers.,2 Background,[0],[0]
The activations at each layer are computed as follows.,2 Background,[0],[0]
(We assume n = 3; the generalization is easy.),2 Background,[0],[0]
"The two preceding words, w1, w2, are mapped into lowerdimensional word embeddings,
x1",2 Background,[0],[0]
= A:w1 x2 =,2 Background,[0],[0]
"A:w2
then passed through two hidden layers,
y = f(B1x1 +",2 Background,[0],[0]
B2x2 + b) z,2 Background,[0],[0]
"= f(Cy + c)
where f is an elementwise nonlinear activation (or transfer) function.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Commonly used activation functions are the hyperbolic tangent, logistic function, and rectified linear units, to name a few.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Finally, the result is mapped via a softmax to an output probability distribution,
P (wn | w1 · · ·wn−1) ∝",2 Background,[0],[0]
exp([Dz + d]wn).,2 Background,[0],[0]
"The parameters of the model are A, B1, B2, b, C, c, D, and d, which are learned by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the the training data using stochastic gradient descent (also known as backpropagation) or variants.
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Vaswani et al. (2013) showed that this model, with some improvements, can be used effectively during decoding in machine translation.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we use and extend their implementation.",2 Background,[0],[0]
Our method is focused on the challenge of choosing the number of units in the hidden layers of a feed-forward neural network.,3 Methods,[1.0],['Our method is focused on the challenge of choosing the number of units in the hidden layers of a feed-forward neural network.']
"The networks used for different tasks require different numbers of units, and the layers in a single network also require different numbers of units.",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"Choosing too few units can impair the performance of the network, and choosing too many units can lead to overfitting.",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"It can also slow down computations with the network, which can be a major concern for many applications such as integrating neural language models into a machine translation decoder.
",3 Methods,[0],[0]
Our method starts out with a large number of units in each layer and then jointly trains the network while pruning out individual units when possible.,3 Methods,[1.0],['Our method starts out with a large number of units in each layer and then jointly trains the network while pruning out individual units when possible.']
"The goal is to end up with a trained network
that also has the optimal number of units in each layer.
",3 Methods,[0],[0]
We do this by adding a regularizer to the objective function.,3 Methods,[0],[0]
"For simplicity, consider a single layer without bias, y = f(Wx).",3 Methods,[0],[0]
Let L(W) be the negative log-likelihood of the model.,3 Methods,[0],[0]
"Instead of minimizing L(W) alone, we want to minimize L(W)",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"+ λR(W), where R(W) is a convex regularizer.",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"The `1 norm, R(W) = ‖W‖1 =∑
i,j |Wij |, is a common choice for pushing parameters to zero, which can be useful for preventing overfitting and reducing model size.",3 Methods,[0.9999999944488055],"['The `1 norm, R(W) = ‖W‖1 =∑ i,j |Wij |, is a common choice for pushing parameters to zero, which can be useful for preventing overfitting and reducing model size.']"
"However, we are interested not only in reducing the number of parameters but the number of units.",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"To do this, we need a different regularizer.
",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"We assume activation functions that satisfy f(0) = 0, such as the hyperbolic tangent or rectified linear unit (f(x) = max{0, x}).",3 Methods,[1.0],"['We assume activation functions that satisfy f(0) = 0, such as the hyperbolic tangent or rectified linear unit (f(x) = max{0, x}).']"
"Then, if we push the incoming weights of a unit yi to zero, that is, Wij = 0 for all j (as well as the bias, if any: bi = 0), then yi = f(0) = 0 is independent of the previous layers and contributes nothing to subsequent layers.",3 Methods,[1.0],"['Then, if we push the incoming weights of a unit yi to zero, that is, Wij = 0 for all j (as well as the bias, if any: bi = 0), then yi = f(0) = 0 is independent of the previous layers and contributes nothing to subsequent layers.']"
So the unit can be removed without affecting the network at all.,3 Methods,[1.0],['So the unit can be removed without affecting the network at all.']
"Therefore, we need a regularizer that pushes all the incoming connection weights to a unit together towards zero.
",3 Methods,[0.9999999816224693],"['Therefore, we need a regularizer that pushes all the incoming connection weights to a unit together towards zero.']"
"Here, we experiment with two, the `2,1 norm and the `∞,1 norm.1 The `2,1 norm on a ma-

"(1) (If there are biases bi, they should be included as well.)",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"This puts equal pressure on each row, but within each row, the larger values contribute more, and therefore there is more pressure on larger values towards zero.",3 Methods,[0],[0]
"The `∞,1 norm is
R(W) =",3 Methods,[0],[0]
∑ i ‖Wi:‖∞ = ∑ i max j |Wij |.,3 Methods,[0],[0]
"(2)
Again, this puts equal pressure on each row, but within each row, only the maximum value (or values) matter, and therefore the pressure towards zero is entirely on the maximum value(s).
",3 Methods,[1.0000000640684306],"['(2) Again, this puts equal pressure on each row, but within each row, only the maximum value (or values) matter, and therefore the pressure towards zero is entirely on the maximum value(s).']"
Figure 2 visualizes the sparsity-inducing behavior of the two regularizers on a single row.,3 Methods,[0],[0]
Both have a sharp tip at the origin that encourages all the parameters in a row to become exactly zero.,3 Methods,[0],[0]
"However, this also means that sparsity-inducing regularizers are not differentiable at zero, making gradient-based optimization methods trickier to apply.",4 Optimization,[1.0],"['However, this also means that sparsity-inducing regularizers are not differentiable at zero, making gradient-based optimization methods trickier to apply.']"
"The methods we use are discussed in detail elsewhere (Duchi et al., 2008; Duchi and Singer, 2009); in this section, we include a short description of these methods for completeness.",4 Optimization,[0],[0]
"Most work on learning with regularizers, including this work, can be thought of as instances of the proximal gradient method (Parikh and Boyd, 2014).",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"Our objective function can be split into two parts, a convex and differentiable part (L) and a
convex but non-differentiable part (λR).",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"In proximal gradient descent, we alternate between improving L alone and λR alone.",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
Let u be the parameter values from the previous iteration.,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"We compute new parameter values w using:
v← u− η∇L(u) (3)
w← arg max w",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
( 1 2η ‖w − v‖2 + λR(w) ),4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"(4)
and repeat until convergence.",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
The first update is just a standard gradient descent update on L; the second is known as the proximal operator for λR and in many cases has a closed-form solution.,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"In the rest of this section, we provide some justification for this method, and in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 we show how to compute the proximal operator for the `2 and `∞ norms.
",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
We can think of the gradient descent update (3) on L as follows.,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"Approximate L around u by the tangent plane,
L̄(v) = L(u) +∇L(u)(v − u) (5)
and move v to minimize L̄, but don’t move it too far from u; that is, minimize
F (v) = 1",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
2η ‖v,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"− u‖2 + L̄(v).
",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"Setting partial derivatives to zero, we get
∂F ∂v = 1 η
(v − u) +∇L(u) = 0 v = u− η∇L(u).
",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"By a similar strategy, we can derive the second step (4).",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"Again we want to move w to minimize the objective function, but don’t want to move it too far from u; that is, we want to minimize:
G(w) = 1 2η ‖w",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"− u‖2 + L̄(w) + λR(w).
",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
Note that we have not approximated R by a tangent plane.,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
We can simplify this by substituting in (3).,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"The first term becomes
1 2η ‖w",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
− u‖2 = 1 2η ‖w,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"− v − η∇L(u)‖2
= 1 2η ‖w − v‖2 −∇L(u)(w − v)
+ η
2 ‖∇L(u)‖2
and the second term becomes
L̄(w) = L(u) +∇L(u)(w − u) = L(u) +∇L(u)(w",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"− v − η∇L(u)).
",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"The ∇L(u)(w − v) terms cancel out, and we can ignore terms not involving w, giving
G(w) = 1 2η ‖w",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"− v‖2 + λR(w) + const.
which is minimized by the update (4).",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"Thus, we have split the optimization step into two easier steps: first, do the update for L (3), then do the update for λR (4).",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
The latter can often be done exactly (without approximating R by a tangent plane).,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"We show next how to do this for the `2 and `∞ norms.
4.2 `2 and `2,1 regularization Since the `2,1 norm on matrices (1) is separable into the `2 norm of each row, we can treat each row separately.",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]

G(w) = 1 2η ‖w − v‖2 +",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]

"The minimum is either at w = 0 (the tip of the cone) or where the partial derivatives are zero (Figure 3):

"Clearly, w and v must have the same direction and differ only in magnitude, that is, w = α v‖v‖ .",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"Substituting this into the above equation, we get the solution
α = ‖v‖",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
− ηλ.,4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"Therefore the update is
w = α v ‖v‖
α = max(0, ‖v‖ − ηλ).",4.1 Proximal gradient method,[0],[0]
"As above, since the `∞,1 norm on matrices (2) is separable into the `∞ norm of each row, we can treat each row separately; thus, we want to minimize

Our experiments break down into three parts.,5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"First, we look at the impact of our pruning method on perplexity of a held-out validation set, across a variety of settings.",5 Experiments,[1.0],"['First, we look at the impact of our pruning method on perplexity of a held-out validation set, across a variety of settings.']"
"Second, we take a closer look at how the model evolves through the training process.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, we explore the downstream impact of our method on a statistical phrase-based machine translation system.",5 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We first look at the impact that the `∞,1 regularizer has on the perplexity of our validation set.",5.1 Evaluating perplexity and network size,[1.0],"['We first look at the impact that the `∞,1 regularizer has on the perplexity of our validation set.']"
The main results are shown in Table 1.,5.1 Evaluating perplexity and network size,[0],[0]
"For λ ≤ 0.01, the regularizer seems to have little impact: no hidden units are pruned, and perplexity is also not affected.",5.1 Evaluating perplexity and network size,[0],[0]

Automatically limiting the size of neural networks is an old idea.,6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The “Optimal Brain Damage” (OBD) technique (LeCun et al., 1989) computes a saliency based on the second derivative of the objective function with respect to each parameter.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The parameters are then sorted by saliency, and the lowest-saliency parameters are pruned.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The pruning process is separate from the training process, whereas regularization performs training and pruning simultaneously.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Regularization in neural networks is also an old idea; for example, Nowland and Hinton (1992) mention both `22 and `0 regularization.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our method develops on this idea by using a mixed norm to prune units, rather than parameters.

"Srivastava et al. introduce a method called dropout in which units are directly deactivated at random during training (Srivastava et al., 2014), which induces sparsity in the hidden unit activations.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, at the end of training, all units are reactivated, as the goal of dropout is to reduce overfitting, not to reduce network size.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Thus, dropout and our method seem to be complementary.",6 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We have presented a method for auto-sizing a neural network during training by removing units using a `∞,1 regularizer.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This regularizer drives a unit’s input weights as a group down to zero, allowing the unit to be pruned.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"We can thus prune units out of our network during training with minimal impact to held-out perplexity or downstream performance of a machine translation system.
