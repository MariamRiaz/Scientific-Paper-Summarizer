Neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can memorize their training data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although practitioners have long been aware of this phenomenon, Zhang et al. (2017) recently brought attention to it by showing that standard SGD-based training on AlexNet gets close to zero training error on a modification of the ImageNet dataset even when the labels are randomly permuted.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This leads to an interesting question: If neural nets have sufficient capacity to memorize random training sets why do

they generalize on real data?,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A natural hypothesis is that nets behave differently on real data than on random data.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Arpit et al. (2017) study this question experimentally and show that there are apparent differences in behavior.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"They conclude that generalization and memorization depend not just on the network architecture and optimization procedure but on the dataset itself.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"But what if networks fundamentally do not behave differently on real data than on random data, and, in both cases, are simply memorizing?",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This is a difficult question to explore for two reasons.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, it is hard to provide a direct answer.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Whereas it is easy to tell when a net is memorizing random data (the training error goes to zero!),1. Introduction,[0],[0]
", there is no easy way to tell when a network is memorizing real data as opposed to “learning”.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, and perhaps more importantly, it contradicts the intuitive notion—inherent in the preceding discussion—that memorization and generalization are at odds.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This work attempts to shed light on this second difficulty by investigating the following: How much can you learn if memorization is all you can do?,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Is generalization even possible in this setting?
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"At first, generalization in such a setting of pure memorization may seem hopeless: the simplest way to memorize would be to build a lookup table from the training data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although this approach works for special cases where the input population is finite and small, it fails in general since the examples seen during training are unlikely to match test examples.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
One way to get around this limitation is to use k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or any of its variants at test time.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While k-NNs work well on many problems, they fail on problems where it is not easy to construct a semantically meaningful distance function on the input space.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In such cases, the obvious syntactic distance functions (e.g., say Euclidean distance between images viewed as vectors in Rd) do not work well.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Indeed some of the most interesting results from deep learning have been the discovery—through learning—of semantically meaningful distance functions (via embeddings).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, in this work we do not allow ourselves a distance function.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead, we get around the problem by applying the notion of depth, which has been wildly successful in improving the performance of neural networks, to direct memorization.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We build a network of lookup tables (also
called “luts”) where the luts are arranged in successive layers much like a neural network.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, unlike a neural network, training happens through memorization and does not involve backpropagation, gradient descent, or any explicit search.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Now, since in contrast to a neuron, the function implemented by a lut can be arbitrarily complex, without some means to control the complexity, the notion of depth is vacuous.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We control the complexity of a function learned by a lut in the simplest possible way: we limit the support (and thereby the size) of the lut.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each lut in a layer receives inputs from only a few luts in the previous layer, which are picked at random when the network is constructed.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This kind of restriction on local function complexity is similar to what is found to work well in deep neural networks.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, a convolutional filter is obviously support-limited, and a fully connected layer although not support-limited is nevertheless limited in expressivity.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, the learned weight matrices in neural networks are often sparse or can be made so with no loss in accuracy (Han et al., 2015).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We need two restrictions before we can proceed to an algorithm.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, for simplicity, we focus our attention on binary classification problems.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, because lookup tables work naturally with discrete inputs, in this work we limit ourselves to discrete signals.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In fact, the inputs and all intermediate signals in the network of lookup tables are binary.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The restriction is not as extreme as it may appear.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"There are a number of results in quantized and binary neural networks showing that limited precision is often sufficient (e.g. Rastegari et al., 2016).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, even in real-valued neural networks, we need mechanisms such as convolution and pooling to ensure that certain types of small changes in the inputs (e.g., a small displacement) do not lead to large changes in output.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In principle, similar mechanisms could be used in a fully discrete setting to handle real-valued quantities.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"With these restrictions in place, we are now ready to proceed.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Let B = {0, 1} and consider the problem of learning a function f :",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Bk → B from a list of training examples where each example is an (x, y) pair.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Since we want to learn by memorizing, we construct a lookup table with 2k rows (one for each possible bit pattern p ∈",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Bk that can appear at the input) and two columns y0 and y1.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"The y0 entry for the row corresponding to pattern p (denoted by cp0) counts how many times p is associated with output 0 in the training set, i.e., the number of occurrences of (p, 0) in the training set.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Similarly, the y1 entry for row p (denoted by cp1) counts how many times the pattern p is associated with the output 1 in the training set, i.e., the number of occurrences of (p, 1)
in the training set.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Note that for a pattern p it is possible for both cp0 and cp1 to be greater than zero since due to Bayes error both (p, 0) and (p, 1) may be present in the training examples.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
It is also possible for both cp0 and cp1 to be zero if the input p never appears in the training examples.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"We call such a lookup table a k-input lookup table or a k-lut since the inputs are bit vectors of length k.1
Next, we associate a boolean function f̂ : Bk → B with the lookup table in the following manner:
f̂(p) =  1 if cp1 > cp0,0 if cp1 < cp0, b if cp1 = cp0
where b ∈ B is picked uniformly at random when fixing f̂ in order to break ties.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"In other words, f̂ maps an input p to the output that is most often associated with it in the training set (breaking ties randomly).",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"We say that f̂ is the function learned by the lookup table.
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Example 1.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Let k = 3 and consider learning a function f : B3 → B from 7 examples shown on the left below.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"The lookup table that we learn is shown in the middle, and the truth table of the learned function f̂ is shown on the right.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]

"This is the best we can do on this set of training examples because the Bayes error rate is non-zero.
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"If we measure training error as the average 0–1 loss on the training set, this procedure to learn f̂ has the following properties:
1.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Optimality.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"The learned function f̂ is Bayes-optimal on the training set, i.e., there is no function g :",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Bk → B with training error strictly less than that of f̂ .,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"In particular, the training error is zero iff the training set has zero Bayes error.

Monotonicity.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"If we have more information for each x in the training set, i.e., we augment each training

"The input bit vector (viewed as an integer) can be used to directly index into the table.
example with m extra bits of information (keeping the labels fixed) and use the above procedure to now learn a new function ĝ : Bk+m → B, then the training error of ĝ is no more than that of f̂ .
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Proof Sketch.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
Optimality is easy to see since the total training error is the sum of the training error for each possible pattern p which is minimized by choosing the majority class for each p.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Monotonicity holds since if not, then we can compose the obvious projection Bk+m",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"→ Bk with f̂ to get a contradiction with the optimality of ĝ.
Note that monotonicity implies in particular that the training accuracy at the output of a lut is no worse than that at any of its inputs.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, as we make the luts larger, the training error cannot increase but only decrease.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
This is interesting since there are no restrictions on the m extra bits: they could be completely non-informative.,2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"These properties will prove useful in the next section as we consider networks of luts.
",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"To summarize, the procedure described to learn a single lookup table in this section is essentially memorization in the presence of Bayes error, where the idea is to simply remember the output that is most commonly associated with an input in the training set.",2. A Single Lookup Table,[0],[0]
"Now consider a binary classification task on MNIST (LeCun & Cortes, 2010) of separating the digits ‘0’ through ‘4’ (we map these to the 0 class) from the digits ‘5’ through ‘9’ (the 1 class) where the pixels are 1-bit quantized.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Thus the task is to learn a function f : B28×28 → B. We call this the Binary-MNIST task (overloading binary here to mean both binary classification and binary inputs).
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"In principle, we could use the procedure in Section 2 to learn this function.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"However, since we have only 60,000 training examples in MNIST, most of the 228×28 rows in the lookup table would have 0 entries in both columns, and hence the function learned would be mostly random and have very poor generalization to inputs outside the training set.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"As discussed in the introduction, we get around this problem by introducing depth.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Instead of learning a giant lookup table with 228×28 entries, we learn a network of (much) smaller lookup tables.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The network consists of d layers with each layer l (1 ≤ l ≤ d) having nl k-input lookup tables.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Each lut in first layer (l = 1) receives its inputs from a krandom subset of the network inputs.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
A lut in a layer,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
l > 1 receives inputs from a k-random subset of the luts in layer l − 1.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The connectivity is fixed at network creation time and does not change during training or inference.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The final layer of the network has a single lookup table (i.e., nd = 1) which is the output of the network.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"By analogy with neural
networks, we call the final layer the output layer and the other layers hidden layers.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"We train the lookup tables layer by layer, where the target of each lookup table is the final output.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
We start from the first layer and work our way to the output.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Once a layer has been learned, we use the functions associated with its luts (the f̂s of Section 2) to map its inputs to outputs.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"These outputs serve as the inputs for the next layer, which is learned next.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Continuing our analogy with neural networks, we call the output values of a layer activations.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Inference is similar to training: We start from the inputs and evaluate each layer in order using the functions learned at each lut to map inputs to outputs.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Example 2.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
We modify Example 1.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Instead of learning a single lut with k = 3 inputs, we learn a network of k = 2 luts.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The network shown in Figure 1 has d = 2 layers.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The first layer has 2 luts (i.e., n1 = 2) which are connected to inputs x0 and x1 of the network.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The second layer (which is also the output layer) has 1 lut (i.e., n2 = 1) which is connected to the outputs of the two luts in the first layer.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
(The connections were made randomly when the network was created.),3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Using the procedure in Section 2, the two lookup tables learned in the first layer (using y as the target) along with their corresponding functions f̂10 and f̂11 are:
p x0x1
y0 y1 f̂10
00 1 3 1 01 0 0 1∗ 10 1 0 0 11 1 1 1∗
p x0x2
y0 y1 f̂11
00 1 2 1 01 0 1 1 10 2 1 0 11 0 0 1∗
Let the output of the luts in the first layer be w10 and w11, i.e., w10 = f̂10(x0x1) and w11 = f̂11(x0x2).",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
The learning problem for the lut in the second layer is shown in the tables below.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"For convenience, on the left we show the primary inputs x0, x1 and x2, the first layer activations w10 and w11 (which are the inputs of the lut), and the target output y.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"On the right we show the table and the learned function f̂20:
x x0x1x2
w10w11 y
000 11 0 000 11 1 000 11 1 001 11 1 100 00 0 110 10 0 110 10 1
p w10w11
y0 y1 f̂20
00 1 0 0 01 0 0 1∗ 10 1 1 0∗ 11 1 3 1
In this case the function implemented by the network of 2-luts has the same performance on the training set as the function learned by the 3-lut in Example 1.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"Since there are fewer possible patterns in the case of smaller luts, we expect better pattern coverage during training and hence better generalization.
",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Implementation.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"The memorization procedure described here is linear in the size of the training data, requiring two passes over the training set.",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
It is computationally efficient since it only involves counting and dense table lookups and does not require floating point.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
"It is also easy to parallelize since each lut in a given layer is independent, and the counts can be computed on disjoint subsets of the training data and then combined (using, for example, a reduction tree).",3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Note that using this property it is possible to execute the algorithm on extremely large datasets where all the training examples may not fit on a single machine with only the summary statistics of the data (the counts in the lookup tables) being exchanged across machines.,3. A Network of Lookup Tables,[0],[0]
Experiment 1.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In the first experiment, we apply the above procedure to the Binary-MNIST task (as defined in Section 3) to see if this approach to memorization can generalize.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For this experiment, we construct a network with 5 hidden layers of 1024 luts and 1 lut in the output layer.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We set k = 8, i.e., each lut in the network takes 8 inputs.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The network achieves a training accuracy of 0.89 on this task, which is perhaps not so surprising since we are memorizing the training data after all.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"But what is surprising is that the network achieves an accuracy of 0.87 on a heldout set (the 10,000 test images in MNIST) which indicates generalization.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This result is not state-of-the-art on this variant of MNIST (see Experiment 4), but that is not the point.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"It is significantly above the 0.5 accuracy that would be expected by chance, and this is achieved by an algorithm that only memorizes and performs no explicit search.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The training and test accuracies are stable: there is very little variation from run to run.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In other words, very little depends on the actual random choices made when deciding the topology of the network.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To understand why this is
the case, we look at training accuracies of the luts in the network.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Since the target for each lut in the network is the final classification target, we can examine the accuracy of a lut as a function of its layer.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the accuracies of luts in each layer.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
We observe that as depth increases the average accuracy of the luts in a layer goes up.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In other words, depth helps.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Some intuition for this is provided by the monotonicity property of the luts: the output of a lut cannot have lower accuracy than any of its inputs (Section 2).
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we observe in Table 1 the dispersion in accuracy across the luts (measured either by standard deviation (std) or the difference between max and min) goes down.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Therefore, as depth increases the specifics of the connectivity matters less and the network automatically becomes more stable with respect to the random choices made during construction.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Indeed we can say something stronger: we have seen in our experiments (not shown in Table 1) that as depth increases the activations of the luts in a layer become more correlated with each other, and hence become more interchangeable.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"While this correlation is good for stability with respect to connectivity, it causes diminishing returns with additional depth.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Remark.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The perceptive reader looking at Table 1 will also notice that we are wasting computation: the single output lut in layer 6 receives input from only 8 of the 1024 luts in layer 5 and these in turn can at most receive inputs from 64 luts from layer 4.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Although a different topology would be more computationally efficient, this specific choice allows us to compare the different layers more easily.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We have not optimized this aspect since it typically takes less than 30 seconds using a single threaded unoptimized implementation (Python with NumPy) to run an experiment.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As discussed in the introduction and in Section 3, we do not expect unbridled memorization in the form of a large lookup table (say k = 28 × 28 in the case of Binary-MNIST) to generalize at all.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This motivated our
exploration of a network of smaller lookup tables parameterized by k (the number of inputs of each lut).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
We now vary k to see if we can control the amount of memorization and to see the effect it has on generalization.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To avoid changing too much at once, we keep the number of layers and the number of luts per layer the same as in Experiment 1.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The results are shown in the first 3 columns of Table 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"With small values of k, the network finds it difficult to memorize the training data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As intuitively expected (see also the monotonicity property in Section 2), as k increases the training accuracy goes up with perfect memorization at k = 14, i.e., long before 28×28.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, larger luts generalize less well, and the best test accuracy of 0.90 is achieved at k = 12 though with substantially good memorization of the training data (0.99).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, there is a clear monotonic increase in the generalization gap measured as the difference between training and test accuracy with increasing k.
Experiment 3.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
In this experiment—along the lines of those performed in Zhang et al. (2017)—we randomly permute the labels in the training set and repeat Experiment 2 on this “random” dataset.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The results are shown in columns 4 and 5 of Table 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As expected, with increasing k the network gets better at memorizing the training data, and the test accuracy hovers around chance (0.5) though with significant variation (± 0.05).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This may be viewed as empirical evidence that the Rademacher complexity goes up with k.
However, and this may be surprising for a pure memorization algorithm, memorizing random data turns out to be harder than memorizing real data (columns 2 and 3 of Table 2) in the sense that a larger k is required to get the same accuracy with random data than with real data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For example, it takes until k = 12 to get comparable training accuracy on random data as k = 4 gets on real data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This result corroborates the findings in Arpit et al. (2017, §3 and §4) that real data is easier to fit than random data.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
But it also means that we cannot conclude that any such difference observed in neural networks is because they do not use brute force memorization on real data.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As this experiment shows, such
differences can appear even with brute force memorization.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Finally, at k = 12 we have a network that is able to memorize random data (random training accuracy of 0.82) and yet generalizes to test data when trained on real data (real test accuracy of 0.90).",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is very similar to findings of Zhang et al. (2017) in the context of neural networks.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Kawaguchi et al. (2017, §3) argue that this phenomenon is universal and our result may be viewed as further empirical evidence for their claim showing that this phenomenon can happen even in the simplified setting of just memorization.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 4.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For completeness, we compare memorization with several standard methods and the results are shown in Table 3.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
We have not specifically tuned the other methods since our goal is not to beat the state-of-the-art but to get a sense of how memorization alone does when compared to the standard methods.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The best performance is obtained by a LENET-style convolutional network with 2 convolutions (64 and 32 filters respectively) each followed by a corresponding max pool layer, and 3 fully connected layers (256, 128 and 2 units respectively) with softmax output.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The net is trained for 6 epochs with stochastic gradient descent and dropout.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Once again, compared to random guessing which has 0.50 test accuracy, memorization does quite well with a test accuracy of 0.90 (using the k = 12 configuration from Experiment 2) and beats logistic regression and naı̈ve Bayes.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, 1- and 5-Nearest Neighbors do well too (test accuracy of 0.97) though recall that they are provided with a distance function which memorization does not have access to and must in a sense discover.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 5.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"We now consider the task of separating the i-th digit in MNIST from the j-th digit, which gives us( 10 2 ) = 45 binary classification tasks, which we collectively call Pairwise-MNIST.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The images are binarized as before.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows the training accuracy and the test accuracy for each of those 45 experiments for 8 different values of k.
As in Experiment 2, we find that as k increases, the training accuracy increases (reaching 1.0), but the test accuracy falls off.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"If we look at the best test accuracies for a given task (across k), on 31 out of the 45 tasks, we do better than 0.98.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
The worst of these is 0.95 which is the best memorization can do for separating ‘4’ and ‘9’.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
This is still significantly better than the 0.5 we would expect by chance.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Typically the best test accuracies are achieved at k = 6 and k = 8.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 6.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
In Experiment 5 we notice that the variation is quite high for k = 2.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
This indicates that the depth of the network is insufficient for proper mixing.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"To investigate this further, we keep k = 2 and vary the number of hidden layers from 20 to 25.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Each hidden layer still has 1024 luts.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows how the training and test accuracies vary with the depth of the network.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"It is interesting to note that the test accuracy continues to improve even for relatively deep networks (16 or 32 hidden layers), and we get very high test accuracies even with such small lookup tables.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we note that the variation in the generalization error (difference between training and test accuracies) decreases with increasing depth.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Experiment 7.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
Next we look at memorization on CIFAR-10 which is a collection of 32 pixel by 32 pixel color images belonging to 10 classes.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As with Binary-MNIST, we quantize each color channel to 1 bit and try to separate the classes 0 through 4 from classes 5 through 9.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"This gives us the Binary-CIFAR-10 task where we have to learn a function f : B3×32×32 → B from 50,000 images.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Incidentally, the quantization of each color channel to 1-bit significantly degrades the signal making it a difficult task for humans.
",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For this task, we construct a network with 5 hidden layers each with 1024 luts and one output layer with 1 output.",4. Experiments,[0],[0]
We set k = 10 for the luts.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
This network is able to achieve a training accuracy of 0.79 and a test accuracy of 0.63.,4. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Although not as impressive in absolute terms as the memoriza-

"For the same reason we don’t explore data augmentation here which is a standard technique for CIFAR-10.

"Normalization For the normalization task, we use a total of 44 texts from the Anselm corpus (Dipper and Schultz-Balluff, 2013) of Early New High German.1",2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"The corpus is a collection of manuscripts and prints of the same core text, a religious treatise.",2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"Although the texts are semi-parallel and share some vocabulary, they were written in different time periods (between the 14th and 16th century) as well as different dialectal regions, and show quite diverse spelling characteristics.",2 Datasets,[0],[0]
"For example, the modern German word Frau ‘woman’ can be spelled as fraw/vraw (Me), frawe (N2), frauwe (St), fraüwe (B2), frow (Stu), vrowe (Ka), vorwe (Sa), or vrouwe (B), among others.2
All texts in the Anselm corpus are manually annotated with gold-standard normalizations following guidelines described in Krasselt et al. (2015).",2 Datasets,[0],[0]

"We propose several architectures that are extensions of a base neural network architecture, closely following the sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Sutskever et al. (2014).",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"It consists of the following:
• an embedding layer that maps one-hot input vectors to dense vectors;
• an encoder RNN that transforms the input sequence to an intermediate vector of fixed dimensionality;
• a decoder RNN whose hidden state is initialized with the intermediate vector, and which is fed the output prediction of one timestep as the input for the next one; and
• a final dense layer with a softmax activation which takes the decoder’s output and generates a probability distribution over the output classes at each timestep.
",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"For the encoder/decoder RNNs, we use long short-term memory units (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"LSTMs are designed to allow recurrent networks to better learn long-term dependencies, and have proven advantageous to standard RNNs on many tasks.",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"We found no significant advantage from stacking multiple LSTM layers for our task, so we use the simplest competitive model with only a single LSTM unit for both encoder and decoder.

"By using this encoder–decoder model, we avoid the need to generate explicit alignments between the input and output sequences, which would bring up the question of how to deal with input/output
pairs of different lengths.",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"Another important property is that the model does not start to generate any output until it has seen the full input sequence, which in theory allows it to learn from any part of the input, without being restricted to fixed context windows.",3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
An example illustration of the unrolled network is shown in Fig. 1.,3.1 Base model,[0],[0]
"During training, the encoder inputs are the historical wordforms, while the decoder inputs correspond to the correct modern target wordforms.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"We then train each model by minimizing the crossentropy loss across all output characters; i.e., if y = (y1, ..., yn) is the correct output word (as a list of one-hot vectors of output characters) and ŷ",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"= (ŷ1, ..., ŷn) is the model’s output, we minimize the mean loss−∑ni=1 yi log ŷi over all training samples.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"For the optimization, we use the Adam algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a learning rate of 0.003.
",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"To reduce computational complexity, we also set a maximum word length of 14, and filter all training samples where either the input or output word is longer than 14 characters.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"This only affects 172 samples across the whole dataset, and is only done during training.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"In other words, we evaluate our models across all the test examples.",3.2 Training,[0],[0]
"For prediction, our base model generates output character sequences in a greedy fashion, selecting the character with the highest probability at each timestep.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"This works fairly well, but the greedy approach can yield suboptimal global picks, in which each individual character is sensibly derived from the input, but the overall word is non-
sensical.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"We therefore also experiment with beam search decoding, setting the beam size to 5.
",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"Finally, we also experiment with using a lexical filter during the decoding step.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
"Here, before picking the next 5 most likely characters during beam search, we remove all characters that would lead to a string not covered by the lexicon.",3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]
This is again intended to reduce the occurrence of nonsensical outputs.,3.3 Decoding,[0],[0]

"In our base architecture, we assume that we can decode from a single vector encoding of the input sequence.",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"This is a strong assumption, especially with long input sequences.",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
Attention mechanisms give us more flexibility.,3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"The idea is that instead of encoding the entire input sequence into a fixedlength vector, we allow the decoder to “attend” to different parts of the input character sequence at each time step of the output generation.",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"Importantly, we let the model learn what to attend to based on the input sequence and what it has produced so far.

Our implementation is identical to the decoder with soft attention described by Xu et al. (2015).,3.4 Attention,[0],[0]

We then modify the decoder by conditioning its internal states not only on the previous hidden state ht−1 and the previously predicted output character yt−1, but also on the context vector ẑt:

"In Eq. 3, we follow the traditional LSTM description consisting of input gate it, forget gate ft, output gate ot, cell state ct and hidden state ht, where W and b are trainable parameters.
",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"For all experiments including an attentional decoder, we use a bi-directional encoder, comprised of one LSTM layer that reads the input sequence normally and another LSTM layer that reads it backwards, and attend over the concatenated outputs of these two layers.

"While a precise alignment of input and output sequences is sometimes difficult, most of the time the sequences align in a sequential order, which can be exploited by an attentional component.",3.4 Attention,[0],[0]
"Finally, we introduce a variant of the base architecture, with or without beam search, that does multi-task learning (Caruana, 1993).",3.5 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
"The multitask architecture only differs from the base architecture in having two classifier functions at the outer layer, one for each of our two tasks.",3.5 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]
Our auxiliary task is to predict a sequence of phonemes as the correct pronunciation of an input sequence of graphemes.,3.5 Multi-task learning,[0],[0]

We use word-level accuracy as our evaluation metric.,4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]
"While we also measure character-level metrics, minor differences on character level can cause large differences in downstream applications, so we believe that perfectly matching the output sequences is more useful.",4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]
"Average scores across all 43 texts are presented in Table 1 (see Appendix A for individual scores).

",4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]
"We hypothesize that the reason for this pattern, which is not only observed in the average scores in Table 1, but also quite consistent across the individual results in Appendix A, is that our multi-task learning already learns how to focus attention.

Sample predictions A small selection of predictions from our models is shown in Table 2.,4.1 Word accuracy,[0],[0]

"First, we are interested in the weight parameters of the final layer that transforms the decoder output to class probabilities.",5.1 Model parameters,[0],[0]
"We consider these parameters for our standard encoder-decoder model and compare them to the weights that are learned by the attention and multi-task models, respectively.5

"Next, we compare the effect that employing either an attention mechanism or multi-task learning has on the actual output of our system.",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"We find that out of the 210.9 word errors that the base model produces on average across all test sets (comprising 1,000 tokens each), attention resolves 47.7, while multi-task learning resolves an average of 45.4 errors.",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"Crucially, the overlap of errors that are resolved by both the attention and the MTL model amounts to 27.7 on average.
",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"Attention and multi-task also introduce new errors compared to the base model (26.6 and 29.5 per test set, respectively), and again we can observe a relatively high agreement of the models (11.8 word errors are introduced by both models).
",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]
"Finally, the attention and multi-task models display a word-level agreement of κ=0.834 (Cohen’s kappa), while either of these models is less strongly correlated with the base model (κ=0.817 for attention and κ=0.814 for multi-task learning).",5.2 Final output,[0],[0]

While jointly training the attention mechanism tunes itself to retrieve relevant facts that are required to do the final classification.,3.1 Vanilla Model,[0],[0]
The vanilla model attends over the entire entity/relation space which is not a good approach as we observe that the gradient for each attention value gets saturated easily.,3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"While training the classification and retrieval module together, the model tends to ignore the KG part and gradient propagates only through the classification module.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"This is expected to an extent as the most pertinent information for the task at hand comes from the training samples, only background aiding information comes from KG.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]

"To overcome this problem, we attempted pretraining KG retrieval part separately.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
"A pre-trained KG model is used to retrieve the facts and then concatenate with the classification module, while we allow error to be propagate through the pretrained model, at the time of joint training.",3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]
We infer that KG doesn’t return noise and has essential information for the task as the separate KG part alone shows significant performance (59% for News20 & 66% for SNLI).,3.2 Pre-training KG Retrieval,[0],[0]

Each of the clusters were then encoded using convolutional filters.,3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]

Similar procedure of clustering followed by the encoding of the cluster entities is done for relations as well.,3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"Thus both the entity and relation space were reduced to contain fewer elements, one each for each cluster.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"After the compact entity space E and relation space R is formed, we followed the same steps as earlier for forming the attention, but now the training was more effective as the gradient was propagating effectively and was not choked by the large space.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"As the convolution architecture is also simultaneously trained, attention mechanism was not burdened as before, to learn over the large space of entities and relations.
",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]
"Another point that needs to be mentioned here is regarding ranking/ordering items in the clusters, we have done experiments to verify the ordering does not affect the final result.",3.3 Convolution-based Entity and Relation Cluster Representation,[0],[0]

Our experiments were designed to analyze whether a deep learning model is being improved when it has access to KG facts from a relevant source.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"The selection of knowledge graph has to be pertinent to the task at hand, as currently there is no single knowledge base that contains multiple kinds of information and can cater to all tasks.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
We illustrate with results that the performance of a deep learning model improves when it has access to relevant facts.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"We also illustrate that as the model learns faster with access to knowledge bases, we can train deep learning models with substantially less training data, without compromising on the accuracy.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"In the subsequent section we briefly describe the datasets and associated Knowledge Bases used.
Datasets and Relevant Knowledge Graphs
In our experiments, we have mainly used the popular text classification dataset 20Newsgroups (Lichman, 2013) and the Natural Language Inference dataset, Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (Bowman et al., 2015).",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"We have also done experiments on DBPedia ontology classification dataset1, with a very strong baseline.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"These datasets are chosen as they share domain knowledge with two most popular knowledge bases, Freebase (FB15k) (Bollacker et al., 2008) and WordNet (WN18) (Bordes et al., 2013).",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"The training and test size of the datasets are mentioned in Table 1.
1http://wiki.dbpedia.org/ services-resources/dbpedia-data-set-2014
Freebase (FB15k) (Bollacker et al., 2008) contains facts about people, places and things (contains 14904 entities, 1345 relations & 4.9M fact triples), which is useful for text classification in 20Newsgroups (Lichman, 2013) dataset.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, WordNet (WN18) (Bordes et al., 2013) (has 40943 entities, 18 relations & 1.5M fact triples) contains facts about common day-to-day things (example: furniture includes bed), which can help in inference tasks like SNLI.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"Both the knowledge bases are directed graphs, due to fewer number of relations WN18 the entities are more likely to be connected using the same type of relations.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
For experiments relating to both the datasets 20Newsgroups & SNLI we used the standard LSTM as the classification module.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
"As iterated earlier, our KG based fact retrieval is independent of the base model used.",4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
We show improvement in performance using the proposed models by KG fact retrieval.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
We use classification accuracy of the test set as our evaluation metric.,4 Experiments and Evaluations,[0],[0]
All experiments were carried on a Dell Precision Tower 7910 server with Quadro M5000 GPU with 8 GB of memory.,4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The models were trained using the Adam’s Optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) in a stochastic gradient descent (Bottou, 2012) fashion.",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The models were implemented using TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015).",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The relevant hyperparameters are listed in Table 2.,4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The word embeddings for the experiments were obtained using the pre-trained GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)2 vectors.",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"For words missing in the pre-trained vectors, the local GloVe vectors which was trained on the corresponding dataset was used.",4.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows the results of test accuracy of the various methods proposed on the datasets News20 & SNLI.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]

not getting trained effectively.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
The convolutionbased model shows significant improvement over the normal LSTM classification.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
While tuning the parameters of the convolution for clustered entities/relations it was observed that smaller stride length and longer max-pool window improved performance.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"For News20 dataset we show an improvement of almost 3% and for SNLI an improvement of almost 5%.
",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
The work is motivated more from the perspective of whether incorporation of world knowledge will improve any deep learning model rather than beating the state-of-the-art performance.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"Although LSTM is used to encode the input for the model as well as the retrieval vector, as mentioned earlier, these two modules need not be same.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
For encoding the input any complex state-of-the-art model can be used.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
LSTM has also been used to generate the retrieval vector.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"For DBPedia ontology classification dataset, we have used a strong baseline of 98.6%, and after augmenting it with KG (Freebase) using convolution based model we saw an improvement of ∼0.2%.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"As the baseline is stronger, the improvement quantum has decreased.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
This is quite intuitive as complex models are selfsufficient in learning from the data by itself and therefore the room available for further improvement is relatively less.,4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"The improvement as observed in the experiments is significant in weaker learning models, however it is also capable of improving stronger baselines as is evident from the results of DBPedia dataset.",4.2 Results & Discussion,[0],[0]
"We hypothesized that as Knowledge Graph is feeding more information to the model, we can achieve better performance with less training data.
",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
To verify this we have performed experiments on varying dataset fractions for 20Newsgroups dataset as shown in Figure 5.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"From the plot, we observe that KG augmented LSTM with 70% data outperforms the baseline model with full dataset support, thereby reducing the dependency on labeled data by 30%.
",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
We also designed an experiment to compare the accuracy of the baseline model trained on full training data and compared it with the accuracy of the KG augmented model trained with just 70% of the training data for 20Newsgroups and SNLI datasets.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
The accuracy and training loss plots across training epochs is given in Figure 6.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"Even with just 70% of the data, KG augmented model is able to achieve better accuracy compared to the vanilla LSTM model trained on the full data.",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
This clearly indicates that relevant information pertaining to the task is retrieved from the knowledge graph and the training loss reduction is not due to lesser data only.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
Also note that training loss is substantially less for KG LSTM compared to normal LSTM when the dataset size is reduced.,4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"This result is very promising, to reduce the large labeled training data requirement of large deep learning
models, which is hard to come by.",4.3 Reducing Dataset Size Requirements for Training Deep Learning Models,[0],[0]
"The basic idea of infusing general world knowledge for learning tasks, especially for natural language processing, has not been attempted before.",5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]

In Transfer Learning the focus is on training the model for one task and tuning the trained model to use it for another task.,5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]
This is heavily dependent on the alignment between source task and destination task and transferred information is in the model.,5 Relevant Previous Work,[0],[0]

A more sophisticated model which is able to retrieve facts more efficiently from millions of entries can be formulated.,6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]
"Currently we have focused only on a flat attention structure, a hierarchical attention mechanism would be more suitable.",6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]
The model uses soft attention to enable training by simple stochastic gradient descent.,6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]
Hard attention over facts using reinforcement learning can be pursued further.,6 Conclusion & Future Work,[0],[0]

Multilingual word embeddings have attracted a lot of attention in recent times.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to having a direct application in inherently crosslingual tasks like machine translation (Zou et al., 2013) and crosslingual entity linking (Tsai and Roth, 2016), they provide an excellent mechanism for transfer learning, where a model trained in a resource-rich language is transferred to a less-resourced one, as shown with part-of-speech tagging (Zhang et al., 2016), parsing (Xiao and Guo, 2014) and document classification (Klementiev et al., 2012).

"Most methods to learn these multilingual word embeddings make use of large parallel corpora (Gouws et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015), but there have been several proposals to relax this requirement, given its scarcity in most language pairs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A possible relaxation is to use document-aligned or label-aligned comparable corpora (Søgaard et al.,
2015; Vulić and Moens, 2016; Mogadala and Rettinger, 2016), but large amounts of such corpora are not always available for some language pairs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An alternative approach that we follow here is to independently train the embeddings for each language on monolingual corpora, and then learn a linear transformation to map the embeddings from one space into the other by minimizing the distances in a bilingual dictionary, usually in the range of a few thousand entries (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Artetxe et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, dictionaries of that size are not readily available for many language pairs, specially those involving less-resourced languages.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we reduce the need of large bilingual dictionaries to much smaller seed dictionaries.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our method can work with as little as 25 word pairs, which are straightforward to obtain assuming some basic knowledge of the languages involved.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The method can also work with trivially generated seed dictionaries of numerals (i.e. 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4...) making it possible to learn bilingual word embeddings without any real bilingual data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In either case, we obtain very competitive results, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods that make use of much richer bilingual resources.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The proposed method is an extension of existing mapping techniques, where the dictionary is used to learn the embedding mapping and the embedding mapping is used to induce a new dictionary iteratively in a self-learning fashion (see Figure 1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"A prominent application of bilingual embedding mappings, with a direct application in machine translation (Zhao et al., 2015), is bilingual lexicon extraction, which is also the main evaluation method.",2.1 Bilingual embedding mappings,[0],[0]
"More specifically, the learned mapping is used to induce the translation of source language words that were missing in the original dictionary, usually by taking their nearest neighbor word in the target language according to cosine similarity, although Dinu et al.

A practical aspect for reducing the need of bilingual supervision is on the design of the seed dictionary.,2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]
"This is analyzed in depth by Vulić and Korhonen (2016), who propose using documentaligned corpora to extract the training dictionary.",2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]

"The former uses adversarial autoencoders (Makhzani et al., 2016), combining an encoder that maps the source language embeddings into the target language, a decoder that reconstructs the original embeddings, and a discriminator that distinguishes mapped embeddings from real target language embeddings, whereas the latter adds a regularization term to the training of word embeddings that pushes the mean and variance of each dimension in different languages close to each other.",2.2 Unsupervised and weakly supervised bilingual embeddings,[0],[0]

Our method can be combined with any embedding mapping and dictionary induction technique (see Section 2.1).,3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"However, efficiency turns out to be critical for a variety of reasons.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"First of all, by enclosing the learning logic in a loop, the total training time is increased by the number of iterations.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"Even more importantly, our framework requires to explicitly build the entire dictionary at each iteration, whereas previous work tends to induce the translation of individual words ondemand later at runtime.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"Moreover, from the second iteration onwards, it is this induced, full dictionary that has to be used to learn the embedding mapping, and not the considerably smaller seed dictionary as it is typically done.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"In the following two subsections, we respectively describe the embedding mapping method and the dictionary in-
duction method that we adopt in our work with these efficiency requirements in mind.",3 Proposed self-learning framework,[0],[0]
"As discussed in Section 2.1, most previous methods to learn embedding mappings use variants of gradient descent.",3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
"Among the more efficient exact alternatives, we decide to adopt the one by Artetxe et al. (2016) for its simplicity and good results as reported in their paper.",3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
"We next present their method, adapting the formalization to explicitly incorporate the dictionary as required by our self-learning algorithm.
",3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
Let X and Z denote the word embedding matrices in two languages so that Xi∗ corresponds to the ith source language word embedding and Zj∗ corresponds to the jth target language embedding.,3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
"While Artetxe et al. (2016) assume these two matrices are aligned according to the dictionary, we drop this assumption and represent the dictionary explicitly as a binary matrix D, so that Dij = 1 if the ith source language word is aligned with the jth target language word.",3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
The goal is then to find the optimal mapping matrix W ∗ so that the sum of squared Euclidean distances between the mapped source embeddings Xi∗W and target embeddings Zj∗,3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]

Following Artetxe et al. (2016), we length normalize and mean center the embedding matrices X and Z in a preprocessing step, and constrain W to be an orthogonal matrix (i.e. WW T = W TW = I), which serves to enforce monolingual invariance, preventing a degradation in monolingual performance while yielding to better bilingual mappings.",3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
"Under such orthogonality constraint, minimizing the squared Euclidean distance becomes equivalent to maximizing the dot product, so the above optimization objective can be reformulated as follows:

"Since the dictionary matrix D is sparse, this can be efficiently computed in linear time with respect to the number of dictionary entries.",3.1 Embedding mapping,[0],[0]
"As discussed in Section 2.1, practically all previous work uses nearest neighbor retrieval for word translation induction based on embedding mappings.",3.2 Dictionary induction,[0],[0]
"In nearest neighbor retrieval, each source language word is assigned the closest word in the target language.",3.2 Dictionary induction,[0],[0]
"In our work, we use the dot product between the mapped source language embeddings and the target language embeddings as the similarity measure, which is roughly equivalent to cosine similarity given that we apply length normalization followed by mean centering as a preprocessing step (see Section 3.1).",3.2 Dictionary induction,[0],[0]

"Dij = 0 otherwise1.

"While we find that independently computing the similarity measure between all word pairs is prohibitively slow, the computation of the entire similarity matrix XWZT can be easily vectorized using popular linear algebra libraries, obtaining big performance gains.",3.2 Dictionary induction,[0],[0]
"However, the resulting similarity matrix is often too large to fit in memory when using large vocabularies.",3.2 Dictionary induction,[0],[0]
"For that reason, instead of computing the entire similarity matrix XWZT in a single step, we iteratively compute submatrices of it using vectorized matrix multiplication, find their corresponding maxima each time, and then combine the results.",3.2 Dictionary induction,[0],[0]
"In this section, we experimentally test the proposed method in bilingual lexicon induction and crosslingual word similarity.",4 Experiments and results,[0],[0]

"The embeddings were trained with the word2vec toolkit with CBOW and negative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2013b)3, using a 2.8 billion word corpus for English (ukWaC + Wikipedia + BNC) and a 1.6 billion word corpus for Italian (itWaC).",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"The training and test sets were derived from a dictionary built form Europarl word alignments and available at OPUS (Tiedemann, 2012), taking 1,500 random entries uniformly distributed in 5 frequency bins as the test set and the 5,000 most frequent of the remaining word pairs as the training set.
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In addition to English-Italian, we selected two other languages from different language families with publicly available resources.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
We thus created analogous datasets for English-German and English-Finnish.,4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In the case of German, the embeddings were trained on the 0.9 billion word corpus SdeWaC, which is part of the WaCky collection (Baroni et al., 2009) that was also used for English and Italian.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"Given that Finnish is not included in this collection, we used the 2.8 billion word Common Crawl corpus provided at WMT 20164 instead, which we tokenized using the Stanford Tokenizer (Manning et al., 2014).",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, we created training and test sets for both pairs from their respective Europarl dictionaries from OPUS following the exact same procedure used for English-Italian, and the word embeddings were also trained using the same configuration as Dinu et al. (2015).
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"Given that the main focus of our work is on small seed dictionaries, we created random subsets of 2,500, 1,000, 500, 250, 100, 75, 50 and 25 entries from the original training dictionaries of 5,000 entries.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"This was done by shuffling once the training dictionaries and taking their first k entries, so it is guaranteed that each dictionary is a strict subset of the bigger dictionaries.
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, we explored using automatically generated dictionaries as a shortcut to practical unsupervised learning.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"For that purpose, we created numeral dictionaries, consisting of words matching the [0-9]+ regular expression in both vocabularies (e.g. 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 1992-1992

3The context window was set to 5 words, the dimension of the embeddings to 300, the sub-sampling to 1e-05 and the number of negative samples to 10, and the vocabulary was restricted to the 200,000 most frequent words

etc.).",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"The resulting dictionary had 2772 entries for English-Italian, 2148 for English-German, and 2345 for English-Finnish.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"While more sophisticated approaches are possible (e.g. involving the edit distance of all words), we believe that this method is general enough that should work with practically any language pair, as Arabic numerals are often used even in languages with a different writing system (e.g. Chinese and Russian).
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"While bilingual lexicon induction is a standard evaluation task for seed dictionary based methods like ours, it is unsuitable for bilingual corpus based methods, as statistical word alignment already provides a reliable way to derive dictionaries from bilingual corpora and, in fact, this is how the test dictionary itself is built in our case.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"For that reason, we carried out some experiments in crosslingual word similarity as a way to test our method in a different task and allowing to compare it to systems that use richer bilingual data.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"There are no many crosslingual word similarity datasets, and we used the RG-65 and WordSim353 crosslingual datasets for English-German and the WordSim-353 crosslingual dataset for EnglishItalian as published by Camacho-Collados et al. (2015) 5.
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"As for the convergence criterion, we decide to stop training when the improvement on the average dot product for the induced dictionary falls below a given threshold from one iteration to the next.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"After length normalization, the dot product ranges from -1 to 1, so we decide to set this threshold at 1e-6, which we find to be a very conservative value yet enough that training takes a reasonable amount of time.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"The curves in the next section confirm that this was a reasonable choice.
",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"This convergence criterion is usually met in less than 100 iterations, each of them taking 5 minutes on a modest desktop computer (Intel Core i5-4670 CPU with 8GiB of RAM), including the induction of a dictionary of 200,000 words at each iteration.",4.1 Experimental settings,[0],[0]
"For the experiments on bilingual lexicon induction, we compared our method with those proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013a), Xing et al. (2015), Zhang et al. (2016) and Artetxe et al. (2016), all of them implemented as part of the framework proposed by the latter.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]

",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"The results for the 5,000 entry dictionaries show that our method is comparable or even better than the other systems.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"As another reference, the best published results using nearest-neighbor retrieval are due to Lazaridou et al. (2015), who report an accuracy of 40.20% for the full EnglishItalian dictionary, almost at pair with our system (39.67%).
",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In any case, the main focus of our work is on smaller dictionaries, and it is under this setting that our method really stands out.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"The 25 entry and numerals columns in Table 1 show the results for this setting, where all previous methods drop dramatically, falling below 1% accuracy in all cases.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"The method by Zhang et al. (2016) also obtains poor results with small dictionaries, which reinforces our hypothesis in Section 2.2 that their method can only capture coarse-grain bilingual relations for small dictionaries.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, our proposed method obtains very competitive results for all dictionaries, with a difference of only 1-2 points between the full dictionary and both the 25 entry dictionary and the numerals dictionary in all three languages.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"Figure 2 shows the curve of the English-Italian accuracy for different seed dictionary sizes, confirming this trend.
",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"Finally, it is worth mentioning that, even if all the three language pairs show the same general behavior, there are clear differences in their absolute accuracy numbers, which can be attributed to the linguistic proximity of the languages involved.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In particular, the results for English-Finnish are about 10 points below the rest, which is explained by the fact that Finnish is a non-indoeuropean agglutinative language, making the task considerably more difficult for this language pair.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In this regard, we believe that the good results with small dictionaries are a strong indication of the robustness of our method, showing that it is able to learn good bilingual mappings from very little bilingual ev-
idence even for distant language pairs where the structural similarity of the embedding spaces is presumably weaker.",4.2 Bilingual lexicon induction,[0],[0]
"In addition to the baseline systems in Section 4.2, in the crosslingual similarity experiments we also tested the method by Luong et al. (2015), which is the state-of-the-art for bilingual word embeddings based on parallel corpora (Upadhyay et al., 2016)6.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"As this method is an extension of word2vec, we used the same hyperparameters as for the monolingual embeddings when possible (see Section 4.1), and leave the default ones otherwise.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"We used Europarl as our parallel corpus to train this method as done by the authors, which consists of nearly 2 million parallel sentences.
",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"As shown in the results in Table 2, our method obtains the best results in all cases, surpassing the rest of the dictionary-based methods by 1-3 points depending on the dataset.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"But, most importantly, it does not suffer from any significant degradation for using smaller dictionaries and, in fact, our method gets better results using the 25 entry dictionary or the numeral list as the only bilingual evidence than any of the baseline systems using much richer resources.
",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"The relatively poor results of Luong et al. (2015) can be attributed to the fact that the dictionary based methods make use of much bigger monolingual corpora, while methods based on parallel corpora are restricted to smaller corpora.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"However, it is not clear how to introduce monolingual corpora on those methods.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]
"We did run some experiments with BilBOWA (Gouws et al., 2015), which supports training in monolingual corpora in addition to bilingual corpora, but obtained very poor results7.",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]

6We also tested English-German pre-trained embeddings from Klementiev et al. (2012) and Chandar A P et al. (2014).",4.3 Crosslingual word similarity,[0],[0]

"It might seem somehow surprising at first that, as seen in the previous section, our simple selflearning approach is able to learn high quality bilingual embeddings from small seed dictionaries instead of falling in degenerated solutions.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"In this section, we try to shed light on our approach, and give empirical evidence supporting our claim.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]

Contrary to the optimization objective for W in Section 3.1, the global optimization objective does not refer to any dictionary, and maximizes the similarity between each source language word and its closest target language word.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, a random solution would map source language embeddings to seemingly random locations in the target language space, and it would thus be unlikely that

"8While we restrict our formal analysis to the embedding mapping and dictionary induction method that we use, the general reasoning should be valid for other choices as well.

"they have any target language word nearby, making the optimization value small.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"In contrast, a good solution would map source language words close to their translation equivalents in the target language space, and they would thus have their corresponding embeddings nearby, making the optimization value large.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"While it is certainly possible to build degenerated solutions that take high optimization values for small subsets of the vocabulary, we think that the structural similarity between independently trained embedding spaces in different languages is strong enough that optimizing this function yields to meaningful bilingual mappings when the size of the vocabulary is much larger than the dimensionality of the embeddings.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
The reasoning for how the self-learning framework is optimizing this objective is as follows.,5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"At the end of each iteration, the dictionary D is updated to assign, for the current mapping W , each source language word to its closest target language word.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"This way, when we update W to maximize the average similarity of these dictionary entries at the beginning of the next iteration, it is guaranteed that the value of the optimization objective will improve (or at least remain the same).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"The reason is that the average similarity between each word and what were previously the closest words will be improved if possible, as this is what the updated W directly optimizes (see Section 3.1).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, it is also possible that, for some source words, some other target words get closer after the update.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"Thanks to this, our self-learning algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum of the above global objective, behaving like an alternating optimization algorithm for it.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"It is interesting to note that the above reasoning is valid no matter what the the initial solution is, and, in fact, the global optimization objective does not depend on the seed dictionary nor any other
bilingual resource.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"For that reason, it should be possible to use a random initialization instead of a small seed dictionary.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"However, we empirically observe that this works poorly in practice, as our algorithm tends to get stuck in poor local optima when the initial solution is not good enough.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"The general behavior of our method is reflected in Figure 3, which shows the learning curve for different seed dictionaries according to both the objective function and the accuracy on bilingual lexicon induction.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"As it can be seen, the objective function is improved from iteration to iteration and converges to a local optimum just as expected.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"At the same time, the learning curves show a strong correlation between the optimization objective and the accuracy, as it can be clearly observed that improving the former leads to an improvement of the latter, confirming our explanations.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"Regarding random initialization, the figure shows that the algorithm gets stuck in a poor local optimum of the objective function, which is the reason of the bad performance (0% accuracy) on bilingual lexicon induction, but the proposed optimization objective itself seems to be adequate.
",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"Finally, we empirically observe that our algorithm learns similar mappings no matter what the seed dictionary was.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"We first repeated our experiments on English-Italian bilingual lexicon induction for 5 different dictionaries of 25 entries, obtaining an average accuracy of 38.15% and a standard deviation of only 0.75%.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"In addition to that, we observe that the overlap between the predictions made when starting with the full dictionary and the numerals dictionary is 76.00% (60.00% for the 25 entry dictionary).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"At the same time,
37.00% of the test cases are correctly solved by both instances, and it is only 5.07% of the test cases that one of them gets right and the other wrong (34.00% and 8.94% for the 25 entry dictionary).",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"This suggests that our algorithm tends to converge to similar solutions even for disjoint seed dictionaries, which is in line with our view that we are implicitly optimizing an objective that is independent from the seed dictionary, yet a seed dictionary is necessary to build a good enough initial solution to avoid getting stuck in poor local optima.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"For that reason, it is likely that better methods to tackle this optimization problem would allow learning bilingual word embeddings without any bilingual evidence at all and, in this regard, we believe that our work opens exciting opportunities for future research.",5 Global optimization objective,[0],[0]
"So as to better understand the behavior of our system, we performed an error analysis of its output in English-Italian bilingual lexicon induction when starting with the 5,000 entry, the 25 entry and the numeral dictionaries in comparison with the baseline method of Artetxe et al. (2016) with the 5,000 entry dictionary.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"For that purpose, we took 100 random examples from the test set in the [1-5K] frequency bin, another 100 from the [5K20K] frequency bin and 30 from the [100K-200K] frequency bin, and manually analyzed each of the errors made by all the 4 different variants.
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"Our analysis first reveals that, in all the cases, about a third of the translations taken as erroneous according to the gold standard are not so in real-
ity.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
This corresponds to both different morphological variants of the gold standard translations (e.g. dichiarato/dichiarò) and other valid translations that were missing in the gold standard (e.g. climb → salita instead of the gold standard scalato).,6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"This phenomenon is considerably more pronounced in the first frequency bins, which already have a much higher accuracy according to the gold standard.
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"As for the actual errors, we observe that nearly a third of them correspond to named entities for all the different variants.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, the vast majority of the proposed translations in these cases are also named entities (e.g. Ryan→ Jason, John→ Paolo), which are often highly related to the original ones (e.g. Volvo→ BMW, Olympus→ Nikon).",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"While these are clear errors, it is understandable that these methods are unable to discriminate between named entities to this degree based solely on the distributional hypothesis, in particular when it comes to common proper names (e.g. John, Andy), and one could design alternative strategies to address this issue like taking the edit distance as an additional signal.
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"For the remaining errors, all systems tend to propose translations that have some degree of relationship with the correct ones, including nearsynonyms (e.g. guidelines → raccomandazioni), antonyms (e.g. sender→ destinatario) and words in the same semantic field (e.g. nominalism→ intuizionismo / innatismo, which are all philosophical doctrines).",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"However, there are also a few instances where the relationship is weak or unclear (e.g. loch→ giardini, sweep→ serrare).",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"We also observe a few errors that are related to multiwords or collocations (e.g. carrier→ aereo, presumably related to the multiword air carrier / linea aerea), as well as some rare word that is repeated across many translations (Ferruzzi), which could be attributed to the hubness problem (Dinu et al., 2015; Lazaridou et al., 2015).
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"All in all, our error analysis reveals that the baseline method of Artetxe et al. (2016) and the proposed algorithm tend to make the same kind of errors regardless of the seed dictionary used by the latter, which reinforces our interpretation in the previous section regarding an underlying optimization objective that is independent from any training dictionary.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"Moreover, it shows that the quality of the learned mappings is much better than what the raw accuracy numbers might sug-
gest, encouraging the incorporation of these techniques in other applications.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"In this work, we propose a simple self-learning framework to learn bilingual word embedding mappings in combination with any embedding mapping and dictionary induction technique.",7 Conclusions and future work,[0],[0]
"Our experiments on bilingual lexicon induction and crosslingual word similarity show that our method is able to learn high quality bilingual embeddings from as little bilingual evidence as a 25 word dictionary or an automatically generated list of numerals, obtaining results that are competitive with state-of-the-art systems using much richer bilingual resources like larger dictionaries or parallel corpora.",7 Conclusions and future work,[0],[0]
"In spite of its simplicity, a more detailed analysis shows that our method is implicitly optimizing a meaningful objective function that is independent from any bilingual data which, with a better optimization method, might allow to learn bilingual word embeddings in a completely unsupervised manner.

"In the future, we would like to delve deeper into this direction and fine-tune our method so it can reliably learn high quality bilingual word embeddings without any bilingual evidence at all.",7 Conclusions and future work,[0],[0]

Power-stability and orthogonal decomposition The exponential runtime of our algorithm stems from the fact that the set UN of Newton-stable eigenpairs ofWσ is typically O(2d).,4. Learning in the presence of noise,[0],[0]
"However, in some cases, the set U∗ of d relevant eigenpairs has additional structure so that a smaller candidate set may be computed instead of UN .",4. Learning in the presence of noise,[0],[0]

",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Terminology A fixation is a relatively long stay of gaze on a visual object (such as words in text) where as a sacccade corresponds to quick shifting of gaze between two positions of rest.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Forward and backward saccades are called progressions and regressions respectively.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A scanpath is a line graph that contains fixations as nodes and saccades as edges.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Presence of linguistic subtleties often induces (a) surprisal (Kutas and Hillyard, 1980; Malsburg et al., 2015), due to the underlying disparity /context incongruity",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"or (b) higher cognitive load (Rayner and Duffy, 1986), due to the presence of lexically and syntactically complex structures.",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"While surprisal accounts for irregular saccades (Malsburg et al., 2015), higher cognitive
load results in longer fixation duration (Kliegl et al., 2004).
",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
Mishra et al. (2016b) find that presence of sarcasm in text triggers either irregular saccadic patterns or unusually high duration fixations than non-sarcastic texts (illustrated through example scanpath representations in Figure 1).,2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"For sentiment bearing texts, highly subtle eyemovement patterns are observed for semantically/pragmatically complex negative opinions (expressing irony, sarcasm, thwarted expectations, etc.) than the simple ones (Mishra et al., 2016b).",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
The association between linguistic subtleties and eye-movement patterns could be captured through sophisticated feature engineering that considers both gaze and text inputs.,2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"In our work, CNN takes the onus of feature engineering.",2 Eye-movement and Linguistic Subtleties,[0],[0]
"CNNs have been quite effective in learning filters for image processing tasks, filters being used to transform the input image into more informative feature space (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"Filters learned at various CNN layers are quite similar to handcrafted filters used for detection of edges, contours, and removal of redundant backgrounds.",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"We believe, a similar technique can also be applied to eye-movement data, where the learned filters will, hopefully, extract informative cognitive features.",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"For instance, for sarcasm, we expect the network to learn filters that detect long distance saccades (refer to Figure 2 for an analogical il-
lustration).",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
"With more number of convolution filters of different dimensions, the network may extract multiple features related to different gaze attributes (such as fixations, progressions, regressions and skips) and will be free from any form of human bias that manually extracted features are susceptible to.",3 Why Convolutional Neural Network?,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows the CNN architecture with two components for processing and extracting features from text and gaze inputs.,4 Learning Feature Representations: The CNN Architecture,[0],[0]
The components are explained below.,4 Learning Feature Representations: The CNN Architecture,[0],[0]
The text component is quite similar to the one proposed by Kim (2014) for sentence classification.,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
Words (in the form of one-hot representation) in the input text are first replaced by their embeddings of dimension K (ith word in the sentence represented by an embedding vector xi ∈ RK).,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"As per Kim (2014), a multi-channel variant of CNN (referred to as MULTICHANNELTEXT) can be implemented by using two channels of embeddingsone that remains static throughout training (referred to as STATICTEXT), and the other one that gets updated during training (referred to as NONSTATICTEXT).",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"We separately experiment with static, non-static and multi-channel variants.
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"For each possible input channel of the text component, a given text is transformed into a tensor of fixed length N (padded with zero-tensors wherever
necessary to tackle length variations) by concatenating the word embeddings.
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"x1:N = x1 ⊕ x2 ⊕ x3 ⊕ ...⊕ xN (1)
where ⊕ is the concatenation operator.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"To extract local features1, convolution operation is applied.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"Convolution operation involves a filter, W ∈ RHK , which is convolved with a window of H embeddings to produce a local feature for the H words.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"A local feature, ci is generated from a window of embeddings xi:i+H−1 by applying a non linear function (such as a hyperbolic tangent) over the convoluted output.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"Mathematically,
ci = f(W.xi:i+H−1 + b) (2)
where b ∈ R is the bias and f is the non-linear function.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"This operation is applied to each possible window of H words to produce a feature map (c) for the window size H .
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
c =,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"[c1, c2, c3, ..., cN−H+1] (3)
A global feature is then obtained by applying max pooling operation2 (Collobert et al., 2011) over the feature map.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"The idea behind max-pooling is to capture the most important feature - one with the highest value - for each feature map.
",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
We have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one filter (red bordered portions in Figure 3 illustrate the case of H = 2).,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
The model uses multiple filters for each filter size to obtain multiple features representing the text.,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
"In the MULTICHANNELTEXT variant, for a window of H words, the convolution operation is separately applied on both the embedding channels.",4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
Local features learned from both the channels are concatenated before applying max-pooling.,4.1 Text Component,[0],[0]
The gaze component deals with scanpaths of multiple participants annotating the same text.,4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Scanpaths can be pre-processed to extract two sequences3 of gaze data to form separate channels of input: (1) A sequence of normalized4 durations of fixations (in milliseconds) in the order in which
1features specific to a region in case of images or window of words in case of text
2mean pooling does not perform well.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"3like text-input, gaze sequences are padded where necessary 4scaled across participants using min-max normalization to reduce subjectivity
they appear in the scanpath, and (2) A sequence of position of fixations (in terms of word id) in the order in which they appear in the scanpath.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
These channels are related to two fundamental gaze attributes such as fixation and saccade respectively.,4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"With two channels, we thus have three possible configurations of the gaze component such as (i) FIXATION, where the input is normalized fixation duration sequence, (ii) SACCADE, where the input is fixation position sequence, and (iii) MULTICHANNELGAZE, where both the inputs channels are considered.
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"For each possible input channel, the input is in the form of a P × G matrix (with P → number of participants and G → length of the input sequence).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Each element of the matrix gij ∈ R, with i ∈ P and j ∈ G, corresponds to the jth gaze attribute (either fixation duration or word id, depending on the channel) of the input sequence of the ith participant.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Now, unlike the text component, here we apply convolution operation across two dimensions i.e. choosing a two dimensional convolution filter W ∈ RJK (for simplicity, we have kept J = K, thus , making the dimension of W , J2).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"For the dimension size of J2, a local feature cij is computed from the window of gaze elements gij:(i+J−1)(j+J−1) by,
cij = f(W.gij:(i+J−1)(j+J−1) + b) (4)
where b ∈ R is the bias and f is a non-linear func-
tion.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"This operation is applied to each possible window of size J2 to produce a feature map (c),
c =[c11, c12, c13, ..., c1(G−J+1),
c21, c22, c23, ..., c2(G−J+1), ...,
c(P−J+1)1, c(P−J+1)2, ..., c(P−J+1)(G−J+1)]
(5)
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
A global feature is then obtained by applying max pooling operation.,4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Unlike the text component, max-pooling operator is applied to a 2D window of local features size M × N (for simplicity, we set M = N , denoted henceforth as M2).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"For the window of size M2, the pooling operation on c will result in as set of global features ĉJ = max{cij:(i+M−1)(j+M−1)} for each possible",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"i, j.
We have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one filter (of 2D window size J2 and the max-pooling window size of M2).",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"In Figure 3, red and blue bordered portions illustrate the cases of J2 =",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"[3, 3] and M2 = [2, 2] respectively.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Like the text component, the gaze component also uses multiple filters for each filter size to obtain multiple features representing the gaze input.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"In the MULTICHANNELGAZE variant, for a 2D window of J2, the convolution operation is separately applied on both fixation duration and saccade channels and local features learned from both the channels are concatenated before maxpooling is applied.
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Once the global features are learned from both the text and gaze components, they are merged
and passed to a fully connected feed forward layer (with number of units set to 150) followed by a SoftMax layer that outputs the the probabilistic distribution over the class labels.
",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"The gaze component of our network is not invariant of the order in which the scanpath data is given as input- i.e., the P rows in the P × G can not be shuffled, even if each row is independent from others.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"The only way we can think of for addressing this issue is by applying convolution operations to all P × G matrices formed with all the permutations of P , capturing every possible ordering.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, this makes the training process significantly less scalable, as the number of model parameters to be learned becomes huge.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
"As of now, training and testing are carried out by keeping the order of the input constant.",4.2 Gaze Component,[0],[0]
We now share several details regarding our experiments below.,5 Experiment Setup,[0],[0]
We conduct experiments for two binaryclassification tasks of sentiment and sarcasm using two publicly available datasets enriched with eye-movement information.,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
Dataset 1 has been released by Mishra et al. (2016a).,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
It contains 994 text snippets with 383 positive and 611 negative examples.,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
"Out of the 994 snippets, 350 are sarcastic.",5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
"Dataset 2 has been used by Joshi et al. (2014) and it consists of 843 snippets comprising movie reviews and normalized tweets out of which 443 are positive, and 400 are negative.",5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
Eye-movement data of 7 and 5 readers is available for each snippet for dataset 1 and 2 respectively.,5.1 Dataset,[0],[0]
"With text component alone we have three variants such as STATICTEXT, NONSTATICTEXT and MULTICHANNELTEXT (refer to Section 4.1).",5.2 CNN Variants,[0],[0]
"Similarly, with gaze component we have variants such as FIXATION, SACCADE and MULTICHANNELGAZE (refer to Section 4.2).",5.2 CNN Variants,[0],[0]
"With both text and gaze components, 9 more variants could thus beexperimented with.",5.2 CNN Variants,[0],[0]
"For text component, we experiment with filter widths (H) of [3, 4].",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"For the gaze component, 2D filters (J2) set to [3× 3], [4× 4] respectively.",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"The
max pooling 2D window, M2, is set to [2× 2].",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"In both gaze and text components, number of filters is set to 150, resulting in 150 feature maps for each window.",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
These model hyper-parameters are fixed by trial and error and are possibly good enough to provide a first level insight into our system.,5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"Tuning of hyper-parameters might help in improving the performance of our framework, which is on our future research agenda.",5.3 Hyper-parameters,[0],[0]
"For regularization dropout is employed both on the embedding and the penultimate layers with a constraint on l2-norms of the weight vectors (Hinton et al., 2012).",5.4 Regularization,[0],[0]
"Dropout prevents co-adaptation of hidden units by randomly dropping out - i.e., setting to zero - a proportion p of the hidden units during forward propagation.",5.4 Regularization,[0],[0]
We set p to 0.25.,5.4 Regularization,[0],[0]
"We use ADADELTA optimizer (Zeiler, 2012), with a learning rate of 0.1.",5.5 Training,[0],[0]
The input batch size is set to 32 and number of training iterations (epochs) is set to 200.,5.5 Training,[0],[0]
10% of the training data is used for validation.,5.5 Training,[0],[0]
"Initializing the embedding layer with of pretrained embeddings can be more effective than random initialization (Kim, 2014).",5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, we have used embeddings learned using the movie reviews with one sentence per review dataset (Pang and Lee, 2005).",5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]
"It is worth noting that, for a small dataset like ours, using a small data-set like the one from (Pang and Lee, 2005) helps in reducing the number model parameters resulting in faster learning of embeddings.",5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]
The results are also quite close to the ones obtained using word2vec facilitated by Mikolov et al. (2013).,5.6 Use of Pre-trained Embeddings:,[0],[0]

"For sarcasm detection, we compare Mishra et al. (2016b)’s sarcasm classifier with ours using dataset 1 (with available gold standard labels for sarcasm).",5.7 Comparison with Existing Work,[0],[0]
We follow the same 10-fold train-test configuration as these existing works for consistency.,5.7 Comparison with Existing Work,[0],[0]
"In this section, we discuss the results for different model variants for sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection tasks.",6 Results,[0],[0]
Table 1 presents results for sentiment analysis task.,6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"For dataset 1, different variants of our CNN architecture outperform the best systems reported by Mishra et al. (2016c), with a maximum F-score improvement of 3.8%.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
This improvement is statistically significant of p < 0.05 as confirmed by McNemar test.,6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we observe an F-score improvement of around 5% for CNNs with both gaze and text components as compared to CNNs with only text components (similar to the system by Kim (2014)), which is also statistically significant (with p < 0.05).
",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"For dataset 2, CNN based approaches do not perform better than manual feature based approaches.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"However, variants with both text and gaze components outperform the ones with only text component (Kim, 2014), with a maximum Fscore improvement of 2.9%.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"We observe that for dataset 2, training accuracy reaches 100 within 25 epochs with validation accuracy stable around 50%, indicating the possibility of overfitting.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
Tuning the regularization parameters specific to dataset 2 may help here.,6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"Even though CNN might
not be proving to be a choice as good as handcrafted features for dataset 2, the bottom line remains that incorporation of gaze data into CNN consistently improves the performance over onlytext-based CNN variants.",6.1 Results for Sentiment Analysis Task,[0],[0]
"For sarcasm detection, our CNN model variants outperform traditional systems by a maximum margin of 11.27% (Table 2).",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"However, the improvement by adding the gaze component to the CNN network is just 1.34%, which is statistically insignificant over CNN with text component.",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"While inspecting the sarcasm dataset, we observe a clear difference between the vocabulary of sarcasm and non-sarcasm classes in our dataset.",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"This, perhaps, was captured well by the text component, especially the variant with only non-static embeddings.",6.2 Results for Sarcasm Detection Task,[0],[0]
"In this section, some important observations from our experiments are discussed.",7 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Embedding dimension has proven to have a deep impact on the performance of neural systems (dos Santos and Gatti, 2014; Collobert et al., 2011).
",7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
We repeated our experiments by varying the embedding dimensions in the range of [50-300]5 and observed that reducing embedding dimension improves the F-scores by a little margin.,7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
Small embedding dimensions are probably reducing the chances of over-fitting when the data size is small.,7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
"We also observe that for different embedding dimensions, performance of CNN with both gaze and text components is consistently better than that with only text component.",7.1 Effect of Embedding Dimension Variation,[0],[0]
"Non-static embedding channel has a major role in tuning embeddings for sentiment analysis by bringing adjectives expressing similar sentiment close to each other (e.g, good and nice), where as static channel seems to prevent over-tuning of embeddings (over-tuning often brings verbs like love closer to the pronoun I in embedding space, purely due to higher co-occurrence of these two words in sarcastic examples).",7.2 Effect of Static / Non-static Text Channels,[0],[0]
"For sentiment detection, saccade channel seems to be handing text having semantic incongruity (due
5a standard range (Liu et al., 2015; Melamud et al., 2016)
to the presence of irony / sarcasm) better.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"Fixation channel does not help much, may be because of higher variance in fixation duration.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"For sarcasm detection, fixation and saccade channels perform with similar accuracy when employed separately.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"Accuracy reduces with gaze multichannel, may be because of higher variation of both fixations and saccades across sarcastic and nonsarcastic classes, as opposed to sentiment classes.",7.3 Effect of Fixation / Saccade Channels,[0],[0]
"To examine how good the features learned by the CNN are, we analyzed the features for a few example cases.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]

"Example 1 contains sarcasm while examples 2, 3 and 4 are non-sarcastic.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"To see if there is any difference in the automatically learned features between text-only and combined text and gaze variants, we examine the feature vector (of dimension 150) for the examples obtained from different model variants.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
Output of the hidden layer after merge layer is considered as features learned by the network.,7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"We plot the features, in the form of color-bars, following Li et al. (2016) - denser col-
ors representing feature with higher magnitude.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"In Figure 4, we show only two representative model variants viz., MULTICHANNELTEXT and MULTICHANNELTEXT+ MULTICHANNELGAZE.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"As one can see, addition of gaze information helps to generate features with more subtle differences (marked by blue rectangular boxes) for sarcastic and non-sarcastic texts.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"It is also interesting to note that in the marked region, features for the sarcastic texts exhibit more intensity than the nonsarcastic ones - perhaps capturing the notion that sarcasm typically conveys an intensified negative opinion.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"This difference is not clear in feature vectors learned by text-only systems for instances like example 2, which has been incorrectly classified by MULTICHANNELTEXT.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"Example 4 is incorrectly classified by both the systems, perhaps due to lack of context.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]
"In cases like this, addition of gaze information does not help much in learning more distinctive features, as it becomes difficult for even humans to classify such texts.",7.4 Effectiveness of the CNN-learned Features,[0],[0]

Jeon and Kim (2017) proposed to enhance the transformation modeling capacity of CNNs by adaptively learning the filter shapes through backpropagation.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"De Brabandere et al. (2016) introduced an architecture to generate the future frames conditioned on given image(s), by adapting the CNN filter weights to the motion within previous video frames.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Although CNNs have been widely adopted in a large number of NLP applications, improving the adaptivity of vanilla CNN modules has been considerably less studied.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, the work reported in this paper is the first attempt to develop more flexible and adjustable CNN architecture for modeling sentences.

"The output feature maps of the convolutional layer, i.e., p ∈ RK×(T−h+1) are then passed to the pooling layer, which takes the maximum value in every row of p, forming a K-dimensional vector, z.",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
This operation attempts to keep the most salient feature detected by every filter and discard the information from less fundamental text fragments.,3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]
"Moreover, the max-over-time nature of the pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) guarantees that the size of the obtained representation is independent of the sentence length.
",3.1 Basic CNN for text representations,[0],[0]

"The proposed architecture to learn contextsensitive filters is composed of two principal modules: (i) a filter generation module, which produces a set of filters conditioned on the input sentence; and (ii) an adaptive convolution module, which applies the generated filters to an input sentence (this sentence may be either the same as or different from the first input, as discussed further in Section 3.3).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"The two modules are jointly differentiable, and the overall architecture can be trained in an end-to-end manner.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]

Filter generation module Instead of utilizing fixed filter weightsW for different inputs (as (1)), our model generates a set of filters conditioned on the input sentence X .",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Given an input X , the filter-generation module can be implemented, in principle, as any deep (differentiable) architecture.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"However, in order to handle input sentences of variable length common in natural language, we design a generic filter generation module to produce filters with a predefined size.
",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"First, the input X is encapsulated into a fixedlength vector (code) z with the dimension of l, via a basic CNN model, where one convolutional layer is employed along with the pooling operation (as described in Section 3.1).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"On top of this hidden representation z, a deconvolutional layer, which performs transposed operations of convolutions (Radford et al., 2016), is further applied to produce a unique set of filters forX (as illustrated in Figure 1):

f = DCNN(z;θd) , (3)
where θe and θd are the learned parameters in each layer of the filter-generating module, respectively.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we convolve z with a filter of size (fs, l, kx, ky), where fs is the number of generated filters and the kernel size is (kx, ky).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"The output will be a tensor of shape (fs, kx, ky).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Since the dimension of hidden representation z is independent of input-sentence length, this framework guarantees that the generated filters are of the same shape and size for every sentence.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, the encoding part of filter generation module abstracts the information from sentenceX into z. Based on this representation, the deconvolutional up-sampling layer determines a set of fixedsize, fine-grained filters f for the specific input.
",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
Adaptive convolution module The adaptive convolution module takes as inputs the generated filters f and an input sentence.,3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
This sentence and the input to the filter-generation module may be identical (as in Figure 1) or different (as in Figure 2).,3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"With the sample-specific filters, the input sentence is adaptively encoded, again, via a basic CNN architecture as in Section 3.1, i.e., one convolutional and one pooling layer.",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Notably, there are no additional parameters in the adaptive convolution module (no bias term is employed).
",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]
"Our ACNN framework can be seen as a generalization of the basic CNN, which can be represented as an ACNN by setting the outputs of the filter-generation module to a constant, regardless of the contextual information from input sentence(s).",3.2 Learning context-sensitive filters,[0],[0]

"Conventionally, a question q and an answer a are independently encoded by two basic CNNs to fixed-length vector representations, denoted hq and ha, respectively.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
They are then directly employed to predict the judgement y.,3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"This strategy could be suboptimal, since no communication (information sharing) occurs between the questionanswer pair until the top prediction layer.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, while the model is inferring the representation for a question, if the meaning of the answer is
taken into account, those features that are relevant for final prediction are more likely to be extracted.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"So motivated, we propose an adaptive CNN-based question-answer (AdaQA) model for this problem.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The AdaQA model can be divided into three modules: filter generation, adaptive convolution, and matching modules, as depicted schematically in Figure 2.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]

"Similar to the setup in Section 3.2, we also employ a two-step process to produce the filters.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"For a question Q, the generating process is:
zq = CNN(Q;θqe), (4) f q = DCNN(zq;θ q d) (5)

"The two sets of filter weights are then passed to adaptive convolution modules, along with Q and A, to obtain the extracted question and answer embeddings.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"That is, the question embedding is convolved with the filters produced by the answer and vise versa (ψq and ψa are the bias terms to be learned).",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"The key idea is to abstract information from the answer (or question) that is pertinent to the corresponding question (or answer).

"Compared to a Siamese CNN architecture (Bromley et al., 1994), our model selectively encapsulates the most important features for judgement prediction, removing less vital information.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]

",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]
"Notably, we share the weights of filter generating networks for both the question and answer, so that the model adaptivity for answer selection can be improved without an excessive increase in the number of parameters.",3.3 Extension to text sequence matching,[0],[0]

are generated conditioned on the question; (iv) a two-way AdaQA model as described in Section 2.4, where both sentences are adaptively encoded, with filters generated conditioned on the other sequence; (v) considering that the proposed filter generation mechanism is complementary to the attention layer typically employed in sequence matching tasks (see Section 3.4), we experiment with another model variant that combines the proposed context-aware filter generation mechanism with the multi-perspective attention layer introduced in (Wang et al., 2017b).

"In this paper, we make a first essential step of addressing the problem of learning continuous semantic representations (SEMVECs) for symbolic expressions.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our aim is, given access to a training set of pairs of expressions for which semantic equivalence is known, to assign continuous vectors to symbolic expressions in such a way that semantically equivalent, but syntactically diverse expressions are assigned to identical (or highly similar) continuous vectors.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is an important but hard problem; learning composable SEMVECs of symbolic expressions requires that we learn about the semantics of symbolic elements and operators and how they map to the continuous representation space, thus encapsulating implicit knowledge about symbolic semantics and its recursive abstractive nature.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As we show in our evaluation, relatively simple logical and polynomial expressions present significant challenges and their semantics cannot be sufficiently represented by existing neural network architectures.

"To tackle this problem, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks (EQNET).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Problem Hardness.,2. Model,[0],[0]
Finding the equivalence of arbitrary symbolic expressions is a NP-hard problem or worse.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"For example, if we focus on boolean expressions, reducing an expression to the representation of the false equivalence class amounts to proving its non-satisfiability — an NPcomplete problem.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Of course, we do not expect to circum-
vent an NP-complete problem with neural networks.",2. Model,[0],[0]
A network for solving boolean equivalence would require an exponential number of nodes in the size of the expression if P 6= NP .,2. Model,[0],[0]
"Instead, our goal is to develop architectures that efficiently learn to solve the equivalence problems for expressions that are similar to a smaller number of expressions in a given training set.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"The supplementary material shows a sample of such expressions that illustrate the hardness of this problem.
",2. Model,[0],[0]
Notation and Framework.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"To allow our representations to be compositional, we employ the general framework of recursive neural networks (TREENN)",2. Model,[0],[0]
"(Socher et al., 2012; 2013), in our case operating on tree structures of the syntactic parse of a formula.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Given a tree T , TREENNs learn distributed representations for each node in the tree by recursively combining the representations of its subtrees using a neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We denote the children of a node n as ch(n) which is a (possibly empty) ordered tuple of nodes.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"We also use par(n) to refer to the parent node of n. Each node in our tree has a type, e.g. a terminal node could be of type “a” referring to the variable a or of type “and” referring to a node of the logical AND (∧) operation.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We refer to the type of a node n as τn.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"In pseudocode, TREENNs retrieve the representation of a tree T rooted at node ρ, by invoking the function TREENN(ρ) that returns a vector representation rρ ∈ RD, i.e., a SEMVEC.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"The function is defined as TREENN (current node n)
if n is not a leaf then rn ← COMBINE(TREENN(c0), . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", TREENN(ck), τn), where (c0, . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", ck) = ch(n) else rn ← LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn)
return rn The general framework of TREENN allows two points of variation, the implementation of LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING and COMBINE.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) define LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING as a simple lookup operation within a matrix of embeddings and COMBINE as a single-layer neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"As discussed next, these will both prove to be serious limitations in our setting.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"To train these networks to learn SEMVECs, we will use a supervised objective based on a set of known equivalence relations (see Section 2.2).",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Our domain requires that the network learns to abstract away syntax, assigning identical representations to expressions that may be syntactically different but semantically equivalent, and also assigning different representations to expressions that may be syntactically very similar but nonequivalent.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In this work, we find that standard neural architectures do not handle well this challenge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To represent semantics from syntax, we need to learn to recursively
compose and decompose semantic representations and remove syntactic “noise”.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Any syntactic operation may significantly change semantics (e.g. negation, or appending ∧FALSE) while we may reach the same semantic state through many possible operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This necessitates using high-curvature operations over the semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, some operations are semantically reversible and thus we need to learn reversible semantic representations (e.g. ¬¬A and A should have an identical SEMVECs).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Based on these, we define neural equivalence networks (EQNET), which learn to compose representations of equivalence classes into new equivalence classes (Figure 1a).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Our network follows the TREENN architecture, i.e. is implemented using TREENN to model the compositional nature of symbolic expressions but is adapted based on the domain requirements.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The extensions we introduce have two aims: first, to improve the network training; and second, and more interestingly, to encourage the learned representations to abstract away surface level information while retaining semantic content.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
The first extension that we introduce is to the network structure at each layer in the tree.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) use a single-layer neural network at each tree node.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"During our preliminary investigations and in Section 3, we found that single layer networks are not adequately expressive to capture all operations that transform the input SEMVECs to the output SEMVEC and maintain semantic equivalences, requiring high-curvature operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Part of the problem stems from the fact that within the Euclidean space of SEMVECs some operations need to be non-linear.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
For example a simple XOR boolean operator requires high-curvature operations in the continuous semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Instead, we turn to multi-layer neural
networks.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In particular, we define the network as shown in the function COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This uses a twolayer MLP with a residual-like connection to compute the SEMVEC of each parent node in that syntax tree given that of its children.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Each node type τn, e.g., each logical operator, has a different set of weights.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We experimented with deeper networks but this did not yield any improvements.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"However, as TREENNs become deeper, they suffer from optimization issues, such as diminishing and exploding gradients.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"This is essentially because of the highly compositional nature of tree structures, where the same network (i.e. the COMBINE non-linear function) is used recursively, causing it to “echo” its own errors and producing unstable feedback loops.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We observe this problem even with only two-layer MLPs, as the overall network can become quite deep when using two layers for each node in the syntax tree.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We resolve this issue in the training procedure by constraining each SEMVEC to have unit norm.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"That is, we set LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn) = Cτn/ ‖Cτn‖2 , and we normalize the output of the final layer of COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The normalization step of l̄out and Cτn is somewhat similar to weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) and vaguely resembles layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Normalizing the SEMVECs partially resolves issues with diminishing and exploding gradients, and removes a spurious degree of freedom in the semantic representation.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"As simple as this modification may seem, we found it vital for obtaining good performance, and all of our multi-layer TREENNs converged to low-performing settings without it.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although these modifications seem to improve the representation capacity of the network and its ability to be trained, we found that they were not on their own sufficient for good
performance.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In our early experiments, we noticed that the networks were primarily focusing on syntax instead of semantics, i.e., expressions that were nearby in the continuous space were primarily ones that were syntactically similar.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"At the same time, we observed that the networks did not learn to unify representations of the same equivalence class, observing multiple syntactically distinct but semantically equivalent expressions to have distant SEMVECs.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Therefore we modify the training objective in order to encourage the representations to become more abstract, reducing their dependence on surface-level syntactic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We add a regularization term on the SEMVECs that we call a subexpression autoencoder (SUBEXPAE).,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We design this regularization to encourage the SEMVECs to have two properties: abstraction and reversibility.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Because abstraction arguably means removing irrelevant information, a network with a bottleneck layer seems natural, but we want the training objective to encourage the bottleneck to discard syntactic information rather than semantic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To achieve this, we introduce a component that aims to encourage reversibility, which we explain by an example.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Observe that given the semantic representation of any two of the three nodes of a subexpression (by which we mean the parent, left child, right child of an expression tree)",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
it is often possible to completely determine or at least place strong constraints on the semantics of the third.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, consider a boolean formula F (a, b) = F1(a, b) ∨ F2(a, b) where F1 and F2 are arbitrary propositional formulae over the variables a, b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then clearly if we know that F implies that a is true but F1 does not, then F2 must imply that a is true.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More generally, if F belongs to some equivalence class e0 and F1 belongs to a different class e1, we want the continuous representation of F2 to reflect that there are strong constraints on the equivalence class of F2.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Subexpression autoencoding encourages abstraction by employing an autoencoder with a bottleneck, thereby removing irrelevant information from the representations, and encourages reversibility by autoencoding the parent and child representations together, to encourage dependence in the representations of parents and children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More specifically, given any node p in the tree with children c0 . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"ck, we can define a parent-children tuple",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"[rc0 , . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
", rck , rp] containing the (computed) SEMVECs of the children and parent nodes.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
What SUBEXPAE does is to autoencode this representation tuple into a low-dimensional space with a denoising autoencoder.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We then seek to minimize the reconstruction error of the child representations (r̃c0 , . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
", r̃ck ) as well as the reconstructed parent representation r̃p that can be computed from the reconstructed children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More formally, we minimize the return value of SUBEXPAE in Figure 1c where n is a binary noise vector with κ percent of its elements set to zero.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Note that the encoder is specific to the parent node type τp.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although our SUBEXPAE may seem similar to the recursive autoencoders of Socher et al. (2011), it differs
in two major ways.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE autoencodes on the entire parent-children representation tuple, rather than the child representations alone.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, the encoding is not used to compute the parent representation, but only serves as a regularizer.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Subexpression autoencoding has several desirable effects.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, it forces each parent-children tuple to lie in a lowdimensional space, requiring the network to compress information from the individual subexpressions.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, because the denoising autoencoder is reconstructing parent and child representations together, this encourages child representations to be predictable from parents and siblings.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Putting these two together, the goal is that the information discarded by the autoencoder bottleneck will be more syntactic than semantic, assuming that the semantics of child node is more predictable from its parent and sibling than its syntactic realization.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The goal is to nudge the network to learn consistent, reversible semantics.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Additionally, subexpression autoencoding has the potential to gradually unify distant representations that belong to the same equivalence class.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To illustrate this point, imagine two semantically equivalent c′0 and c ′′ 0 child nodes of different expressions that
have distant SEMVECs, i.e. ∥∥rc′0 − rc′′0 ∥∥2 although COMBINE(rc′0 , . . . )",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"≈ COMBINE(rc′′0 , . . . ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In some cases due to the autoencoder noise, the differences between the input tuple x′,x′′ that contain rc′0 and rc′′0 will be non-existent and the decoder will predict a single location r̃c0 (possibly different from rc′0 and rc′′0 ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then, when minimizing the reconstruction error, both rc′0 and rc′′0 will be attracted to r̃c0 and eventually should merge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We train EQNETs from a dataset of expressions whose semantic equivalence is known.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Given a training set T = {T1 . . .,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"TN} of parse trees of expressions, we assume that the training set is partitioned into equivalence classes E = {e1 . . .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
eJ}.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We use a supervised objective similar to classification; the difference between classification and our setting is that whereas standard classification problems consider a fixed set of class labels, in our setting the number of equivalence classes in the training set will vary with N .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Given an expression tree T that belongs to the equivalence class ei ∈ E , we compute the probability
P (ei|T ) =",2.2. Training,[0],[0]

qej,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"+ bj
) (1) where qei are model parameters that we can interpret as representations of each equivalence class that appears in the training class, and bi are scalar bias terms.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Note that in this work, we only use information about the equivalence class of the whole expression T , ignoring available information about subexpressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"This is without loss of generality, because if we do know the equivalence class of a subexpression of T , we can simply add that subexpression to
the training set.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"To train the model, we use a max-margin objective that maximizes classification accuracy, i.e.
LACC(T, ei) = max (
0, arg max ej 6=ei,ej∈E log P (ej |T ) P (ei|T ) +m ) (2)
where m > 0 is a scalar margin.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"And therefore the optimized loss function for a single expression tree T that belongs to equivalence class ei ∈ E is
L(T, ei) = LACC(T, ei) + µ |Q| ∑ n∈Q SUBEXPAE(ch(n), n)
(3)
",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"where Q = {n ∈ T : | ch(n)| > 0}, i.e. contains the nonleaf nodes of T and µ ∈ (0, 1] a scalar weight.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We found that subexpression autoencoding is counterproductive early in training, before the SEMVECs begin to represent aspects of semantics.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"So, for each epoch t, we set µ = 1− 10−νt with ν ≥ 0.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Instead of the supervised objective that we propose, an alternative option for training EQNET would be a Siamese objective (Chopra et al., 2005) that learns about similarities (rather than equivalence) between expressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"In practice, we found the optimization to be very unstable, yielding suboptimal performance.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
We believe that this has to do with the compositional and recursive nature of the task that creates unstable dynamics and the fact that equivalence is a stronger property than similarity.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Datasets.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate datasets of expressions grouped into equivalence classes from two domains.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The datasets from the BOOL domain contain boolean expressions and the POLY datasets contain polynomial expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In both domains, an expression is either a variable, a binary operator that combines two expressions, or a unary operator applied to a single expression.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When defining equivalence, we interpret distinct variables as referring to different entities in the domain, so that, e.g., the polynomials c · (a · a+ b) and f ·(d·d+e) are not equivalent.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For each domain, we generate “simple” datasets which use a smaller set of possible operators and “standard” datasets which use a larger set of more complex operators.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate each dataset by exhaustively generating all parse trees up to a maximum tree size.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
All expressions are symbolically simplified into a canonical from in order to determine their equivalence class and are grouped accordingly.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows the datasets we generated.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
In the supplementary material we present some sample expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For the polynomial domain, we also generated ONEV-POLY datasets, which are polynomials over a single variable, since they are similar to the setting considered by Zaremba et al. (2014) — although ONEV-POLY is still a little more general because it is not restricted to homogeneous polynomials.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Learning SEMVECs for boolean expressions
is already a hard problem; with n boolean variables, there are 22 n
equivalence classes (i.e. one for each possible truth table).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We split the datasets into training, validation and test sets.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We create two test sets, one to measure generalization performance on equivalence classes that were seen in the training data (SEENEQCLASS), and one to measure generalization to unseen equivalence classes (UNSEENEQCLASS).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
It is easiest to describe UNSEENEQCLASS first.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To create the UNSEENEQCLASS, we randomly select 20% of all the equivalence classes, and place all of their expressions in the test set.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We select equivalence classes only if they contain at least two expressions but less than three times the average number of expressions per equivalence class.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We thus avoid selecting very common (and hence trivial to learn) equivalence classes in the testset.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Then, to create SEENEQCLASS, we take the remaining 80% of the equivalence classes, and randomly split the expressions in each class into training, validation, SEENEQCLASS test in the proportions 60%–15%–25%.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]

Metrics.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]

"To do this we consider a type of transfer setting, in which we train on simpler datasets, but test on more complex ones; for example, training on the training set of BOOL5 but testing on the testset of BOOL8.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
We average over 11 different train-test pairs (full list in supplementary material) and show the results in Figure 3a and Figure 3b.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]

",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Impact of EQNET Components EQNETs differ from traditional TREENNs in two major ways, which we analyze here.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE improves performance.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When training the network with and without SUBEXPAE, on average, the area under the curve (AUC) of scorek decreases by 16.8% on the SEENEQCLASS and 19.7% on the UNSEENEQCLASS.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This difference is smaller in the transfer setting, where AUC decreases by 8.8% on average.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, even in this setting we observe that SUBEXPAE helps more in large and diverse datasets.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The second key difference to traditional TREENNs is the output normalization and the residual connections.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Comparing our model to the one-layer and two-layer TREENNs again, we find that output normalization results in important improvements (the two-layer TREENNs have on average 60.9% smaller AUC).",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We note that only the combination of the residual connections and the output normalization improve the performance, whereas when used separately, there are no significant improvements over the two-layer TREENNs.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]

"Our aim is, given access to a training set of pairs of expressions for which semantic equivalence is known, to assign continuous vectors to symbolic expressions in such a way that semantically equivalent, but syntactically diverse expressions are assigned to identical (or highly similar) continuous vectors.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is an important but hard problem; learning composable SEMVECs of symbolic expressions requires that we learn about the semantics of symbolic elements and operators and how they map to the continuous representation space, thus encapsulating implicit knowledge about symbolic semantics and its recursive abstractive nature.",1.

"As we show in our evaluation, relatively simple logical and polynomial expressions present significant challenges and their semantics cannot be sufficiently represented by existing neural network architectures.

Problem Hardness.,2. Model,[0],[0]
Finding the equivalence of arbitrary symbolic expressions is a NP-hard problem or worse.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"For example, if we focus on boolean expressions, reducing an expression to the representation of the false equivalence class amounts to proving its non-satisfiability — an NPcomplete problem.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Of course, we do not expect to circum-
vent an NP-complete problem with neural networks.",2. Model,[0],[0]
A network for solving boolean equivalence would require an exponential number of nodes in the size of the expression if P 6= NP .,2. Model,[0],[0]
"Instead, our goal is to develop architectures that efficiently learn to solve the equivalence problems for expressions that are similar to a smaller number of expressions in a given training set.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"The supplementary material shows a sample of such expressions that illustrate the hardness of this problem.
",2. Model,[0],[0]
Notation and Framework.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"To allow our representations to be compositional, we employ the general framework of recursive neural networks (TREENN)",2. Model,[0],[0]
"(Socher et al., 2012; 2013), in our case operating on tree structures of the syntactic parse of a formula.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Given a tree T , TREENNs learn distributed representations for each node in the tree by recursively combining the representations of its subtrees using a neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We denote the children of a node n as ch(n) which is a (possibly empty) ordered tuple of nodes.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"We also use par(n) to refer to the parent node of n. Each node in our tree has a type, e.g. a terminal node could be of type “a” referring to the variable a or of type “and” referring to a node of the logical AND (∧) operation.",2. Model,[0],[0]
We refer to the type of a node n as τn.,2. Model,[0],[0]
"In pseudocode, TREENNs retrieve the representation of a tree T rooted at node ρ, by invoking the function TREENN(ρ) that returns a vector representation rρ ∈ RD, i.e., a SEMVEC.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"The function is defined as TREENN (current node n)
if n is not a leaf then rn ← COMBINE(TREENN(c0), . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", TREENN(ck), τn), where (c0, . . .",2. Model,[0],[0]
", ck) = ch(n) else rn ← LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn)
return rn The general framework of TREENN allows two points of variation, the implementation of LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING and COMBINE.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) define LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING as a simple lookup operation within a matrix of embeddings and COMBINE as a single-layer neural network.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"As discussed next, these will both prove to be serious limitations in our setting.",2. Model,[0],[0]
"To train these networks to learn SEMVECs, we will use a supervised objective based on a set of known equivalence relations (see Section 2.2).",2. Model,[0],[0]
"Our domain requires that the network learns to abstract away syntax, assigning identical representations to expressions that may be syntactically different but semantically equivalent, and also assigning different representations to expressions that may be syntactically very similar but nonequivalent.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In this work, we find that standard neural architectures do not handle well this challenge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To represent semantics from syntax, we need to learn to recursively
compose and decompose semantic representations and remove syntactic “noise”.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Any syntactic operation may significantly change semantics (e.g. negation, or appending ∧FALSE) while we may reach the same semantic state through many possible operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This necessitates using high-curvature operations over the semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, some operations are semantically reversible and thus we need to learn reversible semantic representations (e.g. ¬¬A and A should have an identical SEMVECs).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Based on these, we define neural equivalence networks (EQNET), which learn to compose representations of equivalence classes into new equivalence classes (Figure 1a).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Our network follows the TREENN architecture, i.e. is implemented using TREENN to model the compositional nature of symbolic expressions but is adapted based on the domain requirements.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The extensions we introduce have two aims: first, to improve the network training; and second, and more interestingly, to encourage the learned representations to abstract away surface level information while retaining semantic content.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
The first extension that we introduce is to the network structure at each layer in the tree.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Traditional TREENNs (Socher et al., 2013) use a single-layer neural network at each tree node.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"During our preliminary investigations and in Section 3, we found that single layer networks are not adequately expressive to capture all operations that transform the input SEMVECs to the output SEMVEC and maintain semantic equivalences, requiring high-curvature operations.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Part of the problem stems from the fact that within the Euclidean space of SEMVECs some operations need to be non-linear.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
For example a simple XOR boolean operator requires high-curvature operations in the continuous semantic representation space.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Instead, we turn to multi-layer neural
networks.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In particular, we define the network as shown in the function COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
This uses a twolayer MLP with a residual-like connection to compute the SEMVEC of each parent node in that syntax tree given that of its children.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Each node type τn, e.g., each logical operator, has a different set of weights.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We experimented with deeper networks but this did not yield any improvements.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"However, as TREENNs become deeper, they suffer from optimization issues, such as diminishing and exploding gradients.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"This is essentially because of the highly compositional nature of tree structures, where the same network (i.e. the COMBINE non-linear function) is used recursively, causing it to “echo” its own errors and producing unstable feedback loops.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We observe this problem even with only two-layer MLPs, as the overall network can become quite deep when using two layers for each node in the syntax tree.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We resolve this issue in the training procedure by constraining each SEMVEC to have unit norm.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"That is, we set LOOKUPLEAFEMBEDDING(τn) = Cτn/ ‖Cτn‖2 , and we normalize the output of the final layer of COMBINE in Figure 1b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The normalization step of l̄out and Cτn is somewhat similar to weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) and vaguely resembles layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Normalizing the SEMVECs partially resolves issues with diminishing and exploding gradients, and removes a spurious degree of freedom in the semantic representation.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"As simple as this modification may seem, we found it vital for obtaining good performance, and all of our multi-layer TREENNs converged to low-performing settings without it.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although these modifications seem to improve the representation capacity of the network and its ability to be trained, we found that they were not on their own sufficient for good
performance.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In our early experiments, we noticed that the networks were primarily focusing on syntax instead of semantics, i.e., expressions that were nearby in the continuous space were primarily ones that were syntactically similar.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"At the same time, we observed that the networks did not learn to unify representations of the same equivalence class, observing multiple syntactically distinct but semantically equivalent expressions to have distant SEMVECs.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Therefore we modify the training objective in order to encourage the representations to become more abstract, reducing their dependence on surface-level syntactic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We add a regularization term on the SEMVECs that we call a subexpression autoencoder (SUBEXPAE).,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We design this regularization to encourage the SEMVECs to have two properties: abstraction and reversibility.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Because abstraction arguably means removing irrelevant information, a network with a bottleneck layer seems natural, but we want the training objective to encourage the bottleneck to discard syntactic information rather than semantic information.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To achieve this, we introduce a component that aims to encourage reversibility, which we explain by an example.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Observe that given the semantic representation of any two of the three nodes of a subexpression (by which we mean the parent, left child, right child of an expression tree)",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
it is often possible to completely determine or at least place strong constraints on the semantics of the third.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, consider a boolean formula F (a, b) = F1(a, b) ∨ F2(a, b) where F1 and F2 are arbitrary propositional formulae over the variables a, b.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then clearly if we know that F implies that a is true but F1 does not, then F2 must imply that a is true.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More generally, if F belongs to some equivalence class e0 and F1 belongs to a different class e1, we want the continuous representation of F2 to reflect that there are strong constraints on the equivalence class of F2.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Subexpression autoencoding encourages abstraction by employing an autoencoder with a bottleneck, thereby removing irrelevant information from the representations, and encourages reversibility by autoencoding the parent and child representations together, to encourage dependence in the representations of parents and children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More specifically, given any node p in the tree with children c0 . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]

What SUBEXPAE does is to autoencode this representation tuple into a low-dimensional space with a denoising autoencoder.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"We then seek to minimize the reconstruction error of the child representations (r̃c0 , . . .",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
", r̃ck ) as well as the reconstructed parent representation r̃p that can be computed from the reconstructed children.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"More formally, we minimize the return value of SUBEXPAE in Figure 1c where n is a binary noise vector with κ percent of its elements set to zero.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Note that the encoder is specific to the parent node type τp.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Although our SUBEXPAE may seem similar to the recursive autoencoders of Socher et al. (2011), it differs
in two major ways.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE autoencodes on the entire parent-children representation tuple, rather than the child representations alone.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, the encoding is not used to compute the parent representation, but only serves as a regularizer.
",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
Subexpression autoencoding has several desirable effects.,2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"First, it forces each parent-children tuple to lie in a lowdimensional space, requiring the network to compress information from the individual subexpressions.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Second, because the denoising autoencoder is reconstructing parent and child representations together, this encourages child representations to be predictable from parents and siblings.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Putting these two together, the goal is that the information discarded by the autoencoder bottleneck will be more syntactic than semantic, assuming that the semantics of child node is more predictable from its parent and sibling than its syntactic realization.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"The goal is to nudge the network to learn consistent, reversible semantics.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Additionally, subexpression autoencoding has the potential to gradually unify distant representations that belong to the same equivalence class.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"To illustrate this point, imagine two semantically equivalent c′0 and c ′′ 0 child nodes of different expressions that
have distant SEMVECs, i.e. ∥∥rc′0 − rc′′0 ∥∥2 although COMBINE(rc′0 , . . . )",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"≈ COMBINE(rc′′0 , . . . ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"In some cases due to the autoencoder noise, the differences between the input tuple x′,x′′ that contain rc′0 and rc′′0 will be non-existent and the decoder will predict a single location r̃c0 (possibly different from rc′0 and rc′′0 ).",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
"Then, when minimizing the reconstruction error, both rc′0 and rc′′0 will be attracted to r̃c0 and eventually should merge.",2.1. Neural Equivalence Networks,[0],[0]
We train EQNETs from a dataset of expressions whose semantic equivalence is known.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Given a training set T = {T1 . . .,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"TN} of parse trees of expressions, we assume that the training set is partitioned into equivalence classes E = {e1 . . .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
eJ}.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We use a supervised objective similar to classification; the difference between classification and our setting is that whereas standard classification problems consider a fixed set of class labels, in our setting the number of equivalence classes in the training set will vary with N .",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Given an expression tree T that belongs to the equivalence class ei ∈ E , we compute the probability
P (ei|T ) =",2.2. Training,[0],[0]

qej,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"+ bj
) (1) where qei are model parameters that we can interpret as representations of each equivalence class that appears in the training class, and bi are scalar bias terms.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Note that in this work, we only use information about the equivalence class of the whole expression T , ignoring available information about subexpressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"This is without loss of generality, because if we do know the equivalence class of a subexpression of T , we can simply add that subexpression to
the training set.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"To train the model, we use a max-margin objective that maximizes classification accuracy, i.e.
LACC(T, ei) = max (
0, arg max ej 6=ei,ej∈E log P (ej |T ) P (ei|T ) +m ) (2)
where m > 0 is a scalar margin.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"And therefore the optimized loss function for a single expression tree T that belongs to equivalence class ei ∈ E is
L(T, ei) = LACC(T, ei) + µ |Q| ∑ n∈Q SUBEXPAE(ch(n), n)

",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"where Q = {n ∈ T : | ch(n)| > 0}, i.e. contains the nonleaf nodes of T and µ ∈ (0, 1] a scalar weight.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"We found that subexpression autoencoding is counterproductive early in training, before the SEMVECs begin to represent aspects of semantics.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"So, for each epoch t, we set µ = 1− 10−νt with ν ≥ 0.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"Instead of the supervised objective that we propose, an alternative option for training EQNET would be a Siamese objective (Chopra et al., 2005) that learns about similarities (rather than equivalence) between expressions.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
"In practice, we found the optimization to be very unstable, yielding suboptimal performance.",2.2. Training,[0],[0]
We believe that this has to do with the compositional and recursive nature of the task that creates unstable dynamics and the fact that equivalence is a stronger property than similarity.,2.2. Training,[0],[0]
Datasets.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate datasets of expressions grouped into equivalence classes from two domains.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The datasets from the BOOL domain contain boolean expressions and the POLY datasets contain polynomial expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"In both domains, an expression is either a variable, a binary operator that combines two expressions, or a unary operator applied to a single expression.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When defining equivalence, we interpret distinct variables as referring to different entities in the domain, so that, e.g., the polynomials c · (a · a+ b) and f ·(d·d+e) are not equivalent.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For each domain, we generate “simple” datasets which use a smaller set of possible operators and “standard” datasets which use a larger set of more complex operators.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We generate each dataset by exhaustively generating all parse trees up to a maximum tree size.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
All expressions are symbolically simplified into a canonical from in order to determine their equivalence class and are grouped accordingly.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows the datasets we generated.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
In the supplementary material we present some sample expressions.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"For the polynomial domain, we also generated ONEV-POLY datasets, which are polynomials over a single variable, since they are similar to the setting considered by Zaremba et al. (2014) — although ONEV-POLY is still a little more general because it is not restricted to homogeneous polynomials.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Learning SEMVECs for boolean expressions
is already a hard problem; with n boolean variables, there are 22 n
equivalence classes (i.e. one for each possible truth table).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We split the datasets into training, validation and test sets.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We create two test sets, one to measure generalization performance on equivalence classes that were seen in the training data (SEENEQCLASS), and one to measure generalization to unseen equivalence classes (UNSEENEQCLASS).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
It is easiest to describe UNSEENEQCLASS first.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To create the UNSEENEQCLASS, we randomly select 20% of all the equivalence classes, and place all of their expressions in the test set.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We select equivalence classes only if they contain at least two expressions but less than three times the average number of expressions per equivalence class.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We thus avoid selecting very common (and hence trivial to learn) equivalence classes in the testset.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Then, to create SEENEQCLASS, we take the remaining 80% of the equivalence classes, and randomly split the expressions in each class into training, validation, SEENEQCLASS test in the proportions 60%–15%–25%.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We provide the datasets online at groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/cup/semvec.
Baselines.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To compare the performance of our model, we train the following baselines.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"TF-IDF: learns a representation given the expression tokens (variables, operators and parentheses).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
This captures topical/declarative knowledge but is unable to capture procedural knowledge.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
GRU refers to the token-level gated recurrent unit encoder of Bahdanau et al. (2015) that encodes the token-sequence of an expression into a distributed representation.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
Stack-augmented RNN refers to the work of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) which was used to learn algorithmic patterns and uses a stack as a memory and operates on the expression tokens.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
We also include two recursive neural networks (TREENN).,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The 1- layer TREENN which is the original TREENN also used by Zaremba et al. (2014).,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also include a 2-layer TREENN, where COMBINE is a classic two-layer MLP without residual connections.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This shows the effect of SEMVEC normalization and subexpression autoencoder.
Hyperparameters.",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We tune the hyperparameters of all models using Bayesian optimization (Snoek et al., 2012) on a boolean dataset with 5 variables and maximum tree size of 7 (not shown in Table 1) using the average k-NN (k = 1, . . .",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
", 15) statistics (described next).",3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
The selected hyperparameters are detailed in the supplementary material.,3. Evaluation,[0],[0]
Metrics.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
To evaluate the quality of the learned representations we count the proportion of k nearest neighbors of each expression (using cosine similarity) that belong to the same equivalence class.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"More formally, given a test query expression q in an equivalence class c we find the k nearest neighbors Nk(q) of q across all expressions, and define the
score as
scorek(q) = |Nk(q) ∩ c| min(k, |c|) .",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"(4)
To report results for a given testset, we simply average scorek(q) for all expressions q in the testset.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also report the precision-recall curves for the problem of clustering the SEMVECs into their appropriate equivalence classes.

Detailed plots are found in the supplementary material.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"EQNET performs better for all datasets, by a large margin.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The only exception is POLY5, where the 2-L TREENN performs better.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, this may have to do with the small size of the dataset.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The reader may observe that the simple datasets (containing fewer operations and variables) are easier to learn.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Understandably, introducing more variables increases the size of the represented space reducing performance.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The tf-idf method performs better in settings with more variables, because it captures well the variables and operations used.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Similar observations can be made for sequence models.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The one and two layer TREENNs have mixed performance; we believe that this has to do with exploding and diminishing gradients due to the deep and highly compositional nature of TREENNs.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Although Zaremba et al. (2014) consider a different problem to us, they use data similar to the ONEV-POLY datasets with a traditional TREENN architecture.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Our evaluation suggests that EQNETs perform much better within the ONEV-POLY setting.
",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Evaluation of Compositionality.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We evaluate whether EQNETs successfully learn to compute compositional representations, rather than overfitting to expression trees of
a small size.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To do this we consider a type of transfer setting, in which we train on simpler datasets, but test on more complex ones; for example, training on the training set of BOOL5 but testing on the testset of BOOL8.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
We average over 11 different train-test pairs (full list in supplementary material) and show the results in Figure 3a and Figure 3b.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"These graphs again show that EQNETs are better than any of the other methods, and indeed, performance is only a bit worse than in the non-transfer setting.
",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Impact of EQNET Components EQNETs differ from traditional TREENNs in two major ways, which we analyze here.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"First, SUBEXPAE improves performance.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"When training the network with and without SUBEXPAE, on average, the area under the curve (AUC) of scorek decreases by 16.8% on the SEENEQCLASS and 19.7% on the UNSEENEQCLASS.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This difference is smaller in the transfer setting, where AUC decreases by 8.8% on average.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"However, even in this setting we observe that SUBEXPAE helps more in large and diverse datasets.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
The second key difference to traditional TREENNs is the output normalization and the residual connections.,3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Comparing our model to the one-layer and two-layer TREENNs again, we find that output normalization results in important improvements (the two-layer TREENNs have on average 60.9% smaller AUC).",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We note that only the combination of the residual connections and the output normalization improve the performance, whereas when used separately, there are no significant improvements over the two-layer TREENNs.",3.1. Quantitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows expressions whose SEMVEC nearest neighbor is of an expression of another equivalence class.,3.2. Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Manually inspecting boolean expressions, we find that EQNET confusions happen more when a XOR or implication operator is
Table 2.",3.2. Qualitative Evaluation,[0],[0]

A key barrier for crosslingual transfer is lexical matching between the source and the target language.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Crosslingual word embeddings are a natural remedy where both source and target language lexicon are presented as dense vectors in the same vector space (Klementiev et al., 2012).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Most previous work has focused on down-stream crosslingual applications such as document classification and dependency parsing.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We argue that good crosslingual embeddings should preserve both monolingual and crosslingual quality which we will use as the main evaluation criterion through monolingual word similarity and bilingual lexicon induction tasks.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, many prior work (Chandar A P et al., 2014; Kočiský et al., 2014) used bilingual or comparable corpus which is also expensive for many low-resource languages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Søgaard et al. (2015) impose a less onerous data condition in the form of linked Wikipedia entries across several languages, however this approach tends to underperform other methods.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To capture the monolingual distributional properties of words it is crucial to train on large monolingual corpora (Luong et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, many previous approaches are not capable of scaling up either because of the complicated objective functions or the nature of the algorithm.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Other methods use a dictionary as the bridge between languages (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Xiao and Guo, 2014), however they do not adequately handle translation ambiguity.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model uses a bilingual dictionary from Panlex (Kamholz et al., 2014) as the source of bilingual signal.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Panlex covers more than a thousand languages and therefore our approach applies to many languages, including low-resource languages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our method selects the translation based on the context in an Expectation-Maximization style training algorithm which explicitly handles polysemy through incorporating multiple dictionary translations (word sense and translation are closely linked (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999)).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Our approach is an extension of the continuous bag-ofwords (CBOW) model (Mikolov et al., 2013b) to inject multilingual training signal based on dictionary translations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We experiment with several variations of our model, whereby we predict only the translation or both word and its translation and consider different ways of using the different learned center-word versus context embeddings in application tasks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We also propose a regularisation method to combine the two embedding matrices during training.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Together, these modifications substantially improve the performance across several tasks.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

• Proposing a new crosslingual training method for learning vector embeddings, based only on monolingual corpora and a bilingual dictionary;
• Evaluating several methods for combining embeddings, which are shown to help in both crosslingual and monolingual evaluations; and

"There is a wealth of prior work on crosslingual word embeddings, which all exploit some kind of bilingual resource.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"This is often in the form of a parallel bilingual text, using word alignments as a bridge between tokens in the source and target languages, such that translations are assigned similar embedding vectors (Luong et al., 2015; Klementiev et al., 2012).",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"These approaches are affected by errors from automatic word alignments, motivating other approaches which operate at the sentence level (Chandar A P et al., 2014; Hermann and Blunsom, 2014; Gouws et al., 2015) through learning compositional vector representations of sentences,
in order that sentences and their translations representations closely match.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"The word embeddings learned this way capture translational equivalence, despite not using explicit word alignments.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Nevertheless, these approaches demand large parallel corpora, which are not available for many language pairs.
Vulić and Moens (2015) use bilingual comparable text, sourced from Wikipedia.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Their approach creates a psuedo-document by forming a bag-ofwords from the lemmatized nouns in each comparable document concatenated over both languages.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
These pseudo-documents are then used for learning vector representations using Word2Vec.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Their system, despite its simplicity, performed surprisingly well on a bilingual lexicon induction task (we compare our method with theirs on this task.)",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Their approach is compelling due to its lesser resource requirements, although comparable bilingual data is scarce for many languages.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Related, Søgaard et al. (2015) exploit the comparable part of Wikipedia.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"They represent word using Wikipedia entries which are shared for many languages.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
A bilingual dictionary is an alternative source of bilingual information.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Gouws and Søgaard (2015) randomly replace the text in a monolingual corpus with a random translation, using this corpus for learning word embeddings.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Their approach doesn’t handle polysemy, as very few of the translations for each word will be valid in context.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
For this reason a high coverage or noisy dictionary with many translations might lead to poor outcomes.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Mikolov et al. (2013a), Xiao and Guo (2014) and Faruqui and Dyer (2014) filter a bilingual dictionary for one-to-one translations, thus side-stepping the problem, however discarding much of the information in the dictionary.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our approach also uses a dictionary, however we use all the translations and explicitly disambiguate translations during training.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Another distinguishing feature on the above-cited research is the method for training embeddings.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
Mikolov et al. (2013a) and Faruqui and Dyer (2014) use a cascade style of training where the word embeddings in both source and target language are trained separately and then combined later using the dictionary.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Most of the other works train multlingual models jointly, which appears to have better performance over cascade training (Gouws et al., 2015).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
For this reason we also use a form of joint training in our work.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Our model is an extension of the contextual bag of words (CBOW) model of Mikolov et al. (2013b), a method for learning vector representations of words based on their distributional contexts.",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"Specifically, their model describes the probability of a token wi at position i using logistic regression with a factored parameterisation,
p(wi|wi±k\i) = exp(u>wihi)∑ w∈W exp(u > whi) , (1)
where hi = 12k ∑k
j=−k;j",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
6=0 vwi+j is a vector encoding the context over a window of size k centred around position,3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"i, W is the vocabulary and the parameters V and U ∈ R|W |×d are matrices referred to as the context and word embeddings.",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"The model is trained to maximise the log-pseudo likelihood of a training corpus, however due to the high complexity of computing the denominator of equation (1), Mikolov et al. (2013b) propose negative sampling as an approximation, by instead learning to differentiate data from noise (negative examples).",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"This gives rise to the following optimisation objective
∑
i∈D
( log σ(u>wihi)+",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"p∑
j=1
Ewj∼Pn(w) log σ(−u>wjhi) ) ,
(2) where D is the training data and p is the number of negative examples randomly drawn from a noise distribution Pn(w).",3 Word2Vec,[0],[0]
"Our approach extends CBOW to model bilingual text, using two monolingual corpora and a bilingual dictionary.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
We believe this data condition to be less stringent than requiring parallel or comparable texts as the source of the bilingual signal.,4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"It is common for field linguists to construct a bilingual dictionary when studying a new language, as one of the first steps in the language documentation process.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"Translation dictionaries are a rich information source, capturing much of the lexical ambiguity in a language through translation.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"For example, the word bank in English might mean the river bank

",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"1: randomly initialize V, U 2: for i < Iter do 3: for i ∈ De ∪Df do 4: s← vwi",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]

or financial bank which corresponds to two different translations sponda and banca in Italian.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"If we are able to learn to select good translations, then this implicitly resolves much of the semantic ambiguity in the language, and accordingly we seek to use this idea to learn better semantic vector representations of words.",4 Our Approach,[0],[0]
"To learn bilingual relations, we use the context in one language to predict the translation of the centre word in another language.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
This is motivated by the fact that the context is an excellent means of disambiguating the translation for a word.,4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"Our method is closely related to Gouws and Søgaard (2015), however we only replace the middle word wi with a translation w̄i while keeping the context fixed.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"We replace each centre word with a translation on the fly during training, predicting instead p(w̄i|wi±k\i) but using the same formulation as equation (1) albeit with an augmented U matrix to cover word types in both languages.
",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
The translation w̄i is selected from the possible translations of wi listed in the dictionary.,4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"The problem of selecting the correct translation from the many options is reminiscent of the problem faced in expectation maximisation (EM), in that crosslingual word embeddings will allow for accurate translation, however to learn these embeddings we need to know the translations.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"We propose an EMinspired algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 1, which operates over both monolingual corpora, De and Df .",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
"The vector s is the semantic representation combining both the centre word, wi, and the con-
text,1 which is used to choose the best translation into the other language from the bilingual dictionary dict(wi).2 After selecting the translation, we use w̄i together with the context vector h to make a stochastic gradient update of the CBOW log-likelihood.",4.1 Dictionary replacement,[0],[0]
Words and their translations should appear in very similar contexts.,4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
One way to enforce this is to jointly learn to predict both the word and its translation from its monolingual context.,4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
"This gives rise to the following joint objective function,
O = ∑
i∈De∪Df
( α log σ(u>wihi)+(1−α) log σ(u>w̄ihi)
+
p∑
j=1
Ewj∼Pn(w) log σ(−u>wjhi) ) , (3)
where α controls the contribution of the two terms.",4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
"For our experiments, we set α = 0.5.",4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
The negative examples are drawn from combined vocabulary unigram distribution calculated from combined data De ∪Df .,4.2 Joint Training,[0],[0]
Many vector learning methods learn two embedding spaces V and U. Usually only V is used in application.,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"The use of U, on the other hand, is understudied (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) with the exception of Pennington et al. (2014) who use a linear combination U + V, with minor improvement over V alone.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"We argue that with our model, V is better at capturing the monolingual regularities and U is better at capturing bilingual signal.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
The intuition for this is as follows.,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Assuming that we are predicting the word finance and its Italian translation finanze from the context (money, loan, bank, debt, credit) as shown in figure 1.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"In V only the context word representations are updated and in U only the representations of finance, finanze and negative samples such as tree and dog are updated.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"CBOW learns good embeddings because each time it updates the parameters, the words in the contexts are pushed closer to each
1Using both embeddings gives a small improvement compared to just using context vector h alone.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"2We also experimented with using expectations over translations, as per standard EM, with slight degredation in results.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
other in the V space.,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Similarly, the target word wi and the translation w̄i are also pushed closer in the U space.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
This is directly related to poitwise mutual information values of each pair of word and context explained in Levy and Goldberg (2014).,4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Thus, U is bound to better at bilingual lexicon induction task and V is better at monolingual word similarity task.
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"The simple question is, how to combine both V and U to produce a better representation.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"We experiment with several ways to combine V and U. First, we can follow Pennington et al. (2014) to interpolate V and U in the post-processing step.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"i.e.
γV +",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"(1− γ)U (4)
where γ controls the contribution of each embedding space.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Second, we can also concatenate V and U instead of interpolation such that C =",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"[V : U] where C ∈ R|W |×2d and W is the combined vocabulary from De ∪Df .
",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we can also fuse V and U during training.",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"For each word in the combined dictionary Ve ∪ Vf , we encourage the model to learn similar representation in both V and U by adding a regularization term to the objective function in equation (3) during training.
O′ =",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"O + δ ∑
w∈Ve∪Vf ‖uw − vw‖22 (5)
where δ controls to what degree we should bind two spaces together.3",4.3 Combining Embeddings,[0],[0]
"Our experimental evaluation seeks to determine how well lexical distances in the learned embedding
3In the stochastic gradient update for a given word in context, we only compute the gradient of the regularisation term in (5) with respect to the words in the set of positive and negative examples.
",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
spaces match with known lexical similarity judgements from bilingual and monolingual lexical resources.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"To this end, in §6 we test crosslingual distances using a bilingual lexicon induction task in which we evaluate the embeddings in terms of how well nearby pairs of words from two languages in the embedding space match with human judgements.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Next, to evaluate the monolingual embeddings we evaluate word similarities in a single language against standard similarity datasets (§7).",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Lastly, to demonstrate the usefulness of our embeddings in a task-based setting, we evaluate on crosslingual document classification (§9).
",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Monolingual Data,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The monolingual data is taken from the pre-processed Wikipedia dump from AlRfou et al. (2013).,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The data is already cleaned and tokenized.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We additionally lower-case all words.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Normally monolingual word embeddings are trained on billions of words.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"However, obtaining that much monolingual data for a low-resource language is infeasible.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we only select the first 5 million sentences (around 100 million words) for each language.
",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Dictionary A bilingual dictionary is the only source of bilingual correspondence in our technique.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We prefer a dictionary that covers many languages, such that our approach can be applied widely to many low-resource languages.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We use Panlex, a dictionary which currently covers around 1300 language varieties with about 12 million expressions.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The translations in PanLex come from various sources such as glossaries, dictionaries, automatic inference from other languages, etc.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Accordingly, Panlex has high language coverage but often noisy translations.4 Table 1 summarizes the sizes of monolingual corpora and dictionaries for each pair of language in our experiments.
",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
4We also experimented with a crowd-sourced dictionary from Wiktionary.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
Our initial observation was that the translation quality was better but with a lower-coverage.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"For example, for en-it dictionary, Panlex and Wiktionary have a coverage of 42.1% and 16.8% respectively for the top 100k most frequent English words from Wikipedia.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The average number of translations are 5.2 and 1.9 respectively.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We observed similar trend using Panlex and Wiktionary dictionary in our model.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"However, using Panlex results in much better performance.",5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
We can run the model on the combined dictionary from both Panlex and Wiktionary but we leave it for future work.,5 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Given a word in a source language, the bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) task is to predict its translation in the target language.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Vulić and Moens (2015) proposed this task to test crosslingual word embeddings.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
The difficulty of this is that it is evaluated using the recall of the top ranked word.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"The model must be very discriminative in order to score well.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"We build the CLWE for 3 language pairs: it-en, es-en and nl-en, using similar parameters setting with Vulić and Moens (2015).5 The remaining tunable parameters in our system are δ from Equation (5), and the choice of algorithm for combining embeddings.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"We use the regularization technique from §4.3 for combining context and word embeddings with δ = 0.01, and word embeddings U are used as the output for all experiments (but see comparative experiments in §8.)
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Qualitative evaluation We jointly train the model to predict both wi and the translation w̄i, combine V and U during training for each language pair.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Table 2 shows the top 10 closest words in both source and target languages according to cosine similarity.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Note that the model correctly identifies the translation in en as the top candidate, and the top 10 words in both source and target languages are highly related.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"This qualitative evaluation initially demonstrates the ability of our CLWE to capture both the bilingual and monolingual relationship.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Quantitative evaluation Table 3 shows our results compared with prior work.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"We reimple-
5Default learning rate of 0.025, negative sampling with 25 samples, subsampling rate of value 1e−4, embedding dimension d = 200, window size cs = 48 and run for 15 epochs.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
ment Gouws and Søgaard (2015) using Panlex and Wiktionary dictionaries.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
The result with Panlex is substantially worse than with Wiktionary.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
This confirms our hypothesis in §2.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"That is the context might be corrupted if we just randomly replace the training data with the translation from noisy dictionary such as Panlex.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Our model when randomly picking the translation is similar to Gouws and Søgaard (2015), using the Panlex dictionary.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
The biggest difference is that they replace the training data (both context and middle word) while we fix the context and only replace the middle word.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"For a high coverage yet noisy dictionary such as Panlex, our approach gives better average score.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Comparing our two most basic models (EM selection and random selection), it is clear that the model using EM to select the translation outperforms random selection by a significant margin.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Our joint model, as described in equation (3) which predicts both target word and the translation, further improves the performance, especially for nl-en.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
We use equation (5) to combine both context embeddings V and word embeddings U for all three language pairs.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
This modification during training substantially improves the performance.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"More importantly, all our improvements are consistent for all three language pairs and both evaluation metrics, showing the robustness of our models.
",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Our combined model out-performed previous approaches by a large margin.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Vulić and Moens (2015)
used bilingual comparable data, but this might be hard to obtain for some language pairs.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Their performance on nl-en is poor because their comparable data between en and nl is small.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"Besides, they also use POS tagger and lemmatizer to filter only Noun and reduce the morphology complexity during training.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
These tools might not be available for many languages.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"For a fairer comparison to their work, we also use the same Treetagger (Schmid, 1995) to lemmatize the output of our combined model before evaluation.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Table 3 (+lemmatization) shows some improvements but minor.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
It demonstrates that our model is already good at disambiguating morphology.,6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
"For example, the top 2 translations for es word lenguas in en are languages and language which correctly prefer the plural translation.",6 Bilingual Lexicon Induction,[0],[0]
Now we consider the efficacy of our CLWE on monolingual word similarity.,7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"We evaluate on English monolingual similarity on WordSim353 (WSen), RareWord (RW-en) and German version of WordSim353 (WS-de) (Finkelstein et al., 2001; Luong et al., 2013; Luong et al., 2015).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Each of those datasets contain many tuples (w1, w2,s) where s is a scalar denoting the semantic similarity between w1 and w2 given by human annotators.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Good system should produce the score correlated with human judgement.
",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"We train the model as described in §4, which is the combine embeddings setting from Table 3.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Since the evaluation involves de and en word similarity, we train the CLWE for en-de pair.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
Table 4 shows the performance of our combined model compared with several baselines.,7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Our combined model out-performed both Luong et al. (2015) and Gouws and Søgaard (2015)6 which represent the best published crosslingual embeddings trained on bitext and monolingual data respectively.
",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"We also compare our system with the monolingual CBOW model trained on the monolingual data for each language, using the same parameter settings from earlier (§6).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Surprisingly, our combined model performs better than the monolingual CBOW baseline which makes our result close to the monolingual state-of-the-art on each different dataset.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"However, the best monolingual methods use much larger
6trained using the Panlex dictionary
monolingual corpora (Shazeer et al., 2016), WordNet or the output of commercial search engines (Yih and Qazvinian, 2012).
",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
Next we explain the gain of our combined model compared with the monolingual CBOW model.,7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"First, we compare the combined model with the joint-model with respect to monolingual CBOW model (Table 4).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"It shows that the improvement seems mostly come from combining V and U. If we apply the combining algorithm to the monolingual CBOW model (CBOW + combine), we also ob-
serve an improvement.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Clearly most of the improvement is from combining V and U, however our V and U are more complementary as the gain is more marked.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"Other improvements can be explained by the observation that a dictionary can improve monolingual accuracy through linking synonyms (Faruqui and Dyer, 2014).",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
"For example, since plane, airplane and aircraft have the same Italian translation aereo, the model will encourage those words to be closer in the embedding space.",7 Monolingual Word Similarity,[0],[0]
Combining context embeddings and word embeddings results in an improvement in both monolingual similarity and bilingual lexicon induction.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"In §4.3, we introduce several combination methods including post-processing (interpolation and concatenation) and during training (regularization).",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"In this section, we justify our parameter and model choices.
",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"We use en-it pair for tuning purposes, considering the value of γ in equation 4.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
Figure 2 shows the performances using different values of γ.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
The two extremes where γ = 0 and γ = 1 corresponds to no interpolation where we just use U or V respectively.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"As γ increases, the performance on WSen increases yet BLI decreases.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
These results confirm our hypothesis in §4.3 that U is better at capturing bilingual relations and V is better at capturing monolingual relations.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"As a compromise, we choose γ = 0.5 in our experiments.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"Similarly, we tune the regularization sensitivity δ in equation (5) which combines embeddings space during training.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"We test δ = 10−n with n = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and us-
ing V, U or the interpolation of both V+U2 as the learned embeddings, evaluated on the same BLI and WS-en.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"We select δ = 0.01.
",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
Table 5 shows the performance with and without using combining algorithms mentioned in §4.3.,8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"As the compromise between both monolingual and crosslingual tasks, we choose regularization + U as the combination algorithm.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"All in all, we apply the regularization algorithm for combining V and U with δ = 0.01 and U as the output for all language pairs without further tuning.",8 Model selection,[0],[0]
"In this section, we evaluate our CLWE on a downstream crosslingual document classification (CLDC)
task.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"In this task, the document classifier is trained on a source language and then applied directly to classify a document in the target language.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
This is convenient for a target low-resource language where we do not have document annotations.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"The experimental setup is the same as Klementiev et al. (2012)7 with the training and testing data sourced from Reuter RCV1/RCV2 corpus (Lewis et al., 2004).
",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
The documents are represented as the bag of word embeddings weighted by tf.idf.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
A multi-class classifier is trained using the average perceptron algorithm on 1000 documents in the source language and tested on 5000 documents in the target language.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"We use the CLWE, such that the document representation in the target language embeddings is in the same space with the source language.
",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
We build the en-de CLWE using combined models as described in section §4.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Following prior work, we also use monolingual data8 from the RCV1/RCV2 corpus (Klementiev et al., 2012; Gouws et al., 2015; Chandar A P et al., 2014).

Table 6 shows the CLDC results for various CLWE.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Despite its simplicity, our model achieves competitive performance.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Note that aside from our model, all other models in Table 6 use a large bitext (Europarl) which may not exist for many lowresource languages, limiting their applicability.
7The data split and code are kindly provided by the authors.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
8We randomly sample documents in RCV1 and RCV2 corpora and selected around 85k documents to form 400k monolingual sentences for both en and de.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"For each document, we perform basic pre-processing including: lower-casing, remove html tags and tokenization.",9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
These monolingual data are then concatenated with the monolingual data from Wikipedia to form the final training data.,9 Crosslingual Document Classification,[0],[0]
"Our model exploits dictionaries, which are more widely available than parallel corpora.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"However the question remains as to how well this performs of a real low-resource language, rather than a simulated condition like above, whereupon the quality of the dictionary is likely to be worse.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"To test this, we evaluation on Serbian, a language with few annotated language resources.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
Table 1 shows the relative size of monolingual data and dictionary for en-sr compared with other language pairs.,10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
Both the Serbian monolingual data and the dictionary size is more than 10 times smaller than other language pairs.,10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
We build the en-sr CLWE using our best model (joint + combine) and evaluate on the bilingual word induction task using 939 gold translation pairs.9 We achieved recall score of 35.8% and 45.5% at 1 and 5 respectively.,10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"Although worse than the earlier results, these numbers are still well above chance.
",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
We can also simulate low-resource setting using our earlier datasets.,10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"For estimating the performance loss on all three tasks, we down sample the dictionary for en-it and en-de based on en word frequency.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
Figure 3 shows the performance with different dictionary sizes for all three tasks.,10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
The monolingual similarity performance is very similar across various sizes.,10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"For BLI and CLDC, dictionary size is more important, although performance levels off at around 80k dictionary pairs.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
"We conclude that this size is sufficient for decent performance.

"9The sr→en translations are sourced from Google Translate by translating one word at a time, followed by manually verification, after which 61 translation pairs were ruled out as being bad or questionable.",10 Low-resource languages,[0],[0]
Previous CLWE methods often impose high resource requirements yet have low accuracy.,11 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We introduce a simple framework based on a large noisy dictionary.,11 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We model polysemy using EM translation selection during training to learn bilingual correspondences from monolingual corpora.,11 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Our algorithm allows to train on massive amount of monolingual data efficiently, representing monolingual and bilingual properties of language.",11 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on bilingual lexicon induction task, competitive result on monolingual word similarity and crosslingual document classification task.",11 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"Although WNN is able to reduce the number of training iterations and improve generalization, it comes with a price of increasing training time, because eigen-decomposition occupies large computations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The runtime scales up when the number of hidden layers that require whitening transformation increases.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We revisit WNN by breaking down its performance and show that its main runtime comes from two aspects, 1) computing full covariance matrix for whitening and 2) solving singular value decomposition (SVD).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Previous work (Desjardins et al., 2015) suggests to overcome these problems by a) using a subset of training data to estimate the full covariance matrix and b) solving the SVD every hundreds or thousands of training iterations.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Both of them rely on the assumption that the SVD holds in this period, but it is generally not true.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"When this period becomes large, WNN degenerates to canonical SGD due to ill conditioning of FIM.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We propose generalized WNN (GWNN), which possesses the beneficial properties of WNN, but significantly reduces its runtime and improves its generalization.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We introduce two variants of GWNN, including pre-whitening and postwhitening GWNNs.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The former one whitens a hidden layer’s input values, whilst the latter one whitens the preactivation values (hidden features).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
GWNN has three appealing characteristics.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, compared to WNN, GWNN is capable of learning more compact hidden representation, such that the SVD can be approximated by a few top eigenvectors to reduce computation.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This compact representation also improves generalization.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, it enables the whitening transformation to be performed in a short period, maintaining conditioning of FIM.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third, by exploiting knowledge of the distribution of the hidden features, we calculate the covariance matrix in an analytical form to further improve computational efficiency.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We begin by defining the basic notation for feed-forward neural network.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
A neural network transforms an input vector o0 to an output vector o` through a series of ` hidden layers {oi}`i=1.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
We assume each layer has identical dimension for the simplicity of notation i.e. ∀oi ∈ Rd×1.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"In this case, all vectors and matrixes in the following should have d rows unless otherwise stated.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"As shown in Fig.1 (a), each fully-connected (fc) layer consists of a weight matrix, W i, and a set of hidden neurons, hi, each of which receives as input a weighted sum of outputs from the previous layer.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
We have hi = W ioi−1.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"In this work, we take fully-connected network as an example.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"Note that the above computation can be also applied to a convolutional network, where an image patch is vectorized as a column vector and represented by oi−1 and each row of W i represents a filter.
",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"As the recent deep architectures typically stack a batch normalization (BN) layer before the pre-activation values, we do not explicitly include a bias term when computing hi, because it is normalized in BN, such that φi = hi−E[hi]√
Var[hi] , where the expectation and variance are computed over a minibatch of samples.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
LeCun et al. (2002) showed that such normalization speeds up convergence even when the hidden features are not decorrelated.,2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, output of each layer is calculated by a nonlinear activation function.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"A popular choice is the rectified linear unit, relu(x) = max(0, x).",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
"The precise computation for an output is oi = max(0,diag(αi)φi + βi), where diag(x) represents a matrix whose diagonal entries are x. αi and βi are two vectors that scale and shift the normalized features, in order to maintain the network’s representation capacity.",2. Notation and Background,[0],[0]
This section revisits whitened neural networks (WNN).,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
Any neural architecture can be adapted to a WNN by stacking a whitening transformation layer after the layer’s input.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, Fig.1 (b) adapts a fc layer as shown in
(a) into a whitened fc layer.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Its information flow becomes

where µi−1 represents a centering variable, µi−1 = E[oi−1].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"P i−1 is a whitening matrix whose rows are obtained from eigen-decomposition of Σi−1, which is the covariance matrix of the input, Σi−1 = E[(oi−1 − µi−1)(oi−1 − µi−1)T].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"The input is decorrelated by P i−1 in the sense that its covariance matrix becomes an identity matrix, i.e. E[õi−1õi−1T ] = I .",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"To avoid ambiguity, we use ‘ˆ’ to distinguish the variables in WNN and the canonical fc layer whenever necessary.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For instance, Ŵ i represents a whitened weight matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In Eqn.(1), computation of the BN layer has been simplified because we have E[ĥi] = Ŵ iP i−1(E[oi−1]− µi−1) = 0.
",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We define θ to be a vector consisting of all the whitened weight matrixes concatenated together, θ = {vec(Ŵ 1)T, vec(Ŵ 2)T, ..., vec(Ŵ `)T}, where vec(·) is an operator that vectorizes a matrix by stacking its columns.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]

"The second constraint, hi − E[hi] = ĥi, enforces that the centered hidden features are the same, before and after

Conditioning of the FIM.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Here we show that WNN improves training efficiency by conditioning the Fisher information matrix (FIM) (Amari & Nagaoka, 2000).",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"A FIM, denoted as F , consists of `× ` blocks.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Each block is indexed by Fij , representing the covariance (co-adaptation) between the whitened weight matrixes of the i-th and j-th layers.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We have Fij = E[vec(δŴ i)vec(δŴ j)T], where δŴ i indicates the gradient of the i-th whitened weight matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, the gradient of Ŵ i is achieved by õi−1(δĥi)T, as illustrated in Eqn.(1).",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We have vec(δŴ i) = vec(õi−1(δĥi)T) = δĥi ⊗ õi−1, where ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In this case, Fij can be rewritten as E[(δĥi ⊗ õi−1)(δĥj ⊗ õj−1)T] = E[δĥi(δĥj)T ⊗ õi−1(õj−1)T].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"By assuming δĥ and õ are independent as demonstrated in (Raiko et al., 2012), Fij can be approximated by E[δĥi(δĥj)T] ⊗ E[õi−1(õj−1)T].",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"As a result, when i = j, each diagonal block of F , Fii, has a block diagonal structure because we have E[õi−1(õi−1)T] = I as shown in Eqn.(2), which improves conditioning of FIM and thus speeds up training.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In general, WNN regularizes the diagonal blocks of FIM and achieves stronger conditioning than those methods (LeCun et al., 2002; Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) that regularized the diagonal entries.

Training WNN.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
Alg.1 summarizes training of WNN.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"At the 1st line, the whitened weight matrix Ŵ i0 is initialized by W i of the ordinary fc layer, which can be pretrained or sampled from a Gaussian distribution.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
The 4th line shows that Ŵ it is updated in each iteration t using SGD.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
The first and second constraints are achieved in the 7th and 8th lines respectively.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, the 8th line ensures that the hidden features are the same before and after updating the whitening matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"As the distribution of the hidden representation changes after every update of the whitened weight matrix, to maintain good conditioning of FIM, the whitening matrix, P i−1, needs to be reconstructed frequently by performing eigen-decomposition on Σi−1, which is estimated using N samples.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
N is typically 104 in experiments.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]

"We measure the similarity of the covariance matrix, E[õi−1(õi−1)T], with the identity matrix I .",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
This is called the orthogonality.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
We employ Pearson’s correlation1 as the similarity between two matrixes.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, this measure has a value between −1 and +1, representing negative and positive correlations.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
Larger values indicate higher orthogonality.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Fig.2 visualizes four randomly generated covariance matrixes, where (a,b) are sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Fig.2 (c,d) are generated by truncating different numbers of columns of a randomly generated orthogonal matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For instance, (a,b) have small similarity with respect to the identity matrix.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In contrast, when the correlation equals 0.65 as shown in (c), all entries in the diagonal are larger than 0.9 and more than 80% off-diagonal entries have values smaller than 0.1.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation is insensitive to the size of matrix, such that orthogonality of different layers can be compared together.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"For example, although matrixes in
1Given an identity matrix, I , and a covariance matrix, Σ, the Pearson’s correlation between them is defined as corr(Σ, I) = vec(Σ)Tvec(I)√ vec(Σ)Tvec(Σ)·vec(I)Tvec(I) , where vec(Σ) is a normalized vector by subtracting mean of all entries.
",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"(a) and (b) have different sizes, they have similar value of orthogonality when they are sampled from the same distribution.
",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"As shown in Fig.3 (a), we adopt network-in-network (NIN) (Lin et al., 2014) that is trained on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009), and plot the orthogonalities of three different convolutional layers, which are whitened every τ",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
= 103 iterations by using Alg.1.,2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"We see that orthogonality values during training have large fluctuations except those of the first convolutional layer, abbreviated as ‘conv1’.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"This is because the distributions of deeper layers’ inputs change after the whitened weight matrixes have been updated, leading to ill-conditions of the whitening matrixes, which are estimated in a large interval.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"In fact, large τ will degenerate WNN to canonical SGD.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"However, ‘conv1’ uses image data as inputs, whose distribution is typically stable during training.",2.1. Whitened Neural Networks,[0],[0]
"Its whitening matrix can be estimated once at the beginning and fixed in the entire training stage.

"When adapting a fc layer to pre-GWNN, the whitening matrix is truncated by removing those eigenvectors that have small eigenvalues, in order to learn compact representation.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]

The main modification is produced at the 7th line in order to reduce runtime.,3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
"Although Alg.1 decreases number of iterations when training converged, each iteration has additional computation time for eigen-decomposition.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
"For example, in WNN, the required computation of full singular value decomposition (SVD) is typically O(Nd2), where N represents the number of samples employed to estimate the covariance matrix.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
"In particular, when we have ` whitened layers and T is the number of iterations, all whitening transformations occupy O(Nd
2T` τ ) runtime in
the entire training stage.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
"In contrast, pre-GWNN performs the popular online estimation for the top d′ eigenvectors in P i−1d′ such as online SVD (Shamir, 2015; Povey et al., 2015), instead of using full SVD as WNN did.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
"This difference reduces runtime to O( (N+M)d

represents the whitening interval in GWNN and M is the number of samples used to estimate the top eigenvectors.",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]

"For pre-GWNN, reducing runtime and improving conditioning is a tradeoff, since the former requires to increase τ ′",3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
but the latter requires to decrease it.,3.1. Pre-whitening GWNN,[0],[0]
"When M = N and d′ = d2 , we compare the runtime complexity of preGWNN to that of WNN, and obtain a ratio of dτ ′

ing theory for the ResNet architectures which simultaneously creates a new technique for boosting over features (in contrast to labels) and provides a new algorithm for ResNet-style architectures. Our proposed training algorithm, BoostResNet, is particularly suitable in nondifferentiable architectures. Our method only requires the relatively inexpensive sequential training of T “shallow ResNets”. We prove that the training error decays exponentially with the depth T if the weak module classifiers that we train perform slightly better than some weak baseline. In other words, we propose a weak learning condition and prove a boosting theory for ResNet under the weak learning condition. A generalization error bound based on margin theory is proved and suggests that ResNet could be resistant to overfitting using a network with l1 norm bounded weights.",text,[0],[0]
