17	15	In the first category, there has been a line of work (see Bartolucci et al., 2007, and references therein) on designing parametrized odds ratio based models.
19	20	However, the parametric form of these models are complex, and have a large number of parameters, and so do not necessarily scale to highdimensional settings.
23	44	But even with this modeling assumption, the likelihood of the observed ordinal random vector is not available in closed-form, is considerably complex due to the presence a multi-dimensional integral, and in particular is non-convex, so that learning the model given just the ordinal observations is typically computationally intractable.
28	23	Although these approaches are computationally very efficient they do not provide consistent estimates in high dimensional settings.
30	13	In this paper, we develop multivariate ordinal graphical model distributions, for which the estimators are computationally tractable.
33	25	Towards this, we leverage the line of work in Yang et al. (2012), which provides a mechanism to extend a univariate distribution to a multivariate graphical model distribution, by using the univariate distributions to specify node-conditional distributions.
41	10	Here, we leverage the structure of the ordinal data, and provide a very simple multistage estimator along the lines of Muthén (1984); Jöreskog (1994), that finesses computing the likelihood, and accordingly is computationally tractable, but interestingly, also comes with strong statistical guarantees.
43	37	In the first part of the paper, we investigate the approach of Yang et al. (2012) i.e., specifying node-conditional distributions via classical univariate ordinal distributions, and then exploring the corresponding joint distribution via Hammersley-Clifford-esque analyses.
44	31	The most popular class of univariate ordinal distributions rely on a generative model that quantizes a latent variable.
45	64	Suppose we have a real-valued latent random variable Z 2 R with CDF denoted by P[Z  z] = g(z µ), where µ is a location parameter of the distribution.
46	38	Suppose that the ordinal random variable Y 2 {0, .
50	18	In this case, the distribution above can also be expressed in a more compact form in terms of log-odds ratios as: log ⇣ P(Yj) P(Y >j) ⌘ = ✓j µ.
57	14	We now present the following theorem which shows that these node-conditional distributions do not lead to a consistent joint distribution.
67	19	As in the previous section, given this univariate ordinal distribution, we ask if we could employ the strategy of Yang et al. (2012), of using these to specify node-conditional distributions, and deriving a consistent joint distribution?
69	14	The following theorem shows that these node conditional distributions do not lead to a consistent joint distribution.
79	13	,M} belongs to an exponential family with sufficient statistics {I[Y  j]}M 1j=0 : P[Y ] = exp ⇣ PM 1 j=0 ⌘j I[Y  j] A(⌘) ⌘ , where as before, ⌘j := ✓j µ, for j 2 {0, .
91	11	Consider the following discrete graphical model over the random vector Y: P(Y) / exp ⇣ X s2V,j2[M 1] ✓s;j I[Ys = j] + X (s,t)2E X j,k2[M 1] ✓st;jk I[Ys = j] I[Yt = k] ⌘ .
92	16	(7) Unlike the consecutive ratio model, the above model doesn’t have a common edge parameter ✓st for different values of Ys, Yt.
98	17	A natural class of multivariate distributions can be obtained by taking a multivariate latent random vector, and quantizing this to obtain a multivariate ordinal random vector.
103	21	Each Yi is obtained through discretization of Zi as follows: Yi = k, iff Zi 2 [✓(i)k 1, ✓ (i) k ), where {✓ (i) k }Mk= 1 is the set of thresholds, ✓(i) 1 = 1, ✓ (i) M = 1.
109	17	Accordingly, approximate EM based approaches (Chib & Greenberg, 1998; Guo et al., 2015) have been proposed for learning the model parameters, but these are still relatively computationally demanding, and also do not come with the strong statistical guarantees of the actual regularized MLE solutions.
120	31	Lets suppose we want to estimate ⌃jk, for j 6= k. The joint distribution of (Yj , Yk) is multinomial with probabilities P(Yj , Yk;⇥,⌃jk) = P(✓(j)Yj 1  Zj  ✓ (j) Yj , ✓(k)Yk 1  Zk  ✓ (k) Yk ;⌃jk), where the joint distribution of random variables Zj , Zk is bivariate normal with mean [0, 0] and covariance  1 ⌃jk ⌃jk 1 .
121	27	If ⇥⇤ is known, then one could estimate the unknown parameter ⌃jk by maximizing the bivariate marginal log likelihood function, which has the following form `jk( ;⇥ ⇤,Yn) = MX a=0 MX b=0 nab n log P(Yj = a, Yk = b;⇥⇤, ) = MX a=0 MX b=0 nab n log ab;jk( ;⇥ ⇤ ), (10) where nab = Pn i=1 I(yi,j = a,yi,k = b) and ab;jk( ;⇥) = P(Yj = a, Yk = b;⇥, ).
146	16	In the first step we show that our estimate ˜⌃ from step 1 satisfies: supj,k |˜⌃jk ⌃⇤jk|  c3 q log p0 n , with high probability.
172	13	Experimental Settings: In all our experiments we fix the number of nodes in the graph to 50 and set number of categories for each ordinal variable to 5.
174	10	In our first experiment we generate ordinal data from a probit model.
189	76	Also note that ProbitDirect is⇡ 5 times faster than ProbitEMApprox (See Table 1 in Appendix).
