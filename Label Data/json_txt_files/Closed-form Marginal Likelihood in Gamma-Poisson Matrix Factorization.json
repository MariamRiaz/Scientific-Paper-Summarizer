Introduction", "text": "The Gamma-Poisson (GaP) model is a probabilistic matrix factorization model which was introduced in the field of text information retrieval (Canny, 2004; Buntine & Jakulin, 2006). In this field, a corpus of text documents is typically represented by an integer-valued matrix V of size F \u00d7 N , where each column vn represents a document as a so-called \u201cbag of words\u201d. Given a vocabulary of F words (or in practice semantic stems), the matrix entry vfn is the number of occurrences of word f in the document n. GaP is a generative model described by a dictionary of \u201ctopics\u201d or \u201cpatterns\u201d W (a non-negative matrix of size F \u00d7K) and a nonnegative \u201cactivation\u201d or \u201cscore\u201d matrix H (of size K\u00d7N ), as follows:\nH \u223c \u220f k,n Gamma(hkn|\u03b1k, \u03b2k), (1)\nV|H \u223c \u220f f,n Poisson (vfn|[WH]fn) , (2)\n1IRIT, Universite\u0301 de Toulouse, CNRS, France.

The dictionary W is treated as a free deterministic variable.\nThough this generative model takes its origins in text information retrieval, it has found applications (with variants) in other areas such as image reconstruction (Cemgil, 2009), collaborative filtering (Ma et al., 2011; Gopalan et al., 2015) or audio signal processing (Virtanen et al., 2008).\nDenoting \u03b1 = [\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1K ]T , \u03b2 = [\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2K ]T , and treating the shape parameters \u03b1k as fixed hyperparameters, maximum joint likelihood estimation (MJLE) in GaP amounts to the minimization of\nCJL(W,H,\u03b2) def = \u2212 log p(V,H|W,\u03b2) (3) = DKL(V|WH) +R\u03b1(H,\u03b2) + cst (4)\nwhere DKL(\u00b7|\u00b7) is the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence defined by\nDKL(V|V\u0302) = \u2211 f,n ( vfn log ( vfn v\u0302fn ) \u2212 vfn + v\u0302fn ) (5)\nand\nR\u03b1(H,\u03b2) =\u2211 k,n [(1\u2212 \u03b1k) log(hkn) + \u03b2khkn]\u2212N \u2211 k \u03b1k log \u03b2k.\n(6)\nEquation (4) shows that MJLE is tantamount to penalized KL non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Lee & Seung, 2000) and may be addressed using alternating majorization-minimization (Canny, 2004; Fe\u0301votte & Idier, 2011; Dikmen & Fe\u0301votte, 2012).\nAs explained in Dikmen & Fe\u0301votte (2012), MJLE can be criticized from a statistical point of view. Indeed, the number of estimated parameters grows with the number of samples N (this is because H has as many columns as V). To overcome this issue, they have instead proposed to consider maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE), in which H is treated as a latent variable over which the\njoint likelihood is integrated. In other words, MMLE relies on the minimization of\nCML(W,\u03b2) def = \u2212 log p(V|W,\u03b2) (7) = \u2212 log \u222b\nH p(V|H,W,\u03b2)p(H|\u03b2)dH. (8)\nWe emphasize that MMLE treats the dictionary W as a free deterministic variable. This is in contrast with fully Bayesian approaches where W is given a prior, and where estimation revolves around the posterior p(W,H|V). For instance, Buntine & Jakulin (2006) place a Dirichlet prior on the columns of W, while Cemgil (2009) considers independent Gamma priors. Zhou et al. (2012), Zhou & Carin (2015) set a Dirichlet prior on the columns of W and a Gamma-based non-parametric Bayesian prior on H, which allows for possible rank estimation.\nDikmen & Fe\u0301votte (2012) assumed that a closed-form expression of CML was not available. Besides, they proposed variational and Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithms based on a complete set formed by H and a set of other latent components C that will later be defined. In their experiments, they found MMLE to be robust to over-specified values of K, while MJLE clearly overfit. This intriguing (and advantageous) behavior was left unexplained. In this paper, we provide the following contributions:\n\u2022 We provide a computable closed-form expression of CML. The expression is tedious to compute for large F and K, as it involves combinatorial operations, but is workable for reasonably dimensioned problems.\n\u2022 We show that the proposed closed-form expression reveals a penalization term on the columns of W that explains the \u201cself-regularization\u201d effect observed in Dikmen & Fe\u0301votte (2012).\n\u2022 We show that the marginalization of H allows to derive a new MCEM algorithm with favorable properties.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces preliminary material (composite form of GaP, useful probability distributions). In Section 3, we propose two new parameterizations of the GaP model in which H has been marginalized. This yields a closed-form expression of CML which is discussed in Section 4. Finally, a new MCEM algorithm is introduced in Section 5 and is compared to the MCEM algorithms proposed in Dikmen & Fe\u0301votte (2012) on synthetic and real data."}, {"heading": "2.

(31) Equation (31) is a computable closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood. It is free of H and in particular of the integral that appears in Equation (8). However the expression (31) is still semi-explicit because it involves a sum over the set of all admissible components C. C is countable set with cardinality #C = \u220f f,n ( vfn+K\u22121 K\u22121 ) . It is straightforward to construct but challenging to compute in large dimension, and for large values of vfn.\nThe sum over all the matrices in the set C expresses the convolution of the (discrete) probability distributions of the K components. Unfortunately, the distribution of the sum of independent negative multinomial variables of different event probabilities is not available in closed form.\nAs already known from Dikmen & Fe\u0301votte (2012), the value of the marginal likelihood is unchanged when the scales of the columns of W and the rates \u03b2 are changed accordingly. Let \u039b be a non-negative diagonal matrix of size K, it can easily be derived from Equation (31) that\np(V|W\u039b,\u03b2\u039b) = p(V|W,\u03b2). (32)\nWe therefore have a scaling invariance between W and \u03b2, and as such, we may fix \u03b2 to arbitrary values and leave W free. Thus, we will treat \u03b2 as a constant in the following and drop it from the arguments of CML."}, {"heading": "4.2. Self-regularization", "text": "Dikmen & Fe\u0301votte (2012) empirically studied the properties of MMLE. In particular, they observed the self-ability of the estimator to regularize the number of columns of W. For example, one experiment consisted in generating synthetic data according to the GaP model, with a ground-truth number of componentsK?. MMLE was run withK > K? and they noticed that the estimated W contained K \u2212K? empty columns. As such, the estimator was able to recover the ground-truth dimensionality. In contrast, MJLE used all K dimensions and overfit the data. They were unable to give a theoretical justification of the observed phenomenon, but provided a first insight thanks to a Laplace approximation of p(V|W). The closed-form expression (31) offers\na deeper understanding of this phenomenon, as explained next.\nUsing Equations (31) and (30) and treating \u03b2 as a constant, the negative log-likelihood can be expressed as\n1\nN CML(W) =\n\u2212 1 N log \u2211 C\u2208C \u2126\u03b1(C) \u220f f,k p \u2211 n cfkn fk  (33) + \u2211 k \u03b1k log(||wk||1 + \u03b2k) + cst, (34)\nwhere cst = \u2212 \u2211 k \u03b1k log \u03b2k.\nThe negative log-likelihood reveals two terms. The first term, Equation (33), captures the interaction between data V (through C) and the parameter W (through the event probabilities pfk = wfk/(\u2016wk\u20161 +\u03b2k)). The second term, Equation (34), only depends on the parameter W and can be interpreted as a group-regularization term. The nonconvex and sharply peaked function f(x) = \u2211 k log(xk + b) is known to be sparsity-inducing (Cande\u0300s et al., 2008). As such, the term (34) will promote sparsity of the norms of the columns of W. When a norm ||wk||1 is set to zero for some k, the whole column wk is set to zero because of the non-negativity constraint. This gives a formal explanation of the ability of MMLE to automatically prune columns of W, without any explicit sparsity-inducing prior at the modeling stage (recall that W is a deterministic parameter without a prior)."}, {"heading": "5. MCEM algorithms form MMLE", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1. Expectation-Maximization", "text": "We now turn to the problem of optimizing Equation (8) by leveraging on the results of Section 4. Despite obtaining a closed-form expression, the direct optimization of the marginal likelihood remains difficult. However, the structure of GaP makes Expectation-Maximization (EM) a natural option (Dempster et al., 1977). Indeed, GaP involves observed variables V and latent variables C and H. As such, we can derive several EM algorithms based on various choices of the complete set. More precisely, we consider three possible choices that each define a different algorithm, as follows.\nEM-CH. The complete set is {C,H} and EM consists in the iterative minimization w.r.t W of the functional defined by QCH(W|W\u0303) = \u2212 \u222b\nC,H log p(C,H|W)p(C,H|V, W\u0303)dCdH,\n(35)\nwhere W\u0303 is the current estimate.

This corresponds to the general formulation of EM in which the relation between the complete set and the data is a many-to-one mapping and slightly differs from the more usual one where the complete set is formed by the union of data and a hidden set (Dempster et al., 1977; Fe\u0301votte et al., 2011).\nEM-H.

Equation (49) implies that the rows of the estimate WMCEM-C at every iteration sum to a constant. This behavior is illustrated on Figure 1."}, {"heading": "6. Experimental results", "text": "We now compare the three MCEM algorithms proposed for MMLE in the GaP model, first using synthetic toy datasets, then real-world data. Python implementations of the three algorithms are available from the first author website."}, {"heading": "6.1. Experiments with synthetic data", "text": "We generate a dataset of N = 100 samples according to the GaP model, with the following parameters:\nW?1 =  0.638 0.075 0.009 0.568 0.044 0.126 0.309 0.231  , \u03b1? = \u03b2? = 1. (50) The columns of W?1 have been generated from a Dirichlet distribution (with parameters 1). The generated dataset (of size 4\u00d7 100) is denoted by V1.\nWe proceed to estimate the dictionary W using hyperparemeters K = K? + 1 = 3, \u03b1k = \u03b2k = 1 with MCEM-C, MCEM-H and MCEM-CH. The algorithms are run for 500 iterations. 300 Gibbs samples are generated at each iteration, with the first 150 samples being discarded for burn-in (this proves to be enough in practice), leading to J = 150. The Gibbs sampler at EM iteration i + 1 is initialized with the last sample obtained at EM iteration i (warm restart). The algorithms are initialized from the same deterministic starting point given by\nwfk = 1\nK \u03b2k \u03b1k vf , (51)\nas suggested by Equation (49).\nFigure 2 displays the negative log-likelihood CML(W), computed thanks to the derivations of Section 4, and Figure 3-(a) displays the norm of the three columns of the iterates, both w.r.t. CPU time in seconds. The three algorithms have almost identical computation times, most of the computational burden residing in the Gibbs sampling procedure that is common to the three algorithms. Moreover, the three algorithms converge to the same point, with MCEM-C converging marginally faster than the other two in this case.\nThen we proceed to generate a second dataset V2 according to the GaP model, with now W?2 = 100 \u00d7W?1. The\nexpectation of V2 is thus a hundred times the expectation of V1. We apply the exact same experimental protocol to V2 as we did for V1, except that the algorithms are now run for a larger number of 2000 iterations. In this case, because of the combinatorial nature of #C, it is impossible to compute the likelihood in reasonable time. The norms of the columns of the iterates are displayed on Figure 3-(b). As we can see, MCEM-C clearly outperforms the other two algorithms in this scenario. This behavior has been consistently found when estimating dictionaries from datasets with sufficiently large values. This drastic difference in convergence is unexplained at this stage. However, we conjecture that this is linked to the over-dispersion of the data (i.e. when the variance is greater than the mean), which increases with the scale of W. This will be studied in future work."}, {"heading": "6.2. Experiments with the NIPS dataset", "text": "Finally, we consider the NIPS dataset which contains word counts from a collection of articles published at the NIPS conference.1 The number of articles is N = 1, 500 and the number of unique terms (appearing at least 10 times after tokenization and removing stop-words) is F = 12, 419. The matrix V is quite sparse as 96% of its coefficients are zeros. This saves a large amount of computational effort, because we only need to sample cfn for pairs (f, n) such that vfn is non-zero. Moreover, the count values range from 0 to 132.\nWe applied MCEM-C and MCEM-CH with K = 10 and \u03b1k = \u03b2k = 1. The algorithms are run for 1, 000 iterations. 250 Gibbs samples are generated in each iteration with the first half being discarded for burn-in (i.e. J = 125). The Gibbs sampler at iteration i + 1 is again initialized with warm restart. The algorithms are initialized using Equation (51). MCEM-H results in similar performance than MCEM-CH and is not reported here.\nFigure 4 shows that the column norms of the iterates w.r.t. CPU time in seconds. The difference in convergence speed between the two algorithms is again striking. MCEM-C efficiently explores the parameter space in the first iterations and converges dramatically faster than MCEM-CH. The algorithms here converge to different solutions, which confirms the non-convexity of CML(W). Other runs confirmed that MCEM-C is consistently faster, and also that the two algorithms do not always converge to the same solution.\nMCEM-C still takes a few hours to converge. We implemented stochastic variants of the EM algorithm such as SAEM (Kuhn & Lavielle, 2004), however this did not result in significant improvements in our case. Finally, note that large-scale implementations are possible using for example on-line EM (Cappe\u0301 & Moulines, 2009)."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have shown how the Gamma-Poisson model can be rewritten free of the latent variables H. This new parametrization enabled us to come up with a closedform expression of the marginal likelihood, which revealed a penalization term explaining the \u201cself-regularization\u201d effect described in Dikmen & Fe\u0301votte (2012). We then proceeded to compare three MCEM algorithms for the task of maximizing the likelihood, and the algorithm taking advantage of the marginalization H has been empirically proven to have better convergence properties.\nIn this work, we treated \u03b1 as a fixed hyperparameter. Fu-\n1https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ bag+of+words\nture work will focus on lifting this hypothesis, and on designing algorithms to estimate both W and \u03b1.
