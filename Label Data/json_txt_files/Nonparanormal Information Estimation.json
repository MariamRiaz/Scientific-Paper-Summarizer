Introduction", "text": "This paper is concerned with the problem of estimating entropy or mutual information of an unknown probability density p over RD, given n i.i.d. samples from p. Entropy and mutual information are fundamental information theoretic quantities, and consistent estimators for these quantities have a host of applications within machine learning, statistics, and signal processing. For example, entropy estimators have been used for goodness-of-fit testing (Goria et al., 2005), parameter estimation in semi-parametric models (Wolsztynski et al., 2005), texture classification and image registration (Hero et al., 2001; 2002), change point de-\n1Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA.

Mutual information is a popular nonparametric measure of dependence, whose estimators have been used in feature selection (Peng et al., 2005; Shishkin et al., 2016), clustering (Aghagolzadeh et al., 2007), learning graphical models (Chow & Liu, 1968), fMRI data processing (Chai et al., 2009), prediction of protein structures (Adami, 2004), boosting and facial expression recognition (Shan et al., 2005), and fitting deep nonlinear models (Hunter & Hodas, 2016). Estimators for both entropy and mutual information have been used in independent component and subspace analysis (Learned-Miller & Fisher, 2003; Szabo\u0301 et al., 2007a).\nMotivated by these and other applications, several very recent lines of work (discussed in Section 3) have studied information estimation,1 focusing largely on two settings:\n1. Gaussian Setting: If p is known to be Gaussian, there exist information estimators with mean squared error (MSE) at most \u22122 log ( 1\u2212 Dn ) and an (almost matching) minimax lower bound of 2D/n (Cai et al., 2015). 2. Nonparametric Setting: If p is assumed to lie in a nonparametric smoothness class, such an s-order2 Ho\u0308lder or Sobolev class, then the minimax MSE is of asymptotic order max { n\u22121, n\u2212 8s 4s+D } (Birge\u0301 & Massart, 1995).\nIn the Gaussian setting, consistent estimation is tractable even in the high-dimensional case whereD increases fairly quickly with n, as long as D/n \u2192 0. However, optimal estimators for the Gaussian setting rely heavily on the assumption of joint Gaussianity, and their performance can degrade quickly when the data deviate from Gaussian. Especially in high dimensions, it is unlikely that data are jointly Gaussian, making these estimators brittle in practice. In the nonparametric setting, the theoretical convergence rate decays exponentially with D, and, it has been found empirically that information estimators for this setting fail to converge at realistic sample sizes in all but very low dimensions. Also, most nonparametric estimators are sensitive to tuning of bandwidth parameters, which is chal-\n1We will collectively call the closely related problems of entropy and mutual information estimation information estimation.\n2Here, s encodes the degree of smoothness, roughly corresponding to the number of continuous derivatives of p.\nlenging for information estimation, since no empirical error estimate is available for cross-validation.\nGiven these factors, though the Gaussian and nonparametric cases are fairly well understood in theory, there remains a lack of practical information estimators for the common case where data are neither exactly Gaussian nor very low dimensional. The main goal of this paper is to fill the gap between these two extreme settings by studying information estimation in a semiparametric compromise between the two, known as the \u201cnonparanormal\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cGaussian copula\u201d) model (see Definition 2). The nonparanormal model, analogous to the additive model popular in regression (Friedman & Stuetzle, 1981), limits complexity of interactions among variables but makes minimal assumptions on the marginal distribution of each variable. The result scales better with dimension than nonparametric models, while being more robust than Gaussian models.\nProofs of our main results, as well as additional experiments and details are given in the extended version of this paper 3.

The definition we consider is simply the difference between the sum of marginal entropies and the joint entropy:\nDefinition 1. (Multivariate mutual information) Let X1, . . . , XD be R-valued random variables with a joint probability density p : RD \u2192 [0,\u221e) and marginal densities p1, ..., pD : R\u2192 [0,\u221e). The multivariate mutual information I(X) of X = (X1, . . . , XD) is defined by\nI(X) := E X\u223cp\n[ log ( p(X)\u220fD\nj=1 pj(Xj)\n)]\n= D\u2211 j=1 H(Xj)\u2212H(X), (1)\nwhere H(X) = \u2212EX\u223cp[log p(X)] denotes entropy of X .\nThis notion of multivariate mutual information, originally due to Watanabe (1960) (who called it \u201ctotal correlation\u201d) measures total dependency, or redundancy, within a set of D random variables. It has also been called the \u201cmultivariate constraint\u201d (Garner, 1962) and \u201cmultiinformation\u201d (Studeny\u0300 & Vejnarova\u0301, 1998). Many related information theoretic quantities can be expressed in\n3accessible at http://www.contrib.andrew. cmu.edu/\u02dcsss1/publications/papers/ nonparanormal-information-estimation.pdf\n4https://github.com/sss1/ nonparanormal-information\nterms of I(X), and can thus be estimated using estimators of I(X). Examples include pairwise mutual information I(X,Y ) = I((X,Y ))\u2212I(X)\u2212I(Y ), which measures dependence between (potentially multivariate) random variables X and Y , conditional mutual information\nI(X|Z) = I((X,Z))\u2212 D\u2211 j=1 I((Xj , Z)),\nwhich is useful for characterizing how much dependence within X can be explained by a latent variable Z (Studeny\u0300 & Vejnarova\u0301, 1998), and transfer entropy (a.k.a. \u201cdirected information\u201d) TX \u2192 Y , which measures predictive power of one time series X on the future of another time series Y . I(X) is also related to entropy via Eq. (1), but, unlike the above quantities, this relationship depends on the marginal distributions of X , and hence involves some additional considerations, as discussed in Section 8.\nWe now define the class of nonparanormal distributions, from which we assume our data are drawn.\nDefinition 2. (Nonparanormal distribution, a.k.a. Gaussian copula model) A random vector X = (X1, . . . , XD)\nT is said to have a nonparanormal distribution (denoted X \u223c NPN (\u03a3; f)) if there exist functions {fj}Dj=1 such that each fj : R \u2192 R is a diffeomorphism 5 and f(X) \u223c N (0,\u03a3), for some (strictly) positive definite \u03a3 \u2208 RD\u00d7D with 1\u2019s on the diagonal (i.e., each \u03c3j = \u03a3j,j = 1). 6 \u03a3 is called the latent covariance of X and f is called the marginal transformation of X .\nThe nonparanormal family relaxes many constraints of the Gaussian family. Nonparanormal distributions can be multi-modal, skewed, or heavy-tailed, can encode noisy nonlinear dependencies, and need not be supported on RD. Minimal assumptions are made on the marginal distributions; any desired continuously differentiable marginal cumulative distribution function (CDF) Fi of variableXi corresponds to marginal transformation fi(x) = \u03a6\u22121(Fi(x)) (where \u03a6 is the standard normal CDF). As examples, for a Gaussian variable Z, the 2-dimensional case, X1 \u223c N (0, 1), and X2 = T (X1 + Z) is nonparanormal when T (x) = x3, T = tanh, T = \u03a6, or any other diffeomorphism. On the other hand, the limits of the Gaussian copula appear, for example, when T (x) = x2, which is not bijective; then, if E[Z] = 0, the Gaussian copula approximation of (X1, X2) models X1 and X2 as independent.\n5A diffeomorphism is a continuously differentiable bijection g : R\u2192 R \u2286 R such that g\u22121 is continuously differentiable.\n6Setting E [f(X)] = 0 and each \u03c3j = 1 ensures model identifiability, but does not reduce the model space, since these parameters can be absorbed into the marginal transformation f .\nWe are now ready to formally state our problem:\nFormal Problem Statement: Given n i.i.d. samples X1, ..., Xn \u223c NPN (\u03a3; f), where \u03a3 and f are both unknown, we would like to estimate I(X).\nOther notation: D denotes the dimension of the data (i.e., \u03a3 \u2208 RD\u00d7D and f : RD \u2192 RD). For a positive integer k, [k] = {1, ..., k} denotes the set of positive integers less than k (inclusive). For consistency, where possible, we use i \u2208 [n] to index samples and j \u2208 [D] to index dimensions (so that, e.g., Xi,j denotes the jth dimension of the ith sample). Given a data matrix X \u2208 Rn\u00d7D, our estimators depend on the empirical rank matrix\nR \u2208 [n]n\u00d7D with Ri,j := n\u2211 k=1 1{Xi,j\u2265Xk,j}.

Related Work and Our Contributions", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. The Nonparanormal", "text": "Nonparanormal models have been used for modeling dependencies among high-dimensional data in a number of fields, such as graphical modeling of gene expression data (Liu et al., 2012), of neural data (Berkes et al., 2009), and of financial time series (Malevergne & Sornette, 2003; Wilson & Ghahramani, 2010; Herna\u0301ndez-Lobato et al., 2013), extreme value analysis in hydrology (Renard & Lang, 2007; Aghakouchak, 2014), and informative data compression (Rey & Roth, 2012).\nWith one recent exception (Ince et al., 2017), previous information estimators for the nonparanormal case (Calsaverini & Vicente, 2009; Ma & Sun, 2011; Elidan, 2013), rely on fully nonparametric information estimators as subroutines, and hence suffer strongly from the curse of dimensionality. Very recently, Ince et al. (2017) proposed what we believe is the first mutual information estimator tailored specifically to the nonparanormal case; their estimator is equivalent to one of the estimators (IG, described in Section 4.1) we study. However, they focused on its applications to neuroimaging data analysis, and did not study its performance theoretically or empirically."}, {"heading": "3.2. Information Estimation", "text": "Our motivation for studying the nonparanormal family comes from trying to bridge two recent approaches to information estimation. The first has studied fully nonparametric entropy estimation, assuming only that data are drawn from a smooth probability density p, where smoothness is typically quantified by a Ho\u0308lder or Sobolev exponent s \u2208 (0,\u221e), roughly corresponding to the continuous differentiability of s. In this setting, the minimax optimal MSE rate has been shown by Birge\u0301 & Massart (1995) to be O ( max { n\u22121, n\u2212 8s 4s+D }) . This rate slows exponen-\ntially with the dimension D, and, while many estimators have been proposed (Pa\u0301l et al., 2010; Sricharan et al., 2011; 2013; Singh & Po\u0301czos, 2014a;b; Krishnamurthy et al., 2014; Moon & Hero, 2014b;a; Singh & Po\u0301czos, 2016a; Moon et al., 2017) for this setting, their practical use is limited to a few dimensions7.\nThe second area is in the setting where data are assumed to be drawn from a truly Gaussian distribution. Here the highdimensional case is far more optimistic. While this case had been studied previously (Ahmed & Gokhale, 1989; Misra et al., 2005; Srivastava & Gupta, 2008), Cai et al. (2015) recently provided a precise finite-sample analysis based on deriving the exact probability law of the logdeterminant log |\u03a3\u0302| of the scatter matrix \u03a3\u0302. From this, they derived a deterministic bias correction, giving an estimator for which they prove an MSE upper bound of \u22122 log ( 1\u2212 Dn ) and a high-dimensional central limit theorem for the case D \u2192\u221e as n\u2192\u221e (but D < n).\nCai et al. (2015) also prove a minimax lower bound of 2D/n on MSE, with several interesting consequences. First, consistent information estimation is possible only if D/n \u2192 0. Second, since, for small x, \u2212 log(1 \u2212 x) \u2248 x, this lower bound essentially matches the above upper bound when D/n is small. Third, they show this lower bound holds even when restricted to diagonal covariance matrices. Since the upper bound for the general case and the lower bound for the diagonal case essentially match, it follows that Gaussian information estimation is not made easier by structural assumptions such as \u03a3 being bandable, sparse, or Toeplitz, as is common in, for example, stationary Gaussian process models (Cai & Yuan, 2012).\nThis 2D/n lower bound extends to our more general nonparanormal setting. However, we provide a minimax lower bound suggesting that the nonparanormal setting is strictly harder, in that optimal rates depend on \u03a3. Our results imply\n7\u201cFew\u201d depends on s and n, but Kandasamy et al. (2015) suggest nonparametric estimators should only be used withD at most 4-6. Rey & Roth (2012) tried using several nonparametric information estimators on the Communities and Crime UCI data set (n = 2195, D = 10), but found all too unstable to be useful.\nnonparanormal information estimation does become easier if \u03a3 is assumed to be bandable or Toeplitz.\nA closely related point is that known convergence rates for the fully nonparametric case require the density p to be bounded away from 0 or have particular tail behavior, due to singularity of the logarithm near 0 and resulting sensitivity of Shannon information-theoretic functionals to regions of low but non-zero probability. In contrast, Cai et al. (2015) need no lower-bound-type assumptions in the Gaussian case. In the nonparanormal case, we show some such condition is needed to prove a uniform rate, but a weaker condition, a positive lower bound on \u03bbD(\u03a3), suffices.\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\n1. We propose three estimators, I\u0302G, I\u0302\u03c1, and I\u0302\u03c4 ,8 for the mutual information of a nonparanormal distribution. 2. We prove upper bounds, of order O(D2/(\u03bb2D(\u03a3)n)) on the mean squared error of I\u0302\u03c1, providing the first upper bounds for a nonparanormal information estimator. This bound suggests nonparanormal estimators scale far better with D than nonparametric estimators. 3. We prove a minimax lower bound suggesting that, unlike the Gaussian case, difficulty of nonparanormal information estimation depends on the true \u03a3. 4. We give simulations comparing our proposed estimators to Gaussian and nonparametric estimators. Besides confirming and augmenting our theoretical predictions, these help characterize the settings in which each nonparanormal estimator works best. 5. We present entropy estimators based on I\u0302G, I\u0302\u03c1, and I\u0302\u03c4 . Though nonparanormal entropy estimation requires somewhat different assumptions from mutual information estimation, we show that entropy can also be estimated at the rate O(D2/(\u03bb2D(\u03a3)n))."}, {"heading": "4. Nonparanormal Information Estimators", "text": "In this section, we present three different estimators, IG, I\u03c1, and I\u03c4 , for the mutual information of a nonparanormal distribution. We begin with a lemma providing common motivation for all three estimators.\nSince mutual information is invariant to diffeomorphisms of individual variables, it is easy to see that the mutual information of a nonparanormal random variable is the same as that of the latent Gaussian random variable.

First, the data are transformed to have approximately standard normal marginal distributions, a process Szabo\u0301 et al. (2007b) referred to as \u201cGaussianization\u201d. By the nonparanormal assumption, the Gaussianized data are approximately jointly Gaussian. Then, the latent covariance matrix is estimated by the empirical covariance of the Gaussianized data.\nMore specifically, letting \u03a6\u22121 denote the quantile function of the standard normal distribution and recalling the rank matrix R defined in (2), the Gaussianized data\nX\u0303i,j := \u03a6 \u22121 ( Ri,j n+ 1 ) (for i \u2208 [n], j \u2208 [D])\nare obtained by transforming the empirical CDF of the each dimension to approximate \u03a6.

(Kruskal, 1958): Suppose (X,Y ) has a Gaussian joint distribution with covariance \u03a3. Then,\nCorr(X,Y ) = 2 sin (\u03c0\n6 \u03c1(X,Y )\n) = sin (\u03c0 2 \u03c4(X,Y ) ) .\n\u03c1 and \u03c4 are often preferred over Pearson correlation for their relative robustness to outliers and applicability to nonnumerical ordinal data. While these are strengths here as well, the main reason for their relevance is that they are invariant to marginal transformations (i.e., for diffeomorphisms f, g : R \u2192 R, \u03c1(f(X), g(Y )) = \u00b1\u03c1(X,Y ) and \u03c4(f(X), g(Y )) = \u00b1\u03c4(X,Y )). As a consequence, the identity provided in Theorem 4 extends unchanged to the case (X,Y ) \u223c NPN (\u03a3; f). This suggests an estimate for \u03a3 based on estimating \u03c1 or \u03c4 and plugging this elementwise into the transform x 7\u2192 2 sin ( \u03c0 6x ) or x 7\u2192 sin ( \u03c0 2x ) , respectively. Specifically, \u03a3\u03c1 is defined by\n\u03a3\u0302\u03c1 := 2 sin (\u03c0 6 \u03c1\u0302 ) , where \u03c1\u0302 = C\u0302orr(R)\nis the empirical correlation of the rank matrix R, and sine is applied element-wise.

As a result, directly plugging into the mutual information functional (3) may give \u221e or be undefined. To correct for this, we propose a regularization step, in which we project each estimated latent covariance matrix onto the (closed) cone S(z) of symmetric matrices with minimum eigenvalue z > 0. Specifically, for any z > 0, let\nS(z) := { A \u2208 RD\u00d7D : A = AT , \u03bbD(A) \u2265 z } .\nFor any symmetric matrix A \u2208 RD\u00d7D with eigendecomposition \u03a3\u0302 = Q\u039bQ\u22121 (i.e., QQT = QTQ = ID and \u039b is diagonal), the projection Az of A onto S(z) is defined as Az := Q\u039bzQ\u22121, where \u039bz is the diagonal matrix with jth nonzero entry (\u039bz)j,j = max{z,\u039bj,j}.

However, for the purpose of understanding convergence rates, we are more interested in the variance bound that follows as an easy corollary:\nCorollary 7. Suppose X1, ..., Xn i.i.d.\u223c NPN (\u03a3; f). Then, for any z > 0, the variance of I\u0302\u03c1,z is at most\nV [ I\u0302\u03c1,z ] \u2264 36\u03c0 2D2\nz2n .\nGiven these bias and variance bounds, a bound on the MSE of I\u0302\u03c1,z follows via the usual bias-variance decomposition:\nTheorem 8. Suppose X \u223c NPN (\u03a3; f). Then, there exists a constant C such that\nE [( I\u0302\u03c1,z \u2212 I )2] \u2264 C ( D2\nz2n + log2 |\u03a3z| |\u03a3|\n) . (4)\nA natural question is now how to optimally select the regularization parameter z. While the bound (4) is clearly convex in z, it depends crucially on the unknown spectrum of \u03a3, and, in particular, on the smallest eigenvalues of \u03a3. As a result, it is difficult to choose z optimally in general, but we can do so for certain common subclasses of covariance matrices. For example, if \u03a3 is Toeplitz or bandable (i.e., for some c \u2208 (0, 1), all |\u03a3i,j | \u2264 c|i\u2212j|), then the smallest eigenvalue of \u03a3 can be bounded below (Cai & Yuan, 2012). When \u03a3 is bandable, as we show in the Appendix, this bound can be independent of D. In these cases, the following somewhat simpler MSE bound can be used: Corollary 9. Suppose X \u223c NPN (\u03a3; f), and suppose z \u2264 \u03bbD(\u03a3). Then, there exists a constant C > 0 such that\nE [( I\u0302\u03c1,z \u2212 I )2] \u2264 CD 2\nz2n ."}, {"heading": "6.

Unfortunately, the main result of this section is a negative one, showing that this property is unlikely to hold without additional assumptions: Proposition 10. Consider the 2-dimensional case\nX1, ..., Xn i.i.d\u223c N (0,\u03a3), with \u03a3 = [ 1 \u03c3 \u03c3 1 ] , (5)\nand let \u03c3\u2217 \u2208 (0, 1). Suppose an estimator I\u0302 = I\u0302(R) of I\u03c3 = \u2212 12 log(1 \u2212 \u03c3\n2) is a function of the empirical rank matrix R \u2208 Nn\u00d72 of X .

As written, this result lower bounds the error of rank-based estimators in the Gaussian case when \u03c3 \u2248 1. However, to the best of our knowledge, all methods for estimating \u03a3 in the nonparanormal case are functions of R, and prior work (Hoff, 2007) has shown that the rank matrix R is a generalized sufficient statistic for \u03a3 (and hence for I) in the nonparanormal model. Thus, it is reasonable to think of lower bounds for rank-based estimators in the Gaussian case as lower bounds for any estimator in the nonparanormal case.\nThe proof of this result is based on the simple observation that the rank matrix can take only finitely many values. Hence, as \u03c3 \u2192 1, R tends to be perfectly correlated, providing little information about \u03c3, whereas the dependence of the estimand I\u03c3 on \u03c3 increases sharply. This is intuition is formalized in the Appendix using Le Cam\u2019s lemma for lower bounds in two-point parameter estimation problems."}, {"heading": "7. Empirical Results", "text": "We compare 5 mutual information estimators:\n\u2022 I\u0302: Gaussian plug-in estimator with bias-correction (see Cai et al.

We did not regularize for IG. Although this implies P[IG = \u221e] > 0, this is extremely unlikely for even moderate values of n and never occurred during our experiments, which all use n \u2265 32. We thus omit denoting dependence on z. For IkNN, except as noted in Experiment 3, k = 2, based on recent analysis (Singh & Po\u0301czos, 2016b) suggesting that small values of k are best for estimation.\nSufficient details to reproduce experiments are given in the Appendix, and MATLAB source code is available at [Omitted for anonymity]. We report MSE based on 1000 i.i.d. trials of each condition. 95% confidence intervals were consistently smaller than plot markers and hence omitted to avoid cluttering plots. Except as specified otherwise, each experiment had the following basic structure: In each trial, a correlation matrix \u03a3 was drawn by normalizing a random covariance matrix from a Wishart distribution, and data X1, ..., Xn\ni.i.d.\u223c N (0,\u03a3) drawn. All 5 estimators were computed fromX1, ..., Xn and squared error from true mutual information (computed from \u03a3) was recorded. Unless specified otherwise, n = 100 and D = 25.\nSince our nonparanormal information estimators are func-\ntions of ranks of the data, neither the true mutual information nor our non-paranormal estimators depend on the marginal transformations. Thus, except in Experiment 2, where we show the effects of transforming marginals, and Experiment 3, where we add outliers to the data, we perform all experiments on truly Gaussian data, with the understanding that this setting favors the Gaussian estimator.\nAll experimental results are displayed in Figure 1.\nExperiment 1 (Dependence on n): We first show nonparanormal estimators have \u201cparametric\u201d O(n\u22121) dependence on n, unlike I\u0302kNN, which converges far more slowly. For large n, MSEs of I\u0302G, I\u0302\u03c1, and I\u0302\u03c4 are close to that of I\u0302 .\nExperiment 2 (Non-Gaussian Marginals): Next, we show nonparanormal estimators are robust to nonGaussianity of the marginals, unlike I\u0302 . We applied a nonlinear transformation f to a fraction \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] of dimensions of Gaussian data. That is, we drew Z1, ..., Zn\ni.i.d.\u223c N (0,\u03a3) and then used data X1, ..., Xn, where\nXi,j = { T (Zi,j) if j < \u03b1D Zi,j if j \u2265 \u03b1D , \u2200i \u2208 [n], j \u2208 [D],\nfor a diffeomorphism T . Here, we use T (z) = ez . The Appendix shows similar results for several other T . I\u0302 performs poorly even when \u03b1 is quite small. Poor performance of I\u0302kNN may be due to discontinuity of the density at x = 0.\nExperiment 3 (Outliers): We now show that nonparanormal estimators are far more robust to the presence of outliers than I\u0302 or I\u0302kNN. To do this, we added outliers to the data according to the method of Liu et al. (2012). After drawing Gaussian data, we independently select b\u03b2nc samples in each dimension, and replace each i.i.d. uniformly at random from {\u22125,+5}. Performance of I\u0302 degrades rapidly even for small \u03b2. I\u0302kNN can fail for atomic distributions, I\u0302kNN = \u221e whenever at least k samples are identical. This mitigate this, we increased k to 20 and ignored trials where I\u0302kNN = \u221e, but I\u0302kNN ceased to give any finite estimates when \u03b2 was sufficiently large.\nFor small values of \u03b2, nonparanormal estimators surprisingly improve. We hypothesize this is due to convexity of the mutual information functional Eq. (3) in \u03a3. By Jensen\u2019s inequality, estimators which plug-in an approximately unbiased estimate \u03a3\u0302 of \u03a3 are biased towards overestimating I . Adding random (uncorrelated) noise reduces estimated dependence, moving the estimate closer to the true value. If this nonlinearity is indeed a major source of bias, it may be possible to derive a von Mises-type bias correction (see Kandasamy et al. (2015)) accounting for higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of the log-determinant.\nExperiment 4 (Dependence on \u03a3): Here, we verify our results in Section 6 showing that MSE of rank-based estima-\ntors approaches\u221e as |\u03a3| \u2192 0, while MSE of I\u0302 is independent of \u03a3. Here, we set D = 2 and \u03a3 as in Eq. (5), varying \u03c3 \u2208 [0, 1]. Indeed, the MSE of I\u0302 does not change, while the MSEs of I\u0302G, I\u0302\u03c1, and I\u0302\u03c4 all increase as \u03c3 \u2192 1. This increase seems mild in practice, with performance worse than of I\u0302 only when \u03c3 > 0.99. I\u0302\u03c4 appears to perform far better than I\u0302G and I\u0302\u03c1 in this regime. Performance of IkNN degrades far more quickly as \u03c3 \u2192 1. This phenomenon is explored by Gao et al. (2015), who lower bound error of IkNN in the presence of strong dependencies, and proposed a correction to improve performance in this case.\nIt is also interesting that errors of I\u0302\u03c1 and I\u0302\u03c4 drop as \u03c3 \u2192 0. This is likely because, for small \u03c3, the main source of error is the variance of \u03c1\u0302 and \u03c4\u0302 (as \u2212 log(1 \u2212 \u03c32) \u2248 \u03c32 when \u03c3 \u2248 0). When n \u2192 \u221e and D is fixed, both 2 sin(\u03c0\u03c1\u0302/6) and sin(\u03c0\u03c4\u0302/2) are asymptotically normal estimates of \u03c3, with asymptotic variances proportional to (1\u2212\u03c32)2 (Klaassen & Wellner, 1997). By the delta method, since dId\u03c3 = \u03c3 1\u2212\u03c32 , I\u0302\u03c1 and I\u0302\u03c4 are asymptotically normal estimates of I , with asymptotic variances proportional to \u03c32 and hence vanishing as \u03c3 \u2192 0."}, {"heading": "8. Estimating Entropy", "text": "Thus far, we have discussed estimation of mutual information I(X). Mutual information is convenient because it is invariant under marginal transformation, and hence I(X) = I(f(X)) depends only on \u03a3. While the entropy H(X) does depend on the marginal transform f , fortunately, by Eq. (1), H(X) differs from I(X) only by a sum of univariate entropies. Univariate nonparametric estimation of entropy in has been studied extensively, and there exist several estimators (e.g., based on sample spacings (Beirlant et al., 1997), kernel density estimates (Moon et al., 2016) or k-nearest neighbor methods (Singh & Po\u0301czos, 2016b)) that can estimate H(Xj) at the rate n\u22121 in MSE under relatively mild conditions on the marginal density pj . While the precise assumptions vary with the choice of estimator, they are mainly (a) that pj be lower bounded on its support or have particular (e.g., exponential) tail behavior, and (b) that pj be smooth, typically quantified by a Ho\u0308lder or Sobolev condition. Details of these assumptions are in the Appendix.\nUnder these conditions, since there exist estimators H\u03021, ..., H\u0302D and a constant C > 0 such that\nE[(H\u0302j \u2212H(Xj))2] \u2264 C/n, \u2200j \u2208 [D].

Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "This paper suggests nonparanormal information estimation as a practical compromise between the intractable nonparametric case and the limited Gaussian case. We proposed three estimators for this problem and provided the first upper bounds for nonparanormal information estimation. We also gave lower bounds showing how dependence on \u03a3 differs from the Gaussian case and demonstrated empirically that nonparanormal estimators are more robust than Gaussian estimators, even in dimensions too high for nonparametric estimators.\nCollectively, these results suggest that, by scaling to moderate or high dimensionality without relying on Gaussianity, nonparanormal information estimators may be effective tools with a number of machine learning applications. While the best choice of information estimator inevitably depends on context, as an off-the-shelf guide for practitioners, the estimators we suggest, in order of preference, are:\n\u2022 fully nonparametric if D < 6, n > max{100, 10D}. \u2022 I\u0302\u03c1 if D2/n is small and data may have outliers. \u2022 I\u0302\u03c4 if D2/n is small and dependencies may be strong. \u2022 I\u0302G otherwise. \u2022 I\u0302 only given strong belief that data are nearly Gaussian.\nThere are many natural open questions in this line of work. First, in the nonparanormal model, we focused on estimating mutual information I(X), which does not depend on marginal transforms f , and entropy, which decomposes into I(X) and 1-dimensional entropies. In both cases, additional structure imposed by the nonparanormal model allows estimation in higher dimensions than fully nonparametric models. Can nonparanormal assumptions lead to\nhigher dimensional estimators for the many other useful nonlinear functionals of densities (e.g., Lp norms/distances and more general (e.g., Re\u0301nyi or Tsallis) entropies, mutual informations, and divergences) that do not decompose?\nSecond, there is a gap between our upper bound rate of \u2016\u03a3\u22121\u201622D2/n and the only known lower bound of 2D/n (from the Gaussian case), though we also showed that bounds for rank-based estimators depend on \u03a3. Is quadratic dependence on D optimal? How much do rates improve under structural assumptions on \u03a3? Upper bounds should be derived for other estimators, such as I\u0302G and I\u0302\u03c4 . The 2D/n lower bound proof of Cai et al. (2015) for the Gaussian case, based on the Cramer-Rao inequality (Van den Bos, 2007), is unlikely to tighten in the nonparanormal case, since Fisher information is invariant to diffeomorphisms of the data. Hence, a new approach is needed if the lower bound in the nonparanormal case is to be raised.\nFinally, our work applies to estimating the log-determinant log |\u03a3| of the latent correlation in a nonparanormal model. Besides information estimation, the work of Cai et al. (2015) on estimating log |\u03a3| in the Gaussian model was motivated by the role of log |\u03a3| in other multivariate statistical tools, such as quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and MANOVA (Anderson, 1984). Can our estimators lead to more robust nonparanormal versions of these tools?"}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This research is supported in part by DOE grant DESC0011114 and NSF grant IIS1563887 to B.P., and by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to S.S. under Grant No. DGE-1252522.

This problem has recently received attention in two settings: (1) where p is assumed to be Gaussian and (2) where p is assumed only to lie in a large nonparametric smoothness class. Estimators proposed for the Gaussian case converge in high dimensions when the Gaussian assumption holds, but are brittle, failing dramatically when p is not Gaussian, while estimators proposed for the nonparametric case fail to converge with realistic sample sizes except in very low dimension. Hence, there is a lack of robust mutual information estimators for many realistic data. To address this, we propose estimators for mutual information when p is assumed to be a nonparanormal (or Gaussian copula) model, a semiparametric compromise between Gaussian and nonparametric extremes. Using theoretical bounds and experiments, we show these estimators strike a practical balance between robustness and scalability.", "title": "Nonparanormal Information Estimation"}
