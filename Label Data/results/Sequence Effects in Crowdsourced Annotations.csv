Deep learning models work best when trained on large amounts of labeled data.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, acquiring labels is costly, motivating the need for effective semi-supervised learning techniques that leverage unlabeled examples.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A widely successful semi-supervised learning strategy for neural NLP is pre-training word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More recent work trains a Bi-LSTM sentence encoder to do language modeling and then incorporates its context-sensitive representations into supervised models (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,
1Code will be made available at https: //github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/ master/research/cvt_text
2018).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Such pre-training methods perform unsupervised representation learning on a large corpus of unlabeled data followed by supervised training.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A key disadvantage of pre-training is that the first representation learning phase does not take advantage of labeled data – the model attempts to learn generally effective representations rather than ones that are targeted towards a particular task.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Older semi-supervised learning algorithms like self-training do not suffer from this problem because they continually learn about a task on a mix of labeled and unlabeled data.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Selftraining has historically been effective for NLP (Yarowsky, 1995; McClosky et al., 2006), but is less commonly used with neural models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper presents Cross-View Training (CVT), a new self-training algorithm that works well for neural sequence models.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In self-training, the model learns as normal on labeled examples.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On unlabeled examples, the model acts as both a teacher that makes predictions about the examples and a student that is trained on those predictions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although this process has shown value for some tasks, it is somewhat tautological: the model already produces the predictions it is being trained on.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent research on computer vision addresses this by adding noise to the student’s input, training the model so it is robust to input perturbations (Sajjadi et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2018).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, applying noise is difficult for discrete inputs like text.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a solution, we take inspiration from multiview learning (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Xu et al., 2013) and train the model to produce consistent predictions across different views of the input.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead of only training the full model as a student, CVT adds auxiliary prediction modules – neural networks that transform vector representations into predictions – to the model and also trains them as students.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The input to each student prediction module is a subset of the model’s intermediate rep-
resentations corresponding to a restricted view of the input example.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, one auxiliary prediction module for sequence tagging is attached to only the “forward” LSTM in the model’s first BiLSTM layer, so it makes predictions without seeing any tokens to the right of the current one.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
CVT works by improving the model’s representation learning.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The auxiliary prediction modules can learn from the full model’s predictions because the full model has a better, unrestricted view of the input.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As the auxiliary modules learn to make accurate predictions despite their restricted views of the input, they improve the quality of the representations they are built on top of.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This in turn improves the full model, which uses the same shared representations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In short, our method combines the idea of representation learning on unlabeled data with classic self-training.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"CVT can be applied to a variety of tasks and neural architectures, but we focus on sequence modeling tasks where the prediction modules are attached to a shared Bi-LSTM encoder.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We propose auxiliary prediction modules that work well for sequence taggers, graph-based dependency parsers, and sequence-to-sequence models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We evaluate our approach on English dependency parsing, combinatory categorial grammar supertagging, named entity recognition, partof-speech tagging, and text chunking, as well as English to Vietnamese machine translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
CVT improves over previously published results on all these tasks.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, CVT can easily and effectively be combined with multi-task learning: we just add additional prediction modules for the different tasks on top of the shared Bi-LSTM encoder.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Training a unified model to jointly perform all of the tasks except machine translation improves results (outperforming a multi-task ELMo model) while decreasing the total training time.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We first present Cross-View Training and describe how it can be combined effectively with multi-task learning.,2 Cross-View Training,[0],[0]
See Figure 1 for an overview of the training method.,2 Cross-View Training,[0],[0]
"Let Dl = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xN , yN )} represent a labeled dataset and Dul = {x1, x2, ..., xM} represent an unlabeled dataset We use pθ(y|xi) to denote the output distribution over classes pro-
duced by the model with parameters θ on input xi.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"During CVT, the model alternates learning on a minibatch of labeled examples and learning on a minibatch of unlabeled examples.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"For labeled examples, CVT uses standard cross-entropy loss:
Lsup(θ) = 1 |Dl| ∑
xi,yi∈Dl
CE(yi, pθ(y|xi))
",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"CVT adds k auxiliary prediction modules to the model, which are used when learning on unlabeled examples.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"A prediction module is usually a small neural network (e.g., a hidden layer followed by a softmax layer).",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"Each one takes as input an intermediate representation hj(xi) produced by the model (e.g., the outputs of one of the LSTMs in a Bi-LSTM model).",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
It outputs a distribution over labels pjθ(y|xi).,2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"Each h
j is chosen such that it only uses a part of the input xi; the particular choice
can depend on the task and model architecture.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
We propose variants for several tasks in Section 3.,2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"The auxiliary prediction modules are only used during training; the test-time prediction come from the primary prediction module that produces pθ.
",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"On an unlabeled example, the model first produces soft targets pθ(y|xi) by performing inference.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"CVT trains the auxiliary prediction modules to match the primary prediction module on the unlabeled data by minimizing LCVT(θ) = 1|Dul| ∑ xi∈Dul ∑k j=1D(pθ(y|xi), p j θ(y|xi))
where D is a distance function between probability distributions (we use KL divergence).",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"We hold the primary module’s prediction pθ(y|xi) fixed during training (i.e., we do not back-propagate through it) so the auxiliary modules learn to imitate the primary one, but not vice versa.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
CVT works by enhancing the model’s representation learning.,2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"As the auxiliary modules train, the representations they take as input improve so they are useful for making predictions even when some of the model’s inputs are not available.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"This in turn improves the primary prediction module, which is built on top of the same shared representations.
",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"We combine the supervised and CVT losses into the total loss, L = Lsup + LCVT, and minimize it with stochastic gradient descent.",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"In particular, we alternate minimizing Lsup over a minibatch of labeled examples and minimizing LCVT over a minibatch of unlabeled examples.
",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
"For most neural networks, adding a few additional prediction modules is computationally cheap compared to the portion of the model building up representations (such as an RNN or CNN).",2.1 Method,[0],[0]
Therefore our method contributes little overhead to training time over other self-training approaches for most tasks.,2.1 Method,[0],[0]
CVT does not change inference time or the number of parameters in the fullytrained model because the auxiliary prediction modules are only used during training.,2.1 Method,[0.9544459604672754],"['Accordingly, we test the statistical significance of 2η is not included in the case of logistic regression the β1 6= 0 to determine whether sequencing effects are present in crowdsourced text corpora.']"
CVT can easily be combined with multi-task learning by adding additional prediction modules for the other tasks on top of the shared Bi-LSTM encoder.,2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
"During supervised learning, we randomly select a task and then update Lsup using a minibatch of labeled data for that task.",2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
"When learning on the unlabeled data, we optimize LCVT
jointly across all tasks at once, first running inference with all the primary prediction modules and then learning from the predictions with all the auxiliary prediction modules.",2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
"As before, the model alternates training on minibatches of labeled and unlabeled examples.
",2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
"Examples labeled across many tasks are useful for multi-task systems to learn from, but most datasets are only labeled with one task.",2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
A benefit of multi-task CVT is that the model creates (artificial) all-tasks-labeled examples from unlabeled data.,2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
This significantly improves the model’s data efficiency and training time.,2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
"Since running prediction modules is computationally cheap, computing LCVT is not much slower for many tasks than it is for a single one.",2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
"However, we find the all-tasks-labeled examples substantially speed up model convergence.",2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
"For example, our model trained on six tasks takes about three times as long to converge as the average model trained on one task, a 2x decrease in total training time.",2.2 Combining CVT with Multi-Task Learning,[0],[0]
CVT relies on auxiliary prediction modules that have restricted views of the input.,3 Cross-View Training Models,[0],[0]
"In this section, we describe specific constructions of the auxiliary prediction modules that are effective for sequence tagging, dependency parsing, and sequence-tosequence learning.",3 Cross-View Training Models,[0],[0]
"All of our models use a two-layer CNN-BiLSTM (Chiu and Nichols, 2016; Ma and Hovy, 2016) sentence encoder.",3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]
It takes as input a sequence of words xi =,3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]
"[x1i , x 2 i , ..., x T i ].",3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]
"First, each word is represented as the sum of an embedding vector and the output of a character-level Convolutional Neural Network, resulting in a sequence of vectors v =",3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]
"[v1, v2, ..., vT ].",3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]
"The encoder applies a twolayer bidirectional LSTM (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005) to these representations.",3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]
"The first layer runs a Long Short-Term Memory unit (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) in the forward direction (taking vt as input at each step t) and the backward direction (taking vT−t+1 at each step) to produce vector sequences [ −→ h 11, −→ h 21, ...",3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]

"The second Bi-LSTM layer
works the same, producing outputs h2, except it takes h1 as input instead of v.",3.1 Bi-LSTM Sentence Encoder,[0],[0]
"In sequence tagging, each token xti has a corresponding label yti .",3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
"The primary prediction module for sequence tagging produces a probability distribution over classes for the tth label using a onehidden-layer neural network applied to the corresponding encoder outputs:
p(yt|xi) = NN(ht1 ⊕ ht2) = softmax(U · ReLU(W (ht1 ⊕ ht2))",3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
"+ b)
",3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
"The auxiliary prediction modules take −→ h 1(xi) and ←− h 1(xi), the outputs of the forward and backward LSTMs in the first2 Bi-LSTM layer, as inputs.",3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
"We add the following four auxiliary prediction modules to the model (see Figure 2):

"t+11 (xi))
The “forward” module makes each prediction without seeing the right context of the current token.",3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
The “future” module makes each prediction without the right context or the current token itself.,3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
"Therefore it works like a neural language model that, instead of predicting which token comes next in the sequence, predicts which class of token comes next.",3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
The “backward” and “past” modules are analogous.,3.2 CVT for Sequence Tagging,[0],[0]
"In a dependency parse, words in a sentence are treated as nodes in a graph.",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Typed directed edges connect the words, forming a tree structure describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"In particular, each word xti in a sentence",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"xi = x 1 i , ..., x T i receives exactly one in-going edge (u, t, r) going from word xui (called the “head”) to it (the “dependent”) of type r (the “relation”).",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
We use a graph-based dependency parser similar to the one from Dozat and Manning (2017).,3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
This treats dependency parsing as a classification task where the goal is to predict which in-going edge yti =,3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"(u, t, r) connects to each word x t i.
First, the representations produced by the encoder for the candidate head and dependent are

A bilinear classifier applied to these representations produces a score for each candidate edge.,3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Lastly, these scores are passed through a softmax layer to produce probabilities.",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Mathematically, the probability of an edge is given as:
pθ((u, t, r)|xi) ∝",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"es(h u 1 (xi)⊕hu2 (xi),ht1(xi)⊕ht2(xi),r)

"+W )
",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"ReLU(Wdepz2 + bdep)
",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
The bilinear classifier uses a weight matrix Wr specific to the candidate relation as well as a weight matrix W shared across all relations.,3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Note that unlike in most prior work, our dependency parser only takes words as inputs, not words and part-of-speech tags.

",3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
Each one has some missing context (not seeing either the preceding or following words) for the candidate head and candidate dependent.,3.3 CVT for Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"We use an encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence model with attention (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015).",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"Each example consists of an input (source) sequence xi = x1i , ..., x T i and output (target) sequence yi = y1i , ..., y K i .",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"The encoder’s representations are passed into an LSTM decoder using a bilinear attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015).",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"In particular, at each time step t the decoder computes an attention distribution over source sequence hidden states as αj ∝ eh
jWαh̄t where h̄t is the decoder’s current hidden state.",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"The source hidden states weighted by the attention distribution form a context vector: ct = ∑ j αjh
j .",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"Next, the context vector and current hidden state are combined into an attention vector at = tanh(Wa[ct, ht]).",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"Lastly, a softmax layer predicts the next token in the output sequence: p(yti |y<ti , xi) = softmax(Wsat).
",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
We add two auxiliary decoders when applying CVT.,3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"The auxiliary decoders share embedding and LSTM parameters with the primary decoder, but have different parameters for the attention mechanisms and softmax layers.",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"For the first one, we restrict its view of the input by applying attention dropout, randomly zeroing out a fraction of its attention weights.",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"The second one is trained to predict the next word in the target sequence rather than the current one: pfutureθ (y t i |y<ti , xi) = softmax(W futures a future t−1 ).",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"Since there is no target sequence for unlabeled examples, we cannot apply teacher forcing to get an output distribution over the vocabulary from the primary decoder at each time step.",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"Instead, we produce hard targets for the auxiliary modules by running the primary decoder with beam search on the input sequence.",3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
This idea has previously been applied to sequence-level knowledge distillation by Kim and Rush (2016).,3.4 CVT for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,[0],[0]
"We compare Cross-View Training against several strong baselines on seven tasks:

"We use the 1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2014) as a pool of unlabeled sentences for semi-supervised learning.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We apply dropout during training, but not when running the primary prediction module to produce soft targets on unlabeled examples.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"In addition to the auxiliary prediction modules listed in Section 3, we find it slightly improves results to add another one that sees the whole input rather than a subset (but unlike the primary prediction module, does have dropout applied to its representations).",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"Unless indicated otherwise, our models have LSTMs with 1024-sized hidden states and 512-sized projection layers.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
See the supplementary material for full training details and hyperparameters.,4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"We compare CVT with the following other semi-supervised learning algorithms:
Word Dropout.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"In this method, we only train the primary prediction module.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"When acting as a teacher it is run as normal, but when acting as a student, we randomly replace some of the input words with a REMOVED token.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
This is similar to CVT in that it exposes the model to a restricted view of the input.,4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"However, it is less data efficient.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"By carefully designing the auxiliary prediction modules, it is possible to train the auxiliary prediction modules to match the primary one across many different views of the input a once, rather than just one view at a time.
",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT).,4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"VAT (Miyato et al., 2016) works like word dropout, but adds noise to the word embeddings of the student instead of dropping out words.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"Notably, the noise is chosen adversarially so it most changes the model’s prediction.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"This method was applied successfully to semi-supervised text classification
by Miyato et al. (2017).
ELMo.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
ELMo incorporates the representations from a large separately-trained language model into a task-specific model.,4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
Our implementaiton follows Peters et al. (2018).,4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
"When combining ELMo with multi-task learning, we allow each task to learn its own weights for the ELMo embeddings going into each prediction module.",4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
We found applying dropout to the ELMo embeddings was crucial for achieving good performance.,4.1 Model Details and Baselines,[0],[0]
Results are shown in Table 1.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
CVT on its own outperforms or is comparable to the best previously published results on all tasks.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Figure 3 shows an example win for CVT over supervised learning.
",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Of the prior results listed in Table 1, only TagLM and ELMo are semi-supervised.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
These methods first train an enormous language model on unlabeled data and incorporate the representations produced by the language model into a supervised classifier.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Our base models use 1024 hidden units in their LSTMs (compared to 4096 in ELMo), require fewer training steps (around one pass over the billion-word benchmark rather than
many passes), and do not require a pipelined training procedure.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Therefore, although they perform on par with ELMo, they are faster and simpler to train.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
Increasing the size of our CVT+Multitask model so it has 4096 units in its LSTMs like ELMo improves results further so they are significantly better than the ELMo+Multi-task ones.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"We suspect there could be further gains from combining our method with language model pre-training, which we leave for future work.
",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
CVT + Multi-Task.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
We train a single sharedencoder CVT model to perform all of the tasks except machine translation (as it is quite different and requires more training time than the other ones).,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Multi-task learning improves results on all of the tasks except fine-grained NER, sometimes by large margins.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
Prior work on many-task NLP such as Hashimoto et al. (2017) uses complicated architectures and training algorithms.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Our result shows that simple parameter sharing can be enough for effective many-task learning when the model is big and trained on a large amount of data.
",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, multi-task learning works better in conjunction with CVT than with ELMo.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"We hypothesize that the ELMo models quickly fit to the data primarily using the ELMo vectors, which perhaps hinders the model from learning effective representations that transfer across tasks.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"We also believe CVT alleviates the danger of the model “forgetting” one task while training on the other ones, a well-known problem in many-task learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"During multi-task CVT, the model makes predictions about unlabeled examples across all tasks, creating (artificial) all-tasks-labeled examples, so the model does not only see one task at a time.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"In fact, multi-task learning plus self training is similar to the Learning without Forgetting algorithm (Li and Hoiem, 2016), which trains the model to keep its predictions on an old task unchanged when learning a new task.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"To test the value of all-tasks-labeled examples, we trained a multi-task CVT model that only computes LCVT on one task at a time (chosen randomly for each unlabeled minibatch) instead of for all tasks in parallel.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"The one-at-a-time model performs substantially worse (see Table 2).
",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
Model Generalization.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"In order to evaluate how our models generalize to the dev set from the train set, we plot the dev vs. train accuracy for our different methods as they learn (see Figure 4).",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Both CVT and multi-task learning improve model generalization: for the same train accuracy, the models get better dev accuracy than purely supervised learning.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, CVT continues to improve
in dev set accuracy while close to 100% train accuracy for CCG, Chunking, and NER, perhaps because the model is still learning from unlabeled data even when it has completely fit to the train set.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
We also show results for a smaller multi-task + CVT model.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Although it generalizes at least as well as the larger one, it halts making progress on the train set earlier.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"This suggests it is important to use sufficiently large neural networks for multitask learning: otherwise the model does not have the capacity to fit to all the training data.
",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
Auxiliary Prediction Module Ablation.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
We briefly explore which auxiliary prediction modules are more important for the sequence tagging tasks in Table 3.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"We find that both kinds of auxiliary prediction modules improve performance, but that the future and past modules improve results more than the forward and backward ones, perhaps because they see a more restricted and challenging view of the input.
",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
Training Models on Small Datasets.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"We explore how CVT scales with dataset size by varying the amount of training data the model has ac-
cess to.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Unsurprisingly, the improvement of CVT over purely supervised learning grows larger as the amount of labeled data decreases (see Figure 5, left).",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Using only 25% of the labeled data, our approach already performs as well or better than a fully supervised model using 100% of the training data, demonstrating that CVT is particularly useful on small datasets.

Generalizable Representations.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we explore training the CVT+multi-task model on five tasks, freezing the encoder, and then only training a prediction module on the sixth task.",4.2 Results,[0],[0]
This tests whether the encoder’s representations generalize to a new task not seen during its training.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]
Only training the prediction module is very fast because (1) the encoder (which is by far the slowest part of the model) has to be run over each example only once and (2) we do not back-propagate into the encoder.,4.2 Results,[0],[0]

"One of the earliest approaches to semi-supervised learning is self-training (Scudder, 1965), which has been successfully applied to NLP tasks such as word-sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995) and parsing (McClosky et al., 2006).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In each round of training, the classifier, acting as a “teacher,” labels some of the unlabeled data and adds it to the training set.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Then, acting as a “student,” it is retrained on the new training set.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Many recent approaches (including the consistentency regularization methods discussed below and our own method) train the student with soft targets from the teacher’s output distribution rather than a hard label, making the procedure more akin to knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]

Consistency Regularization.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recent works add noise (e.g., drawn from a Gaussian distribution) or apply stochastic transformations (e.g., horizontally flipping an image) to the student’s inputs.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This trains the model to give consistent predictions to nearby data points, encouraging distributional smoothness in the model.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Consistency regularization has been very successful for computer vision applications (Bachman et al., 2014; Laine and Aila, 2017; Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, stochastic input alterations are more difficult to apply to discrete data like text, making consistency regularization less used for natural language processing.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"One solution is to add noise to the model’s word embeddings (Miyato et al., 2017); we compare against this approach in our experiments.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]

"User geolocation, the task of identifying the “home” location of a user, is an integral component of many applications ranging from public health monitoring (Paul and Dredze, 2011; Chon et al., 2015; Yepes et al., 2015) and regional studies of sentiment, to real-time emergency awareness systems (De Longueville et al., 2009; Sakaki et al., 2010), which use social media as an implicit information resource about people.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Social media services such as Twitter rely on IP addresses, WiFi footprints, and GPS data to geolocate users.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third-party service providers don’t have easy access to such information, and have to rely on public sources of geolocation information such as the profile location field, which is noisy and difficult to map to a location (Hecht et al., 2011), or geotagged tweets, which are publicly available for only 1% of tweets (Cheng et al., 2010; Morstatter et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The scarcity of publicly available
location information motivates predictive user geolocation from information such as tweet text and social interaction data.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most previous work on user geolocation takes the form of either supervised text-based approaches (Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Han et al., 2012) relying on the geographical variation of language use, or graph-based semi-supervised label propagation relying on location homophily in user–user interactions (Davis Jr et al., 2011; Jurgens, 2013).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Both text and network views are critical in geolocating users.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Some users post a lot of local content, but their social network is lacking or is not representative of their location; for them, text is the dominant view for geolocation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Other users have many local social interactions, and mostly use social media to read other people’s comments, and for interacting with friends.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Single-view learning would fail to accurately geolocate these users if the more information-rich view is not present.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There has been some work that uses both the text and network views, but it either completely ignores unlabelled data (Li et al., 2012a; Miura et al., 2017), or just uses unlabelled data in the network view (Rahimi et al., 2015b; Do et al., 2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given that the 1% of geotagged tweets is often used for supervision, it is crucial for geolocation models to be able to leverage unlabelled data, and to perform well under a minimal supervision scenario.

"Our contributions are: (1) we evaluate our model under a minimal supervision scenario which is close to real world applications and show that GCN outperforms two strong baselines; (2) given sufficient supervision, we show that GCN is competitive, although the much simpler MLP-TXT+NET outper-
forms state-of-the-art models; and (3) we show that highway gates play a significant role in controlling the amount of useful neighbourhood smoothing in GCN.1",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
Text-based geolocation uses the geographical bias in language use to infer the location of users.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"There are three main text-based approaches to geolocation: (1) gazetteer-based models which map geographical references in text to location, but ignore non-geographical references and vernacular uses of language (Rauch et al., 2003; Amitay et al., 2004; Lieberman et al., 2010); (2) geographical topic models that learn region-specific topics, but don’t scale to the magnitude of social media (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2012; Ahmed et al., 2013); and (3) supervised models which are often framed as text classification (Serdyukov et al., 2009; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Roller et al., 2012; Han et al., 2014) or text regression (Iso et al., 2017; Rahimi et al., 2017a).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Supervised models scale well and can achieve good performance with sufficient supervision, which is not available in a real world scenario.
",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
Network-based methods leverage the location homophily assumption: nearby users are more likely to befriend and interact with each other.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"There are four main network-based geolocation approaches: distance-based, supervised classification, graph-based label propagation, and node embedding methods.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Distance-based methods model the probability of friendship given the distance (Backstrom et al., 2010; McGee et al., 2013; Gu et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2014), supervised models use neighbourhood features to classify a user into a location (Rout et al., 2013; Malmi et al., 2015), and graph-based label-propagation models propagate the location information through the user–user graph to estimate unknown labels (Davis Jr et al., 2011; Jurgens, 2013; Compton et al., 2014).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Node embedding methods build heterogeneous graphs between user–user, user–location and location– location, and learn an embedding space to minimise the distance of connected nodes, and maximise the distance of disconnected nodes.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The embeddings are then used in supervised models for geolocation (Wang et al., 2017).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
Network-based models fail to geolocate disconnected users: Jurgens et al. (2015) couldn’t geolocation 37% of users as a result of disconnectedness.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Previous work on hybrid text and network methods can be broadly categorised into three main approaches: (1) incorporating text-based information such as toponyms or locations predicted from a textbased model as auxiliary nodes into the user–user graph, which is then used in network-based models (Li et al., 2012a,b; Rahimi et al., 2015b,a); (2) ensembling separately trained text- and networkbased models (Gu et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2012; Jayasinghe et al., 2016; Ribeiro and Pappa, 2017); and (3) jointly learning geolocation from several information sources such as text and network information (Miura et al., 2017; Do et al., 2017), which can capture the complementary information in text and network views, and also model the interactions between the two.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"None of the previous
multiview approaches — with the exception of Li et al. (2012a) and Li et al. (2012b) that only use toponyms — effectively uses unlabelled data in the text view, and use only the unlabelled information of the network view via the user–user graph.
",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"There are three main shortcomings in the previous work on user geolocation that we address in this paper: (1) with the exception of few recent works (Miura et al., 2017; Do et al., 2017), previous models don’t jointly exploit both text and network information, and therefore the interaction between text and network views is not modelled; (2) the unlabelled data in both text and network views is not effectively exploited, which is crucial given the small amounts of available supervision; and (3) previous models are rarely evaluated under a minimal supervision scenario, a scenario which reflects real world conditions.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]

"We showed that joint modelling of text and network information outperforms network-only, text-only, and hybrid geolocation models as a result of modelling the interaction between text and network information.",6 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We also showed that GCN and DCCA are able to perform well under a minimal supervision scenario similar to real world applications by effectively using unlabelled data.,6 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"The current state-of-the-art systems for automatic sentence-alignment of original and manually simplified texts are the GSWN method (Hwang et al., 2015) used for sentence-alignment of original and simple English Wikipedia, and the HMMbased method (Bott and Saggion, 2011) used for sentence-alignment of the Spanish Simplext corpus (Saggion et al., 2015).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The HMM-based method can be applied to any language as it does not require any languagespecific resources.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"It is based on two hypotheses: (H1) that the original order of information is preserved, and (H2) that every ‘simple’ sentence has at least one corresponding ‘original’ sentence (it can have more than one in the case of ‘n-1’ or ‘nm’ alignments).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As Simple Wikipedia does not represent direct simplification of the ‘original’ Wikipedia articles (‘simple’ articles were written independently of the ‘original’ ones), GSWN method does not assume H1 or H2.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The main limitations of this method are that it only allows for ‘1-1’ sentence alignments – which is very restricting for TS as it does not allow for sentence splitting (‘1-n’), and summarisation and compression (‘n-1’ and ‘n-m’) alignments – and it is language-dependent as it requires English Wiktionary.

"It is probably even more common to operate on syntactic trees directly (dependency or constituency) and generate compressions by pruning them (Knight & Marcu, 2000; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Filippova & Altun, 2013, among others).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"While phenomena like long-distance relations may seem to make generation of grammatically correct compressions impossible, we are going to present an evidence to the contrary.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In particular, we will present a model which benefits from the very recent advances in deep learning and uses word embeddings and Long Short Term Memory models (LSTMs) to output surprisingly readable and informative compressions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Trained on a corpus of less than two million automatically extracted parallel sentences and using a standard tool to obtain word embeddings, in its best and most simple configuration it achieves 4.5 points out of 5 in readability and 3.8 points in informativeness in an extensive evaluation with human judges.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We believe that this is an important result as it may suggest a new direction for sentence compression research which is less tied to modeling linguistic
360
structures, especially syntactic ones, than the compression work so far.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The paper is organized as follows: Section 3 presents a competitive baseline which implements the system of McDonald (2006) for large training sets.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The LSTM model and its three configurations are introduced in Section 4.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The evaluation set-up and a discussion on wins and losses with examples are presented in Section 5 which is followed by the conclusions.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The problem formulation we adopt in this paper is very simple: for every token in the input sentence we ask whether it should be kept or dropped, which translates into a sequence labeling problem with just two labels: one and zero.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The deletion approach is a standard one in compression research, although the problem is often formulated over the syntactic structure and not the raw token sequence.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"That is, one usually drops constituents or prunes dependency edges (Jing, 2000; Knight & Marcu, 2000; McDonald, 2006; Clarke & Lapata, 2008; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Filippova & Altun, 2013).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Thus, the relation to existing compression work is that we also use the deletion approach.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Recent advances in machine learning made it possible to escape the typical paradigm of mapping a fixed dimensional input to a fixed dimensional output to mapping an input sequence onto an output sequence.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Even though many of these models were proposed more than a decade ago, it is not until recently that they have empirically been shown to perform well.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Indeed, core problems in natural language processing such as translation (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2014), parsing (Vinyals et al., 2014), image captioning (Vinyals et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015), or learning to execute small programs (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2014) employed virtually the same principles—the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Thus, with regard to this line of research, our work comes closest to the recent machine translation work.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"An important difference is that we do not aim at building a model that generates compressions directly but rather a model which generates a sequence of deletion decisions.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"A more complex translation model is also conceivable and may significantly advance work on compression by paraphrasing, of which there have
not been many examples yet (Cohn & Lapata, 2008).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, in this paper our goal is to demonstrate that a simple but robust deletionbased system can be built without using any linguistic features other than token boundaries.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
We leave experiments with paraphrasing models to future work.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
We compare our model against the system of McDonald (2006) which also formulates sentence compression as a binary sequence labeling problem.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"In contrast to our proposal, it makes use of a large set of syntactic features which are treated as soft evidence.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
The presence or absence of these features is treated as signals which do not condition the output that the model can produce.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Therefore the model is robust against noise present in the precomputed syntactic structures of the input sentences.
",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
The system was implemented based on the description by McDonald (2006) with two changes which were necessary due to the large size of the training data set used for model fitting.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"The first change was related to the learning procedure and the second one to the family of features used.
",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Regarding the learning procedure, the original model uses a large-margin learning framework, namely MIRA (Crammer & Singer, 2003), but with some minor changes as presented by McDonald et al. (2005).",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"In this set-up, online learning is performed, and at each step an optimization procedure is made where K constraints are included, which correspond to the top-K solutions for a given training observation.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"This optimization step is equivalent to a Quadratic Programming problem if K > 1, which is time-costly to solve, and therefore not adequate for the large amount of data we used for training the model.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, in his publication McDonald states clearly that different values of K did not actually have a major impact on the final performance of the model.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Consequently, and for the sake of being able to successfully train the model with largescale data, the learning procedure is implemented as a distributed structured perceptron with iterative parameter mixing (McDonald et al., 2010), where each shard is processed with MIRA and K is set to 1.
Setting K = 1 will only affect the weight update described on line 4 of Figure 3 of McDonald
(2006), which is now expressed as:
w(i+1) ← w(i)",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"+ τ × eyt,y′ where τ = max ( 0, L(yt,y′)−w · eyt,y′ ||eyt,y′ ||2 )
eyt,y′ =",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"F (xt,yt)− F (xt,y′) y′",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
= best(x; w(i)),3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"F (x,y) = |y|∑ j=2 f(x, I(yj−1), I(yj))
",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
The second change concerns the feature set used.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"While McDonald’s original model contains deep syntactic features coming from both dependency and constituency parse trees, we use only dependency-based features.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Additionally, and to better compare the baseline with the LSTM models, we have included as an optional feature a 256-dimension embedding-vector representation of each input word and its syntactic parent.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"The vectors are pre-trained using the Skipgram model1 (Mikolov et al., 2013).",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Ultimately, our implementation of McDonald’s model contained 463,614 individual features, summarized in three categories: • PoS features: Joint PoS tags of selected to-
kens.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Unigram, bigram and trigram PoS context of selected and dropped tokens.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
All the previous features conjoined with one indicating if the last two selected tokens are adjacent.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
•,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Deep syntactic features: Dependency labels
of taken and dropped tokens and their parent dependencies.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"Boolean features indicating syntactic relations between selected tokens (i.e., siblings, parents, leaves, etc.).",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
Dependency label of the least common ancestor in the dependency tree between a batch of dropped tokens.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
All the previous features conjoined with the PoS tag of the involved tokens.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"• Word features: Boolean features indicating
if a group of dropped nodes contain a complete or incomplete parenthesization.",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
Wordembedding vectors of selected and dropped tokens and their syntactic parents.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
"The model is fitted over ten epochs on the whole training data, and for model selection a small development set consisting of 5,000 previously unseen sentences is used (none of them belonging to
1https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
the evaluation set).",3 Baseline,[0],[0]
The automated metric used for this selection was accuracy@1 which is the proportion of golden compressions which could be fully reproduced.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
The performance on the development set plateaus when getting close to the last epoch.,3 Baseline,[0],[0]
Our approach is largely based on the sequence to sequence paradigm proposed in Sutskever et al. (2014).,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
We train a model that maximizes the probability of the correct output given the input sentence.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Concretely, for each training pair (X,Y ), we will learn a parametric model (with parameters θ), by solving the following optimization problem:
θ∗ = arg max θ ∑ X,Y log p(Y |X; θ) (1)
where the sum is assumed to be over all training examples.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"To model the probability p, we use the same architecture described by Sutskever et al. (2014).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"In particular, we use a RNN based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) unit (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), designed to avoid vanishing gradients and to remember some long-distance dependences from the input sequence.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
Figure 1 shows a basic LSTM architecture.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The RNN is fed with input words Xi (one at a time), until we feed a special symbol “GO”.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"It is now a common practice (Sutskever et al., 2014; Li & Jurafsky, 2015) to start feeding the input in reversed order, as it has been shown to perform better empirically.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"During the first pass over the input, the network is expected to learn a compact, distributed representation of the input sentence, which will allow it to start generating the right predictions when the second pass starts, after the “GO” symbol is read.
",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"We can apply the chain rule to decompose Equation (1) as follows:
p(Y |X; θ) = T∏ t=1 p(Yt|Y1, . . .",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
", Yt−1, X; θ) (2)
noting that we made no independence assumptions.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Once we find the optimal θ∗, we construct our estimated compression Ŷ as:
Ŷ = arg max Y
p(Y |X; θ∗) (3)
LSTM cell: Let us review the sequence-tosequence LSTM model.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
The Long Short Term Memory model of Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) is defined as follows.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Let xt, ht, and mt be the input, control state, and memory state at timestep t. Then, given a sequence of inputs (x1, . . .",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
", xT ), the LSTM computes the h-sequence (h1, . . .",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
", hT ) and the m-sequence (m1, . . .",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
",mT ) as follows

"sigm(W1xt +W2ht−1) i′t = tanh(W3xt +W4ht−1) ft = sigm(W5xt +W6ht−1) ot = sigm(W7xt +W8ht−1) mt = mt−1 ft + it i′t ht = mt ot
The operator denotes element-wise multiplication, the matrices W1, . . .",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
",W8 and the vector h0 are the parameters of the model, and all the nonlinearities are computed element-wise.

Stochastic gradient descent is used to maximize the training objective (Eq. (1)),4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
w.r.t.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"all the LSTM parameters.
",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
Network architecture:,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
In these experiments we have used the architecture depicted in Figure 3.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Following Vinyals et al. (2014), we have used three stacked LSTM layers to allow the upper layers to learn higher-order representations of the input, interleaved with dropout layers to prevent overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The output layer is a SoftMax classifier that predicts, after the “GO” symbol is read, one of the following three
labels: 1, if a word is to be retained in the compression, 0 if a word is to be deleted, or EOS, which is the output label used for the “GO” input and the end-of-sentence final period.
",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Input representation: In the simplest implementation, that we call LSTM, the input layer has 259 dimensions.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The first 256 contain the embedding-vector representation of the current in-
put word, pre-trained using the Skipgram model2",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"(Mikolov et al., 2013).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The final three dimensions contain a one-hot-spot representation of the goldstandard label of the previous word (during training), or the generated label of the previous word (during decoding).
",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"For the LSTM+PAR architecture we first parse the input sentence, and then we provide as input, for each input word, the embedding-vector representation of that word and its parent word in the dependency tree.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"If the current input is the root node, then a special parent embedding is constructed with all nodes set to zero except for one node.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
In these settings we want to test the hypothesis whether knowledge about the parent node can be useful to decide if the current constituent is relevant or not for the compression.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
The dimensionality of the input layer in this case is 515.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Similarly to McDonald (2006), syntax is used here as a soft feature in the model.
",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"For the LSTM+PAR+PRES architecture, we again parse the input sentence, and use a 518-sized embedding vector, that includes: • The embedding vector for the current word
(256 dimensions).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"• The embedding vector for the parent word
(256 dimensions).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"• The label predicted for the last word (3 di-
mensions).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"• A bit indicating whether the parent word has 2https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
already been seen and kept in the compression (1 dimension).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"• A bit indicating whether the parent word has
already been seen but discarded (1 dimension).",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"• A bit indicating whether the parent word
comes later in the input (1 dimension).
",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
Decoding: Eq. (3) involves searching through all possible output sequences (given X).,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Contrary to the baseline, in the case of LSTMs the complete previous history is taken into account for each prediction and we cannot simplify Eq.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
(2) with a Markov assumption.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the search space at decoding time is exponential on the length of the input, and we have used a beam-search procedure as described in Figure 2.
",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"Fixed parameters: For training, we unfold the network 120 times and make sure that none of our training instances is longer than that.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
"The learning rate is initialized at 2, with a decay factor of 0.96 every 300,000 traning steps.",4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
The dropping probability for the dropout layers is 0.2.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
The number of nodes in each LSTM layer is always identical to the number of nodes in the input layer.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
We have not tuned these parameters nor the number of stacked layers.,4 The LSTM model,[0],[0]
Both the LSTM systems we introduced and the baseline require a training set of a considerable size.,5.1 Data,[0],[0]
"In particular, the LSTM model uses 256- dimensional embeddings of token sequences and cannot be expected to perform well if trained on a thousand parallel sentences, which is the size of the commonly used data sets (Knight & Marcu, 2000; Clarke & Lapata, 2006).",5.1 Data,[0],[0]
"Following the method of Filippova & Altun (2013), we collect a much larger corpus of about two million parallel sentence-compression instances from the news where every compression is a subsequence of tokens from the input.",5.1 Data,[0],[0]
"For testing, we use the publicly released set of 10,000 sentence-compression pairs3.",5.1 Data,[0],[0]
"We take the first 200 sentences from this set for the manual evaluation with human raters, and the first 1,000 sentences for the automatic evaluation.",5.1 Data,[0],[0]
We evaluate the baseline and our systems on the 200-sentence test set in an experiment with human raters.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
The raters were asked to rate readability and informativeness of compressions given the input which are the standard evaluation metrics for compression.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The former covers the grammatical correctness, comprehensibility and fluency of the output while the latter measures the amount of important content preserved in the compression.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Additionally, for experiments on the development set, we used two metrics for automatic evaluation: per-sentence accuracy (i.e., how many compressions could be fully reproduced) and word-based F1-score.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
The latter differs from the RASP-based relation F-score by Riezler et al. (2003) in that we simply compute the recall and precision in terms of tokens kept in the golden and the generated compressions.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We report these results for completeness although it is the results of the human evaluation from which we draw our conclusions.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
Compression ratio:,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
The three versions of our system (LSTM*) and the baseline (MIRA) have comparable compression ratios (CR) which are defined as the length of the compression in characters divided over the sentence length.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Since the
3http://storage.googleapis.com/ sentencecomp/compressiondata.json
ratios are very close, a comparison of the systems’ scores is justified (Napoles et al., 2011).
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Automatic evaluation: A total of 1,000 sentence pairs from the test set4 were used in the automatic evaluation.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The results are summarized in Table 1.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"There is a significant difference in performance of the MIRA baseline and the LSTM models, both in terms of F1-score and in accuracy.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
More than 30% of golden compressions could be fully regenerated by the LSTM systems which is in sharp contrast with the 20% of MIRA.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The differences in F-score between the three versions of LSTM are not significant, all scores are close to 0.81.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Evaluation with humans: The first 200 sentences from the set of 1,000 used in the automatic evaluation were compressed by each of the four systems.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Every sentence-compression pair was rated by three raters who were asked to select a rating on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from one to five.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
In very few cases (around 1%),5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"the ratings were inconclusive (i.e., 1, 3, 5 were given to the same pair) and had to be skipped.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Table 2 summarizes the results.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
The results indicate that the LSTM models produce more readable and more informative compressions.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, there is no benefit in using the syntactic information, at least not with
4We used the very first 1,000 instances.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
the amount of parallel data we had at our disposal.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The simple LSTM model which only uses token embeddings to generate a sequence of deletion decisions significantly outperforms the baseline which was given not only embeddings but also syntactic and other features.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
Discussion: What are the wins and losses of the LSTM systems?,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
Figure 4 presents some of the evaluated sentence-compression pairs.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In terms of readability, the basic LSTM system performed surprisingly well.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
Only in a few cases (out of 200) did it get an average score of two or three.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Sentences which pose difficulty to the model are the ones with quotes, intervening commas, or other uncommon punctuation patterns.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For example, in the second sentence in Figure 4, if one removes from the input the age modifiers and the preceding commas, the words and Chris Martin are not
dropped and the output compression is grammatical, preserving both conjoined elements.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"With regard to informativeness, the difficult cases are those where there is very little to be removed and where the model still removed more than a half to achieve the compression ratio it observed in the training data.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For example, the only part that can be removed from the fourth sentence in Figure 4 is the modifier of police, everything else being important content.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Similarly, in the fifth sentence the context of the event must be retained in the compression for the event to be interpreted correctly.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Arguably, such cases would also be difficult for other systems.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In particular, recognizing when the context is crucial is a problem that can be solved only by including deep semantic and discourse features which has not been attempted yet.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"And
sentences with quotes (direct speech, a song or a book title, etc.) are challenging for parsers which in turn provide important signals for most compression systems.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
The bottom of Figure 4 contains examples of good compressions.,5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Even though for a significant number of input sentences the compression was a continuous subsequence of tokens, there are many discontinuous compressions.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In particular, the LSTM model learned to drop appositions, no matter how long they are, temporal expressions, optional modifiers, introductory clauses, etc.
",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Our understanding of why the extended model (LSTM+PAR+PRES) performed worse in the human evlauation than the base model is that, in the absence of syntactic features, the basic LSTM learned a model of syntax useful for compression, while LSTM++, which was given syntactic information, learned to optimize for the particular way the ”golden” set was created (tree pruning).",5.2 Experiments,[0.9514634494421441],"['On the other hand, a bad item may make the next item seem better in comparison (Kenrick and Gutierres, 1980; Hartzmark and Shue, to appear) Assimilation and anchoring: The annotator uses their score of the previous item as an anchor, and adjusts the score of the current item from this anchor, based on perceived similarities and differences with the previous item.']"
"While the automatic evaluation penalized all deviations from the single golden variant, in human evals there was no penalty for readable alternatives.",5.2 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We presented, to our knowledge, a first attempt at building a competitive compression system which is given no linguistic features from the input.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"The two important components of the system are (1) word embeddings, which can be obtained by anyone either pre-trained, or by running word2vec on a large corpus, and (2) an LSTM model which draws on the very recent advances in research on RNNs.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"The training data of about two million sentence-compression pairs was collected automatically from the Internet.
",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
Our results clearly indicate that a compression model which is not given syntactic information explicitly in the form of features may still achieve competitive performance.,6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
The high readability and informativeness scores assigned by human raters support this claim.,6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"In the future, we are planning to experiment with more “interesting” paraphrasing models which translate the input not into a zero-one sequence but into words.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We present an LSTM approach to deletion-based sentence compression where the task is to translate a sentence into a sequence of zeros and ones, corresponding to token deletion decisions.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We demonstrate that even the most basic version of the system, which is given no syntactic information (no PoS or NE tags, or dependencies) or desired compression length, performs surprisingly well: around 30% of the compressions from a large test set could be regenerated.",abstractText,[0],[0]
We compare the LSTM system with a competitive baseline which is trained on the same amount of data but is additionally provided with all kinds of linguistic features.,abstractText,[0],[0]
In an experiment with human raters the LSTMbased model outperforms the baseline achieving 4.5 in readability and 3.8 in informativeness.,abstractText,[0],[0]

Sentence compression aims to produce a summary of a single sentence that retains the most important information while preserving its fluency.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The task has attracted much attention due to its potential for applications such as text summarization (Jing, 2000; Madnani et al., 2007; Woodsend and Lapata, 2010; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), subtitle generation (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004; Luotolahti and Ginter, 2015), and the display of text on small-screens (Corston-Oliver, 2001).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The bulk of research on sentence compression has focused on a simplification of the task involving exclusively word deletion (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Riezler et al., 2003; Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2009), whereas a few approaches view sentence compression as a more general text rewriting problem (Galley and McKeown, 2007; Woodsend and Lapata, 2010; Cohn and Lapata, 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Irrespective of how

the compression task is formulated, most previous work relies on syntactic information such as parse trees to help decide what to delete from a sentence or which rules to learn in order to rewrite a sentence using less words.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More recently, there has been much interest in applying neural network models to natural language generation tasks, including sentence compression (Rush et al., 2015; Filippova et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016; Kikuchi et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Filippova et al. (2015) focus on deletion-based sentence compression which they model as a sequence labeling problem using a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Rush et al. (2015) capture the full gamut of rewrite operations drawing insights from encoderdecoder models recently proposed for machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Neural network-based approaches are datadriven, relying on the ability of recurrent architectures to learn continuous features without recourse to preprocessing tools or syntactic information (e.g., part-of-speech tags, parse trees).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In order to achieve good performance, they require large amounts of training data, in the region of millions of long-short sentence pairs.2 Existing compression datasets are several orders of magnitude smaller.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, the ZiffDavis corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2002) contains 1,067 sentences and originated from a collection of news articles on computer products.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Clarke and Lapata (2008) create two manual corpora sampled from written (1,433 sentences) and spoken sources (1,370 sentences).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Cohn and Lapata (2013) elicit manual compressions for 625 sentences taken from newspaper articles.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More recently, Toutanova et al. (2016) crowdsource a larger corpus which contains manual compressions for single and multiple sentences (about 26,000 pairs of source and compressed texts).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"2Rush et al. (2015) use approximately four million training instances and Filippova et al. (2015) two million.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since large scale compression datasets do not occur naturally, they must be somehow approximated, e.g., by pairing headlines with the first sentence of a news article (Filippova and Altun, 2013; Rush et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, the training corpus construction process must be repeated and reconfigured for new languages and domains (e.g., many headline-first sentence pairs are spurious and need to be filtered using language and domain specific heuristics).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"And although it may be easy to automatically obtain large scale training data in the news domain, it is not clear how such data can be sourced for many other genres with different writing conventions.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our work addresses the paucity of data for sentence compression models.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We argue that multilingual corpora are a rich source for learning a variety of rewrite rules across languages and that existing neural machine translation (NMT) models (Sutskever et al. 2014; Bahdanau et al. 2015) can be easily adapted to the compression task through bilingual pivoting (Mallinson et al., 2017) coupled with methods which decode the output sequence to a desired length (e.g., subject to language and genre requirements).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We obtain compressions by translating a source string into a foreign language and then back-translating it into the source while controlling the translation length (Kikuchi et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model can be trained for any language as long as a bilingual corpus is available, and can perform arbitrary rewrites while taking advantage of multiple pivots if these exist.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We also demonstrate that models trained on multilingual data perform well out-of-domain.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

An obvious workaround is to translate Gigaword to French and German and then train compression models on the translated data.,4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"As the quality of the translation is relatively poor, we also translated German or French into English, compressed it with ABS and LenInit trained on the Gigaword corpus, and then translated the compressions back to French or German.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]

"For instance, a simplification component could be used as a preprocessing step to improve the performance of parsers (Chandrasekar et al., 1996), summarizers (Beigman Klebanov et al., 2004), and semantic role labelers (Vickrey and Koller, 2008; Woodsend and Lapata, 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Automatic simplification would also benefit people with low-literacy skills (Watanabe et al., 2009), such as children and

non-native speakers as well as individuals with autism (Evans et al., 2014), aphasia (Carroll et al., 1999), or dyslexia (Rello et al., 2013).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The most prevalent rewrite operations which give rise to simplified text include substituting rare words with more common words or phrases, rendering syntactically complex structures simpler, and deleting elements of the original text (Siddharthan, 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Earlier work focused on individual aspects of the simplification problem.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, several systems performed syntactic simplification only, using rules aimed at sentence splitting (Carroll et al., 1999; Chandrasekar et al., 1996; Vickrey and Koller, 2008; Siddharthan, 2004) while others turned to lexical simplification by substituting difficult words with more common WordNet synonyms or paraphrases (Devlin, 1999; Inui et al., 2003; Kaji et al., 2002).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Recent approaches view the simplification process more holistically as a monolingual textto-text generation task borrowing ideas from statistical machine translation.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Simplification rewrites are learned automatically from examples of complex-simple sentences extracted from online resources such as the ordinary and simple English Wikipedia.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, Zhu et al. (2010) draw inspiration from syntax-based translation and propose a model similar to Yamada and Knight (2001) which additionally performs simplification-specific rewrite operations (e.g., sentence splitting).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Woodsend and Lapata (2011) formulate simplification in the framework of Quasi-synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) and use integer linear programming to score the candidate translations/simplifications.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Wubben et al. (2012) propose a two-stage model: initially, a standard phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) model is trained on complex-simple sentence pairs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"During inference, the K-best outputs of the PBMT model are reranked according
584
to their dis-similarity to the (complex) input sentence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The hybrid model developed in Narayan and Gardent (2014) also operates in two phases.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Initially, a probabilistic model performs sentence splitting and deletion operations over discourse representation structures assigned by Boxer (Curran et al., 2007).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The resulting sentences are further simplified by a model similar to Wubben et al. (2012).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Xu et al. (2016) train a syntax-based machine translation model on a large scale paraphrase dataset (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) using simplification-specific objective functions and features to encourage simpler output.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper we propose a simplification model which draws on insights from neural machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Central to this approach is an encoderdecoder architecture implemented by recurrent neural networks.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The encoder reads the source sequence into a list of continuous-space representations from which the decoder generates the target sequence.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although our model uses the encoder-decoder architecture as its backbone, it must also meet constraints imposed by the simplification task itself, i.e., the predicted output must be simpler, preserve the meaning of the input, and grammatical.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To incorporate this knowledge, the model is trained in a reinforcement learning framework (Williams, 1992): it explores the space of possible simplifications while learning to maximize an expected reward function that encourages outputs which meet simplificationspecific constraints.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Reinforcement learning has been previously applied to extractive summarization (Ryang and Abekawa, 2012), information extraction (Narasimhan et al., 2016), dialogue generation (Li et al., 2016), machine translation, and image caption generation (Ranzato et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We evaluate our system on three publicly available datasets collated automatically from Wikipedia (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011) and human-authored news articles (Xu et al., 2015b).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We experimentally show that the reinforcement learning framework is the key to successful generation of simplified text bringing significant improvements over strong simplification models across datasets.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We will first define a basic encoder-decoder model for sentence simplification and then explain how to embed it in a reinforcement learning
framework.",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
Given a (complex) source sentence X =,2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"(x1, x2, . . .",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
", x|X|), our model learns to predict its simplified target Y = (y1, y2, . . .",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
", y|Y |).",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"Inferring the target Y given the sourceX is a typical sequence to sequence learning problem, which can be modeled with attention-based encoderdecoder models (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015).",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"Sentence simplification is slightly different from related sequence transduction tasks (e.g., compression) in that it can involve splitting operations.",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"For example, a long source sentence (In 1883, Faur married Marie Fremiet, with whom he had two sons.)",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"can be simplified as two sentences (In 1883, Faur married Marie Fremiet.",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
They had two sons.).,2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"Nevertheless, we still view the target as a sequence, i.e., two or more sequences concatenated with full stops.
",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
The encoder-decoder model has two parts (see left hand side in Figure 1).,2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"The encoder transforms the source sentence X into a sequence of hidden states (hS1 ,h S 2 , . . .",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
",h S |X|)",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"with a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997), while the decoder uses another LSTM to generate one word yt+1 at a time in the simplified target Y .",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"Generation is conditioned on all previously generated words y1:t and a dynamically created context vector ct, which encodes the source sentence:
P (Y |X) = |Y |∏ t=1 P (yt|y1:t−1, X) (1)
P (yt+1|y1:t, X) = softmax(g(hTt , ct))",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"(2)
where g(·) is a one-hidden-layer neural network with the following parametrization:
g(hTt , ct) =",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"Wo tanh(Uhh T t + Whct) (3)
where Wo ∈ R|V |×d, Uh ∈ Rd×d, and Wh ∈ Rd×d; |V",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
| is the output vocabulary size and d the hidden unit size.,2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"hTt is the hidden state of the decoder LSTM which summarizes y1:t, i.e., what has been generated so far:
hTt = LSTM(yt,h T t−1) (4)
",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"The dynamic context vector ct is the weighted sum of the hidden states of the source sentence:
ct = |X|∑ i=1",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"αtihSi (5)
whose weights αti are determined by an attention mechanism:
αti = exp(hTt · hSi )∑ i exp(h T t · hSi )
(6)
where · is the dot product between two vectors.",2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
We use the dot product here mainly for efficiency reasons; alternative ways to compute attention scores have been proposed in the literature and we refer the interested reader to Luong et al. (2015).,2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
The model sketched above is usually trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the training source-target pairs.,2 Neural Encoder-Decoder Model,[0],[0]
"In this section we present DRESS, our Deep REinforcement Sentence Simplification model.",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"Despite successful application in numerous sequence transduction tasks (Jean et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2015a), a vanilla encoder-decoder model is not ideal for sentence simplification.",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"Although a number of rewrite operations (e.g., copying, deletion, substitution, word reordering) can be used to simplify text, copying is by far the most common.",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
We empirically found that 73% of the target words are copied from the source in the Newsela dataset.,3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
This number further increases to 83% when considering Wikipedia-based datasets (we provide details on these datasets in Section 5).,3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"As a result, a generic encoder-decoder model learns to copy all too well at the expense of other rewrite operations, often parroting back the source or making only a few trivial changes.
",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"To encourage a wider variety of rewrite operations while remaining fluent and faithful to the meaning of the source, we employ a reinforcement learning framework (see Figure 1).",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"We view the encoder-decoder model as an agent which first reads the source sentence X; then at each step, it takes an action ŷt ∈ V (where V is the output vocabulary) according to a policy PRL(ŷt|ŷ1:t−1, X) (see Equation (2)).",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"The agent continues to take actions until it produces an End Of Sentence (EOS) token yielding the action sequence Ŷ = (ŷ1, ŷ2, . . .",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
", ŷ|Ŷ |), which is also the simplified output of our model.",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"A reward r is then received and the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992) is used to update the agent.",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"In the following, we first introduce our reward and then present the details of the REINFORCE algorithm.",3 Reinforcement Learning for Sentence Simplification,[0],[0]
"The reward r(Ŷ ) for system output Ŷ is the weighted sum of the three components aimed at capturing key aspects of the target output, namely simplicity, relevance, and fluency:
r(Ŷ ) = λS rS + λR rR + λF",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"rF (7)
where λS , λR, λF ∈",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"[0, 1]; r(Ŷ ) is a shorthand for r(X,Y, Ŷ )",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"whereX is the source, Y the reference (or target), and Ŷ the system output.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"rS , rR, and rF are shorthands for simplicity rS(X,Y, Ŷ ), relevance rR(X, Ŷ ), and fluency rF (Ŷ ).",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"We provide details for each reward summand below.
",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Simplicity To encourage the model to apply a wide range of simplification operations, we use SARI (Xu et al., 2016), a recently proposed metric which compares System output Against References and against the Input sentence.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"SARI is the arithmetic average of n-gram precision and recall of three rewrite operations: addition, copying, and deletion.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
It rewards addition operations where system output was not in the input but occurred in the references.,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Analogously, it rewards words retained/deleted in both the system output and the references.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"In experimental evaluation Xu et al. (2016) demonstrate that SARI correlates well with human judgments of simplicity, whilst correctly rewarding systems that both make changes and simplify the input.
",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
One caveat with using SARI as a reward is the fact that it relies on the availability of multiple references which are rare for sentence simplification.,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Xu et al. (2016) provide eight references for 2,350 sentences, but these are primarily for system tuning and evaluation rather than training.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
The majority of existing simplification datasets (see Section 5 for details) have a single reference for each source sentence.,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Moreover, they are unavoidably noisy as they are mostly constructed automatically, e.g., by aligning sentences from the ordinary and simple English Wikipedias.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"When relying solely on a single reference, SARI will try to reward accidental",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
n-grams that should never have occurred in it.,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"To countenance the effect of noise, we apply SARI(X, Ŷ , Y ) in the expected direction, with X as the source, Ŷ the system output, and Y the reference as well as in the reverse direction with Y as the system output and Ŷ as the reference.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Assuming our system can produce reasonably good simplifications, by swapping the output
and the reference, reverse SARI can be used to estimate how good a reference is with respect to the system output.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Our first reward is therefore the weighted sum of SARI and reverse SARI:
rS=β SARI(X, Ŷ , Y )+(1−β)",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"SARI(X,Y, Ŷ ) (8)
Relevance",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"While the simplicity-based reward rS tries to encourage the model to make changes, the relevance reward rR ensures that the generated sentences preserve the meaning of the source.",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
We use an LSTM sentence encoder to convert the source X and the predicted target Ŷ into two vectors qX and qŶ .,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"The relevance reward rR is simply the cosine similarity between these two vectors:
rR = cos(qX ,qŶ )",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
= qX · qŶ ||qX || ||qŶ,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"||

",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
We use a sequence auto-encoder (SAE; Dai and Le 2015) to train the LSTM sentence encoder on both the complex and simple sentences.,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Specifically, the SAE uses sentence X =",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"(x1, . . .",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
", x|X|) to infer itself via an encoder-decoder model (without an attention mechanism).",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Firstly, an encoder LSTM convertsX into a sequence of hidden states (h1, . . .",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
",h|X|).",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Then, we use h|X| to initialize the hidden state of the decoder LSTM and recover/generate X one word at a time.
",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"Fluency Xu et al. (2016) observe that SARI correlates less with fluency compared to other metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
The fluency reward rF models the well-formedness of the generated sentences explicitly.,3.1 Reward,[0],[0]
"It is the normalized sentence probability assigned by an LSTM
language model trained on simple sentences:
rF = exp  1 |Ŷ | |Ŷ |∑ i=1",3.1 Reward,[0],[0]

"Unfortunately, computing the expectation term is prohibitive, since there is an infinite number of possible action sequences.",3.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm,[0],[0]
"In practice, we approximate this expectation with a single sample from the distribution of PLR(·|X).",3.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm,[0],[0]
We refer to Williams (1992) for the full derivation of the gradients.,3.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm,[0],[0]

To reduce the variance of gradients, we also introduce a baseline linear regression model bt to estimate the expected future reward at time t (Ranzato et al., 2016).",3.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm,[0],[0]
bt takes the concatenation of hTt and ct as input and outputs a real value as the expected reward.,3.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm,[0],[0]
"The parameters of the regressor are
trained by minimizing mean squared error.",3.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm,[0],[0]
"We do not back-propagate this error to hTt or ct during training (Ranzato et al., 2016).",3.2 The REINFORCE Algorithm,[0],[0]
"Presented in its original form, the REINFORCE algorithm starts learning with a random policy.",3.3 Learning,[0],[0]
"This assumption can make model training challenging for generation tasks like ours with large vocabularies (i.e., action spaces).",3.3 Learning,[0],[0]
"We address this issue by pre-training our agent (i.e., the encoderdecoder model) with a negative log-likelihood objective (see Section 2), making sure it can produce reasonable simplifications, thereby starting off with a policy which is better than random.",3.3 Learning,[0],[0]
"We follow prior work (Ranzato et al., 2016) in adopting a curriculum learning strategy.",3.3 Learning,[0],[0]
"In the beginning of training, we give little freedom to our agent allowing it to predict the last few words for each target sentence.",3.3 Learning,[0],[0]
"For every target sequence, we use negative log-likelihood to train the first L (initially, L = 24) tokens and apply the reinforcement learning algorithm to the (L + 1)th tokens onwards.",3.3 Learning,[0],[0]
"Every two epochs, we set L = L− 3 and the training terminates when L is 0.",3.3 Learning,[0],[0]
"Lexical substitution, the replacement of complex words with simpler alternatives, is an integral part of sentence simplification (Specia et al., 2012).",4 Lexical Simplification,[0],[0]
The model presented so far learns lexical substitution and other rewrite operations jointly.,4 Lexical Simplification,[0],[0]
"In some cases, words are predicted because they seem natural in the their context, but are poor substitutes for the content of the complex sentence.",4 Lexical Simplification,[0],[0]
"To countenance this, we learn lexical simplifications explicitly and integrate them with our reinforcement learning-based model.

"The fact that neural models (EncDecA, DRESS and DRESS-LS) fare well on Fluency, is perhaps not surprising given the recent success of LSTMs in language modeling and neural machine translation (Zaremba et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2015).

We further analyzed model performance by computing various statistics on the simplified output.,6 Results,[0],[0]
We measured average sentence length and the degree to which DRESS and comparison systems perform rewriting operations.,6 Results,[0],[0]
"We approximated the latter with Translation Error Rate (TER; Snover et al. 2006), a measure commonly used to automatically evaluate the quality of machine translation output.",6 Results,[0],[0]
We used TER to compute the (average) number of edits required to change an original complex sentence to simpler output.,6 Results,[0],[0]
"We also report the number of edits by type, i.e., the number of insertions, substitutions, deletions, and shifts needed (on average) to convert complex to simple sentences.
",6 Results,[0],[0]
"As shown in Table 4, Hybrid obtains the highest TER, followed by our models (DRESS and
DRESS-LS), which indicates that they actively perform rewriting.",6 Results,[0],[0]
"Perhaps Hybrid is too aggressive when simplifying a sentence, it obtains low Fluency and Adequacy scores in human evaluation (Table 2).",6 Results,[0],[0]
"There is a strong correlation between sentence length and number of deletion operations (i.e., more deleteions lead to shorter sentences) and PBMT-R performs very few deletions.",6 Results,[0],[0]

"DRESS-LS is significantly better on Simplicity than PBMT-R, Hybrid, and the Reference.",6 Results,[0],[0]

"Sentences with gapping (Ross, 1970) such as Paul likes coffee and Mary tea are characterized by having one or more conjuncts that contain multiple arguments or modifiers of an elided predicate.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this example, the predicate likes is elided for the relation Mary likes tea.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While these sentences appear relatively infrequently in most written texts, they are often used to convey a lot of factual information that is highly relevant for language understanding (NLU) tasks such as open information extraction and semantic parsing.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"(1) Unemployment has reached 27.6% in Azerbaijan, 25.7% in Tadzhikistan, 22.8% in Uzbekistan, 18.8% in Turkmenia, 18% in Armenia and 16.3% in Kirgizia, [...]
To extract the information about unemployment rates in the various countries, an NLU system has to identify that the percentages indicate unemployment rates and the locational modifiers indicate the corresponding country.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given only this sentence, or this sentence and a strict surface syntax representation that does not indicate elided predicates, this is a challenging task.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, given a dependency graph that reconstructs the elided predicate for each conjunct, the problem becomes much easier and methods developed to extract information from dependency trees of clauses with canonical structures are much more likely to extract the correct information from a gapped clause.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While gapping constructions receive a lot of attention in the theoretical syntax literature (e.g., Ross 1970; Jackendoff 1971; Steedman 1990; Coppock 2001; Osborne 2006; Johnson 2014; Toosarvandani 2016; Kubota and Levine 2016), they have been almost entirely neglected by the NLP community so far.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The Penn Treebank explicitly annotates gapping constructions, by coindexing arguments in the clause with a predicate and the clause with the gap, but these co-indices are not included in the standard parsing metrics

and almost all parsers ignore them.1",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite the sophisticated analysis of gapping within CCG (Steedman, 1990), sentences with gapping were deemed too difficult to represent within the CCGBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Similarly the treebanks for the Semantic Dependencies Shared Task (Oepen et al., 2015) exclude all sentences from the Wall Street Journal that contain gapping.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, while the tectogrammatical layer of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Bejček et al., 2013) as well as the enhanced Universal Dependencies (UD) representation (Nivre et al., 2016) provide an analysis with reconstructed nodes for gapping constructions, there exist no methods to automatically parse to these representations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here, we provide the first careful analysis of parsing of gapping constructions, and we present two methods for reconstructing elided predicates in sentences with gapping within the UD framework.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As illustrated in Figure 1, we first parse to a dependency tree and then reconstruct the elided material.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The methods differ in how much information is encoded in the dependency tree.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The first method adapts an existing procedure for parsing sentences with elided function words (Seeker et al., 2012), which uses composite labels that can be deterministically turned into dependency graphs in most cases.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The second method is a novel procedure that relies on the parser only to identify a gap, and then employs an unsupervised method to reconstruct the elided predicates and reattach the arguments to the reconstructed predicate.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We find that both methods can reconstruct elided predicates with very high accuracy from gold standard dependency trees.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"When applied to the output of a parser, which often fails to identify gapping, our methods achieve a sentence-level accuracy of 32% and 34%, significantly outperforming the recently proposed constituent parser by Kummerfeld and Klein (2017).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Gapping constructions in English come in many forms that can be broadly classified as follows.
",2.1 Gapping constructions,[0],[0]
"1 To the best of our knowledge, the parser by Kummerfeld and Klein (2017) is the only parser that tries to output the co-indexing of constituents in clauses with gapping but they lack an explicit evaluation of their co-indexing prediction accuracy.

",2.1 Gapping constructions,[0],[0]
The defining characteristic of gapping constructions is that there is a clause that lacks a predicate (the gap) but still contains two or more arguments or modifiers of the elided predicate (the remnants or orphans).,2.1 Gapping constructions,[0],[0]
"In most cases, the remnants have a corresponding argument or modifier (the correspondent) in the clause with the overt predicate.
",2.1 Gapping constructions,[0],[0]
These types of gapping also make up the majority of attested constructions in other languages.,2.1 Gapping constructions,[0],[0]
"However, Wyngaerd (2007) notes that Dutch permits gaps in relative clauses, and Farudi (2013) notes that Farsi permits gaps in finite embedded clauses even if the overt predicate is not embedded.2",2.1 Gapping constructions,[0],[0]
"We work within the UD framework, which aims to provide cross-linguistically consistent dependency annotations that are useful for NLP tasks.",2.2 Target representation,[0],[0]
"UD defines two types of representation: the basic UD representation which is a strict surface syntax dependency tree and the enhanced UD representation (Schuster and Manning, 2016) which may be a graph instead of a tree and may contain additional nodes.",2.2 Target representation,[0],[0]
"The analysis of gapping in the enhanced representation makes use of copy nodes for elided predicates and additional edges for elided arguments, which we both try to automatically reconstruct in this paper.",2.2 Target representation,[0],[0]
"In the simple case in which only one predicate was elided, there is exactly one

The motivation behind this analysis is that the semantically empty markers to are not needed for interpreting the sentence and minimizing the number of copy nodes leads to less complex graphs.
",2.2 Target representation,[0],[0]
"Finally, if a core argument was elided along with the predicate, we introduce additional dependencies between the copy nodes and the shared arguments, as for example, the open clausal complement (xcomp) dependency between the copy node and Senator in the following example.

The rationale for not copying all arguments is again to keep the graph simple, while still encoding all relations between content words.",2.2 Target representation,[0],[0]
"Arguments can be arbitrarily complex and it seems misguided to copy entire subtrees of arguments which, e.g., could contain multiple adverbial clauses.",2.2 Target representation,[0],[0]
Note that linking to existing nodes would not work in the case of verb clusters because they do not satisfy the subtree constraint.,2.2 Target representation,[0],[0]
"Our first method adapts one of the procedures by Seeker et al. (2012), which represents gaps in dependency trees by attaching dependents of an elided predicate with composite relations.",3.1 Composite relations,[0],[0]
"These relations represent the dependency path that would
3To enhance the readability of our examples, we place the copy node in the sentence where the elided predicate would have been pronounced.",3.1 Composite relations,[0],[0]

have existed if nothing had been elided.",3.1 Composite relations,[0],[0]
"For example, in the following sentence, the verb bought, which would have been attached to the head of the first conjunct with a conj relation, was elided from the second conjunct and hence all nodes that would have depended on the elided verb, are attached to the first conjunct using a composite relation consisting of conj and the type of argument.

The major advantage of this approach is that the dependency tree contains information about the types of arguments and so it should be straightforward to turn dependency trees of this form into enhanced UD graphs.",3.1 Composite relations,[0],[0]
"For most dependency trees, one can obtain the enhanced UD graph by splitting the composite relations into its atomic parts and inserting copy nodes at the splitting points.4
At the same time, this approach comes with the drawback of drastically increasing the label space.",3.1 Composite relations,[0],[0]
"For sentences with more complex gaps as in (5), one has to use composite relations that consist of more than two atomic relations and theoretically, the number of composite relations is unbounded:

"Our second method also uses a two-step approach to resolve gaps, but compared to the previous method, it puts less work on the parser.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"We first parse sentences to the basic UD v2 representation, which analyzes gapping constructions as follows.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
One remnant is promoted to be the head of the clause and all other remnants are attached to the promoted phrase.,3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"For example, in this sentence, the subject of the second clause, Mary, is the head of the clause and the other remnant, flowers, is attached to Mary with the special orphan relation:
John bought books and Mary flowers
nsubj",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"obj cc conj orphan
4Note that this representation does not indicate conjunct boundaries, and for sentences with multiple gapped conjuncts, it is thus unclear how many copy nodes are required.

"This analysis can also be used for more complex gaps, as in the example with a gap that consists of a chain of non-finite embedded verbs in (5).
... and Mary a play

orphan
When parsing to this representation, the parser only has to identify that there is a gap but does not have to recover the elided material or determine the type of remnants.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"As a second step, we use an unsupervised procedure to determine which nodes to copy and how and where to attach the remnants.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"In developing this procedure, we made use of the fact that in the vast majority of cases, all arguments and modifiers that are expressed in gapped conjunct are also expressed in the full conjunct.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
The problem of determining which nodes to copy and which relations to use can thus be reduced to the problem of aligning arguments in the gapped conjunct to arguments in the full conjunct.,3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"We apply the following procedure to all sentences that contain at least one orphan relation.
1.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"Create a list F of arguments of the head of the full conjunct by considering all core argument dependents of the conjunct’s head as well as clausal and nominal non-core dependents, and adverbial modifiers.

"Create a list G of arguments in the gapped conjunct that contains the head of the gapped conjunct and all its orphan dependents.
3.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"Find the highest-scoring monotonic alignment of arguments in G to arguments in F .
4.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"Copy the head of the full conjunct and attach the copy node c to the head of the full conjunct with the original relation of the head of the gapped conjunct (usually conj).
5.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"For each argument g ∈ G that has been aligned to f ∈ F , attach g to c with the same relation as the parent relation of f , e.g., if f is attached to the head of the full conjunct with an nsubj relation, also attach g to c with an nsubj relation.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"Attach arguments g′ ∈ G that were not aligned to any token in F to c using the general dep relation.
6.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"For each copy node c, add dependencies to all core arguments of the original node which do not have a corresponding remnant in the gapped clause.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"For example, if the full conjunct contains a subject, an object, and an
oblique modifier but the clause with the gap, only a subject and an oblique modifier, add an object dependency between the copy node and the object in the full conjunct.
",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"A crucial step is the third step, determining the highest-scoring alignment.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"This can be done straightforwardly with the sequence alignment algorithm by Needleman and Wunsch (1970) if one defines a similarity function sim(g, f) that returns a similarity score between the arguments g and f .",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"We defined sim based on the intuitions that often, parallel arguments are of the same syntactic category, that they are introduced by the same function words (e.g., the same preposition), and that they are closely related in meaning.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"The first intuition can be captured by penalizing mismatching POS tags, and the other two by computing the distance between argument embeddings.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
We compute these embeddings by averaging over the 100- dim.,3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"pretrained GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) embeddings for each token in the argument.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"Given the POS tags tg and tf and the argument embeddings vg and vf , sim is defined as follows.5

− vf‖2 + 1,3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"[tg = tf ] × pos_mismatch_penalty
We set pos_mismatch_penalty, a parameter that penalizes mismatching POS tags, to −2.6
This procedure can be used for almost all sentences with gapping constructions.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"However, if parts of an argument were elided along with the main predicate, it can become necessary to copy multiple nodes.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
We therefore consider the alignment not only between complete arguments in the full clause and the gapped clause but also between partial arguments in the full clause and the complete arguments in the gapped clause.,3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"For example, for the sentence “Mary wants to write a play and Sue a book” the complete arguments of the full clause are {Mary, to write a play} and the arguments of the gapped clause are {Sue, a book}.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"In this case, we also consider the partial arguments {Mary, a play} and if the arguments of the gapped
5As suggested by one of the reviewers, we also ran a posthoc experiment with a simpler similarity score function without the embedding distance term, which only takes into account whether the POS tags match.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
"We found that quantitatively, the embeddings do not lead to significant better scores on the test set according to our metrics but qualitatively, they lead to better results for the examples with verb cluster gaps.
6We optimized this parameter on the training set by trying integer values from −1 to −15.

"However, now that the token write is part of the dependency path between want and play, we also have to make a copy of write to reconstruct the UD graph of the gapped clause.",3.2 Orphan procedure,[0],[0]
Both methods rely on a dependency parser followed by a post-processing step.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
We evaluated the individual steps and the end-to-end performance.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]

"For all our metrics, we excluded punctuation tokens.",4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
"To determine sta-
tistical significance of pairwise comparisons, we performed two-tailed approximate randomization tests (Noreen, 1989; Yeh, 2000) with an adapted version of the sigf package (Padó, 2006).
",4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
Results Table 3 shows the overall parsing results on the development and test sets of the two treebanks.,4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
"There was no significant difference between the parser that was trained on the UD representation (ORPHAN) and the parser trained on the composite representation (COMPOSITE) when tested on the EWT data sets, which is not surprising considering that there is just one sentence with gapping each in the development and the test split.",4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
"When evaluated on the GAPPING datasets, the ORPHAN parser performs significantly better (p < 0.01) in terms of labeled attachment score, which suggests that the parser trained on the COMPOSITE representation is indeed struggling with the greatly increased label space.",4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
This is further confirmed by the attachment scores of the head tokens of remnants (Table 4).,4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
The labeled attachment score of remnants is significantly higher for the ORPHAN parser than for the COMPOSITE parser.,4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
"Further, the unlabeled attachment score on the test set is also higher for the ORPHAN parser, which suggests that the COMPOSITE parser is sometimes struggling with finding the right attachment for the
multiple long-distance composite dependencies.",4.2 Parsing experiments,[0],[0]
Our second set of experiments concerns the recovery of the elided material and the reattachment of the orphans.,4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
We conducted two experiments: an oracle experiment that used gold standard dependency trees and an end-to-end experiment that used the output of the parser as input.,4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"For all experiments, we used the COMBINED treebank.
",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"Evaluation Here, we evaluated dependency graphs and therefore used the labeled and unlabeled precision and recall metrics.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"However, as our two procedures are only changing the attachment of orphans, we only computed these metrics for copy nodes and their dependents.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"Further, we excluded punctuation and coordinating conjunctions as their attachment is usually trivial and including them would inflate scores.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we computed the sentence-level accuracy for all sentences with gapping.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"For this metric, we considered a sentence to be correct if all copy nodes and their dependents of a sentence were attached to the correct head with the correct label.
",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
Oracle results The top part of Table 5 shows the results for the oracle experiment.,4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
Both methods are able to reconstruct the elided material and the canonical clause structure from gold dependency trees with high accuracy.,4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"This was expected for the COMPOSITE procedure, which can make use of the composite relations in the dependency trees, but less so for the ORPHAN procedure which has to recover the structure and the types of relations.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"The two methods work equally well in terms of all metrics except for the sentence-level accuracy, which is significantly higher for the COMPOSITE procedure.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
This difference is caused by a difference in the types of mistakes.,4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
All errors of the COMPOSITE procedure are of a structural nature and stem from copying the wrong number of nodes while the dependency labels are always correct because they are part of the dependency tree.,4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"The majority of errors of the ORPHAN procedure stem from incorrect dependency labels, and these mistakes are scattered across more examples, which leads to the lower sentence-level accuracy.
",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
End-to-end results The middle part of Table 5 shows the results for the end-to-end experiment.,4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"The performance of both methods is considerably lower than in the oracle experiment, which is pri-
marily driven by the much lower recall.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"Both methods assume that the parser detects the existence of a gap and if the parser fails to do so, neither method attempts to reconstruct the elided material.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"In general, precision tends to be a bit higher for the ORPHAN procedure whereas recall tends to be a bit higher for the COMPOSITE method but overall and in terms of sentence-level accuracy both methods seem to perform equally well.
",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"Error analysis For both methods, the primary issue is low recall, which is a result of parsing errors.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"When the parser correctly predicts the orphan relation, the main sources of error for the ORPHAN procedure are missing correspondents for remnants (e.g., [for good] has no correspondent in They had left the company, many for good) or that the types of argument of the remnant and its correspondent differ (e.g., in She was convicted of selling unregistered securities in Florida and of unlawful phone calls in Ohio,",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"[of selling unregistered securities] is an adverbial clause whereas [of unlawful phone calls] is an oblique modifier).
",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
"Apart from the cases where the COMPOSITE procedure leads to an incorrect structure, the remaining errors are all caused by the parser predicting the wrong composite relation.",4.3 Recovery experiments,[0],[0]
Kummerfeld and Klein (henceforth K&K; 2017) recently proposed a one-endpoint-crossing graph parser that is able to directly parse to PTB-style trees with traces.,4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
They also briefly discuss gapping constructions and their parser tries to output the co-indexing that is used for gapping constructions in the PTB.,4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"The EWT and all the sentences that we took from the WSJ, Brown, and GENIA treebanks already come with constituency tree annotations, and we manually annotated the remaining sentences according to the PTB guide-
lines (Bies et al., 1995).",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
This allowed us to train the K&K parser with exactly the same set of sentences that we used in our previous experiments.,4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"As this parser outputs constituency trees, we could not compute dependency graph metrics for this method.",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"For the sentence-level accuracy, we considered an example to be correct if a) each argument in the gapped conjunct was the child of a single constituent node, which in return was the sibling of the full clause/verb phrase, and b) the coindexing of each argument in the gapped conjunct was correct.",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"For example, the following bracketing would be considered correct despite the incorrect internal structure of the first conjunct: [S[S[NP-1 Al ] likes [NP-2 coffee ]] and [S[NP=1 Sue",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
],4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"[NP=2 tea ]]]
The last row of Table 5 shows the results of the K&K parser.",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
The parser failed to output the correct constituency structure or co-indexing for every single example in the development and test sets.,4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"The parser struggled in particular with outputting the correct co-indices: For 32.5% of the test sentences with gapping, the bracketing of the gapped clause was correct but one or more of the co-indices were missing from the output.
",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"Overall these results suggest that our dependency-based approach is much more reliable at identifying gapping constructions than the parser by K&K, which, in their defense, was optimized to output traces for other phenomena.",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
"Our method is also faster and took only seconds to parse the test set, while the K&K parser took several hours.",4.4 Comparison to Kummerfeld and Klein,[0],[0]
One of the appeals of the ORPHAN procedure is that it can be easily applied to other languages even if there exist no annotated enhanced dependency graphs.8,5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"On the one hand, this is because
8There is no theoretical reason that would prevent one from using the COMPOSITE procedure for other languages
our method does not make use of lexical information, and on the other hand, this is because we developed our method on top of the UD annotation scheme, which has already been applied to many languages and for which many treebanks exist.
",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"Currently, all treebanks but the English one lack copy nodes for gapping constructions and many of them incorrectly use the orphan relation (Droganova and Zeman, 2017) and therefore we could not evaluate our method on a large variety of languages.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"In order to demonstrate that our method can be applied to other languages, we therefore did a case study on the Swedish UD treebank.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"The Swedish UD treebank is an automatic conversion from a section of the Talbanken (Einarsson, 1976) with extensive manual corrections.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"While the treebank is overall of high quality, we noticed conversion errors that led to incorrect uses of the orphan relation in 11 of the 29 sentences with orphan relations, which we excluded from our evaluation.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
We applied our gapping resolution procedure without any modifications to the remaining 18 sentences.,5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
We used the Swedish word2vec embeddings that were prepared for the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task.,5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"Our method correctly predicts the insertion of 29 copy nodes and is able to predict the correct structure of the enhanced representation in all cases, including complex ones with elided verb clusters such as the example in Figure 2.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"It also predicts the correct dependency label for 108/110 relations, leading to a labeled precision and labeled recall of 98.18%, which are both higher than the English numbers despite the fact that we optimized our procedure for English.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"The main reason for the higher performance seems to be that many of the Swedish examples come from informational texts from public organizations, which are more likely to be written to be clear and unambiguous.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"Further, the Swedish data does not contain challenging examples from the linguistic literature.
",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"As Swedish is a Germanic language like English and thus shares many structural properties, we cannot conclude that our method is applicable to any language based on just this experiment.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"However, given that our method does not rely on language-specific structural patterns, we expect it to work well for a wide range of languages.
",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"but given that UD treebanks are annotated with orphan relations, using the the COMPOSITE procedure would require additional manual annotations in practice.",5 Resolving gaps in other languages,[0],[0]
"Gapping constructions have been little studied in NLP, but several approaches (e.g., Dukes and Habash 2011; Simkó and Vincze 2017) parse to dependency trees with empty nodes.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"Seeker et al. (2012) compared three ways of parsing with empty heads: adding a transition that inserts empty nodes, using composite relation labels for nodes that depend on an elided node, and pre-inserting empties before parsing.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
These papers all focus on recovering nodes for elided function words such as auxiliaries; none of them attempt to recover and resolve the content word elisions of gapping.,6 Related work,[0],[0]
"Ficler and Goldberg (2016) modified PTB annotations of argument-cluster coordinations (ACCs), i.e., gapping constructions with two post-verbal orphan phrases, which make up a subset of the gapping constructions in the PTB.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"While the modified annotation style leads to higher parsing accuracy of ACCs, it is specific to ACCs and does not generalize to other gapping constructions.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, they did not reconstruct gapped ACC clauses.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"Traditional grammarbased chart parsers (Kay, 1980; Klein and Manning, 2001) did handle empty nodes and so could in principle provide a parse of gapping sentences though additional mechanisms would be needed for reconstruction.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"In practice, though, dealing with gapping in a grammar-based framework is not straightforward and can lead to a combinatorial explosion that slows down parsing in general, as has been noted for the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2017, p.c.) and for an HPSG implementation for Norwegian (Haugereid, 2017).",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"The grammar-based parser built with augmented transition networks (Woods, 1970) provided an extension in the form of the SYSCONJ operation (Woods, 1973) to parse some gapping constructions, but also this approach lacked explicit reconstruction mechanisms and provided only limited coverage.
",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"There also exists a long line of work on postprocessing surface-syntax constituency trees to recover traces in the PTB (Johnson, 2002; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004; Gabbard et al., 2006), pre-processing sentences such that they contain tokens for traces before parsing (Dienes and Dubey, 2003b), or directly parsing sentences to either PTB-style trees with empty elements or pre-processed trees that can be deterministically converted to PTB-style trees (Collins,
1997; Dienes and Dubey, 2003a; Schmid, 2006; Cai et al., 2011; Hayashi and Nagata, 2016; Kato and Matsubara, 2016; Kummerfeld and Klein, 2017).",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"However, all of these works are primarily concerned with recovering traces for phenomena such as Wh-movement or control and raising constructions and, with the exception of Kummerfeld and Klein (2017), none of these works attempt to output the co-indexing that is used for analyzing gapping constructions.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"And again, none of these works try to reconstruct elided material.
",6 Related work,[0],[0]
"Lastly, several methods have been proposed for resolving other forms of ellipsis, including VP ellipsis (Hardt, 1997; Nielsen, 2004; Lappin, 2005; McShane and Babkin, 2016) and sluicing (Anand and Hardt, 2016) but none of these methods consider gapping constructions.",6 Related work,[0],[0]
We presented two methods to recover elided predicates in sentences with gapping.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Our experiments suggest that both methods work equally well in a realistic end-to-end setting.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"While in general, recall is still low, the oracle experiments suggest that both methods can recover elided predicates from correct dependency trees, which suggests that as parsers become more and more accurate, the gap recovery accuracy should also increase.
",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
We also demonstrated that our method can be used to automatically add the enhanced UD representation to UD treebanks in other languages than English.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Apart from being useful in a parsing pipeline, we therefore also expect our method to be useful for building enhanced UD treebanks.

Sentences with Gapping: Parsing and Reconstructing Elided Predicates,title,[0],[0]
"Sentiment-oriented relation extraction (Choi et al., 2006) is concerned with recognizing sentiment polarities and comparative relations between entities from natural language text.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Identifying such relations often requires syntactic and semantic analysis at both sentence and phrase level.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most prior work on sentiment analysis consider either i) subjective sentence detection (Yu and Kübler, 2011), ii) polarity classification (Johansson and Moschitti, 2011; Wilson et al., 2005), or iii) comparative relation identification (Jindal and Liu, 2006; Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In practice, however, differ-
ent types of sentiment-oriented relations frequently coexist in documents.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In particular, we found that more than 38% of the sentences in our test corpus contain more than one type of relations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The isolated analysis approach is inappropriate because i) it sacrifices acuracy by ignoring the intricate interplay among different types of relations; ii) it could lead to conflicting predictions such as estimating a relation candidate as both negative and comparative.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, in this paper, we identify instances of both sentiment polarities and comparative relations for entities of interest simultaneously.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We assume that all the mentions of entities and attributes are given, and entities are disambiguated.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It is a widely used assumption when evaluating a module in a pipeline system that the outputs of preceding modules are error-free.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, the only existing system capable of extracting both comparisons and sentiment polarities is a rule-based system proposed by Ding et al. (2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We argue that it is better to tackle the task by using a unified model with structured outputs.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It allows us to consider a set of correlated relation instances jointly and characterize their interaction through a set of soft and hard constraints.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, we can encode constraints to discourage an attribute to participate in a polarity relation and a comparative relation at the same time.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, the system extracts a set of correlated instances of sentiment-oriented relations from a given sentence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, with the sentence about the camera Canon 7D, “The sensor is great, but the price is higher than Nikon D7000.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"However, constructing a fully annotated training corpus for this task is labor-intensive and requires strong linguistic background.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We minimize this overhead by applying a simplified annotation scheme, in which annotators mark mentions of entities and attributes, disambiguate the entities, and label instances of relations for each sentence.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Based on the new scheme, we have created a small Sentiment Relation Graph (SRG) corpus for the domains of cameras and movies, which significantly differs from the corpora used in prior work (Wei and Gulla, 2010; Kessler et al., 2010; Toprak et al., 2010; Wiebe et al., 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004) in the following ways: i) both sentiment polarities and comparative relations are annotated; ii) all mentioned entities are disambiguated; and iii) no subjective expressions are annotated, unless they are part of entity mentions.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The new annotation scheme raises a new challenge for learning algorithms in that they need to automatically find textual evidences for each annotated relation during training.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, with the sentence “I like the Rebel a little better, but that is another price jump”, simply assigning a sentimentbearing expression to the nearest relation candidate is insufficient, especially when the sentiment is not explicitly expressed.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose SENTI-LSSVM, a latent structural SVM based model for sentiment-oriented relation extraction.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"SENTI-LSSVM is applied to find the most likely set of the relation instances expressed in a given sentence, where the latent variables are used to assign the most appropriate textual evidences to the respective instances.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In summary, the contributions of this paper are the following:
• We propose SENTI-LSSVM: the first unified statistical model with the capability of extracting instances of both binary and ternary sentimentoriented relations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We design a task-specific integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for inference.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We construct a new SRG corpus as a valuable asset for the evaluation of sentiment relation
extraction.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"• We conduct extensive experiments with online reviews and forum posts, showing that SENTI-LSSVM model can effectively learn from a training corpus without explicitly annotated subjective expressions and that its performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There are ample works on analyzing sentiment polarities and entity comparisons, but the majority of them studied the two tasks in isolation.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Most prior approaches for fine-grained sentiment analysis focus on polarity classification.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Supervised approaches on expression-level analysis require the annotation of sentiment-bearing expressions as training data (Jin et al., 2009; Choi and Cardie, 2010; Johansson and Moschitti, 2011; Yessenalina and Cardie, 2011; Wei and Gulla, 2010).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, the corresponding annotation process is time-consuming.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Although sentence-level annotations are easier to obtain, the analysis at this level cannot cope with sentences conveying relations of multiple types (McDonald et al., 2007; Täckström and McDonald, 2011; Socher et al., 2012).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Lexiconbased approaches require no training data (Ku et al., 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Godbole et al., 2007; Ding et al., 2008; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Liu et al., 2005) but suffer from inferior performance (Wilson et al., 2005; Qu et al., 2012).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, our method requires no annotation of sentiment-bearing expressions for training and can predict both sentiment polarities and comparative relations.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Sentiment-oriented comparative relations have been studied in the context of user-generated discourse (Jindal and Liu, 2006; Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Approaches rely on linguistically motivated rules and assume the existence of independent keywords in sentences which indicate comparative relations.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Therefore, these methods fall short of extracting comparative relations based on domain dependent information.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Both Johansson and Moschitti (2011) and Wu et al. (2011) formulate fine-grained sentiment analysis as a learning problem with structured outputs.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, they focus only on polarity classification
of expressions and require annotation of sentimentbearing expressions for training as well.
While ILP has been previously applied for inference in sentiment analysis (Choi and Cardie, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Wu et al., 2011), our task requires a complete ILP reformulation due to 1) the absence of annotated sentiment expressions and 2) the constraints imposed by the joint extraction of both sentiment polarity and comparative relations.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
This section gives an overview of the whole system for extracting sentiment-oriented relation instances.,3 System Overview,[0],[0]
"Prior to presenting the system architecture, we introduce the essential concepts and the definitions of two kinds of directed hypergraphs as the representation of correlated relation instances extracted from sentences.",3 System Overview,[0],[0]
Entity.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"An entity is an abstract or concrete thing, which needs not be of material existence.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
An entity in this paper refers to either a product or a brand.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
Attribute.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"An attribute is an object closely associated with or belonging to an entity, such as the lens of digital camera.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
Sentiment-Oriented Relation.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"A sentimentoriented relation is either a sentiment polarity or a comparative relation, defined on tuples of entities and attributes.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"A sentiment polarity relation conveys either a positive or a negative attitude towards entities or their attributes, whereas a comparative relation indicates the preference of one entity over the other entity w.r.t.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
an attribute.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
Relation Instance.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"An instance of sentiment polarity takes the form r(entity, attribute) with r ∈ {positive, negative}, such as positive(Canon 7D, sensor).",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"The polarity instances expressed in the form of unary relations, such as “Nikon D7000 is excellent.”, are denoted as binary relations r(entity, whole), where the attribute whole indicates the entity as a whole.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"In contrast, an instance of comparative relation is in the form of preferred{entity, entity, attribute}, e.g. preferred(Canon 7D, Nikon D7000, price).",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"For brevity, we refer to an instance set of sentiment-oriented relations extracted from a
sentence as an sSoR. To represent the instances of the remaining relations, we represent them as other{entity, attribute}, such as textitpartOf{wheel, car}.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
These relations include objective relations and the subjective relations other than sentimentoriented relations.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
Mention-Based Relation Instances.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
A mentionbased relation instance refers to a tuple of entity mentions with a certain relation.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"This concept is introduced as the representation of instances in a sentence by replacing entities with the corresponding entity mentions, such as positive(“Canon SD880i”, “wide angle view”).
",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
Mention-Based Relation Graph.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
A mention-based relation graph (or MRG ) represents a collection of mention-based relation instances expressed in a sentence.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"As illustrated in Figure 1, an MRG is a directed hypergraph G = 〈M,E〉 with a vertex set M and an edge set E. A vertex mi ∈ M denotes a mention of an entity or an attribute occurring either within the sentence or in its context.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
We say that a mention is from the context if it is mentioned in the previous sentence or is an attribute implied in the current sentence.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"An instance of a binary relation in an MRG takes the form of a binary edge el = (mi,ma), where mi and ma denote an entity mention and an attribute mention respectively, and the type l ∈ {positive, negative, other}.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"A ternary edge el indicating comparative relation is represented as el = (mi,mj ,ma), where two entity mentions mi and mj are compared with respect to the attribute mention ma.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"We define the type l ∈ {better,worse} to indicate two possible directions of the relation and assume mi occurs before mj .",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"As a result, we have a set L of five relation types: positive, negative, better, worse or other.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"According to these definitions, the annotations in the SRG corpus are actually MRGs and disambiguated entities.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"If there are multiple mentions referring to the same entity, annotators are asked to choose the
most obvious one because it saves annotation time and is less demanding for the entity recognition and diambiguation modules.
",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
Evidentiary Mention-Based Relation Graph.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"An evidentiary mention-based relation graph, coined eMRG , extends an MRG by associating each edge with a textual evidence to support the corresponding relation assertions (see Figure 2).",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"Consequently, an edge in an eMRG is denoted by a pair (a, c), where a represents a mention-based relation instance and c is the associated textual evidence.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
It is also referred to as an evidentiary edge.,3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"represented as el = (mi,mj ,ma), an MRG as an evidentiary MRG (eMRG) and the edges of eMRGs as evidentiary edges, as shown in Figure 2.",3.1 Concepts and Definitions,[0],[0]
"As illustrated by Figure 3, at the core of our system is the SENTI-LSSVM model, which extracts sets
of mention-based relationships in the form of eMRGs from sentences.",3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
"For a given sentence with known entity mentions, we select all possible mention sets as relation candidates, where each set includes at least one entity mention.",3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
Then we associate each relation candidate with a set of constituents or the whole sentence as the textual evidence candidates (cf. Section 6.1).,3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
"Subsequently, the inference component aims to find the most likely eMRG from all possible combinations of mention-based relation instances and their textual evidences (cf. Section 6.2).",3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
The representation eMRG is chosen because it characterizes exactly the model outputs by letting each edge correspond to an instance of mention-based relation and the associated textual evidence.,3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
"Finally, the model parameters of this model are learned by an online algorithm (cf. Section 7).
",3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
"Since instance sets of sentiment-oriented relations (sSoRs) are the expected outputs, we can obtain sSoRs from MRGs by using a simple rule-based algorithm.",3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
The algorithm essentially maps the mentions from an MRG into entities and attributes in an sSoR and label the corresponding tuples with the relation types of the edges from an MRG.,3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
"For instances of comparative relation, the label better or worse is mapped to the relation type preferred.",3.2 System Architecture,[0],[0]
The task of sentiment-oriented relation extraction is to determine the most likely sSoR in a sentence.,4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"Since sSoRs are derived from the corresponding MRGs as described in Section 3, the task is reduced to find the most likely MRG for each sentence.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"Since an MRG is created by assigning relation types to a subset of all relation candidates, which are possible tuples of mentions with unknown relation types, the number of MRGs can be extremely high.
",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"To tackle the task, one solution is to employ an edge-factored linear model in the framework of structural SVM (Martins et al., 2009; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"The model suggests that a bag of features should be specified for each relation candidate, and then the model predicts the most likely candidate sets along with their relation types to form the optimal MRGs.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"As we observed, for a relation candidate, the most informative features are the words near its entity mentions in the original text.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"How-
ever, if we represent a candidate by all these words, it is very likely that the instances of different relation types share overly similar features, because a mention is often involved in more than one relation candidate, as shown in Figure 2.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"As a consequence, the instances of different relations represented by overly similar features can easily confuse the learning algorithm.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"Thus, it is critical to select proper constituents or sentences as textual evidences for each relation candidate in both training and testing.
",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"Consequently, we divide the task of sentimentoriented relation extraction into two subtasks : i) identifying the most likely MRGs; ii) assigning proper textual evidences to each edge of MRGs to support their relation assertions.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
It is desirable to carry out the two subtasks jointly as these two subtasks could enhance each other.,4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"First, the identification of relation types requires proper textual evidences; second, the soft and hard constraints imposed by the correlated relation instances facilitate the recognition of the corresponding textual evidences.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"Since the eMRGs are created by attaching every MRG with a set of textual evidences, tackling the two subtasks simultaneously is equivalent to selecting the most likely eMRG from a set of eMRG candidates.",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"It is challenging because our SRG corpus does not contain any annotation of textual evidences.

"Formally, let X denote the set of all available sentences, and we define y ∈ Y(x)(x ∈ X ) as the set of labeled edges of an MRG and Y = ∪x∈XY(x).",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]
"Since the assignments of textual evidences are not observed, an assignment of evidences to y is denoted by a latent variable h ∈ H(x) and H = ∪x∈XH(x).",4 SENTI-LSSVM Model,[0],[0]

"The output of the first predictor is an integer value, while the output of the second predictor is a sentiment relation, such as “positive”,
“negative”, “better” or “worse”.",5 Feature Space,[0],[0]

Others: The commonly used part-of-speech tags are also included as features.,5 Feature Space,[0],[0]
"Moreover, for an edge candidate, a set of binary features are used to denote the types of the edge and its entity mentions.",5 Feature Space,[0],[0]
"For instance, a binary feature indicates whether an edge is a binary edge related to an entity mentioned in context.",5 Feature Space,[0],[0]
"To characterize the syntactic dependencies between two adjacent entity mentions, we use the path in the dependency tree between the heads of the corresponding constituents, the number of words and other mentions in-between as features.",5 Feature Space,[0],[0]

This section describes the empirical evaluation of SENTI-LSSVM together with two competitive baselines on the SRG corpus.,9 Experiments,[0],[0]
"We implemented a rule-based baseline (DINGRULE) and a structural SVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) baseline (SENTI-SSVM) for comparison.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The former system extends the work of Ding et al. (2009), which designed several linguisticallymotivated rules based on a sentiment polarity lexicon for relation identification and assumes there is only one type of sentiment relation in a sentence.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"In our implementation, we keep all the rules of (Ding et al., 2009) and add one phrase-level rule when there are more than one mention in a sentence.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The additional rule assigns sentiment-bearing words and negators to its nearest relation candidates based on the absolute surface distance between the words and the corresponding mentions.,9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"In this case, the phraselevel sentiment-oriented relations depend only on the assigned sentiment words and negators.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The latter system is based on a structural SVM and does not consider the assignment of textual evidences to relation instances during inference.,9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"The textual features of a relation candidate are all lexical and sentiment predictor features within a surface distance of four words from the mentions of the candidate.
",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Thus, this baseline does not need the inference constraints of SENTI-LSSVM for the selection of textual evidences.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"To gain more insights into the model, we also evaluate the contribution of individual features of SENTI-LSSVM.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"In addition, to show if identifying sentiment polarities and comparative relations jointly works better than tackling each task on its own, we train SENTI-LSSVM for each task separately and combine their predictions according to compatibility rules and the corresponding graph scores.

"For each domain and text genre, we withheld 15% documents for development and use the remaining for cross validation.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
The hyperparameters of all systems are tuned on the development datasets.,9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"For all experiments of SENTI-LSSVM, we use ρ = 0.0001 for the L1 regularizer in Eq.(4) and ϕ = 0.05 for the loss function; and for SENTI-SSVM, ρ = 0.0001 and ϕ = 0.01.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Since the relation type of off-topic sentences is certainly other, we evaluate all systems with 5-fold cross-validation only on the on-topic sentences in the evaluation dataset.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Since the same sSoR can have several equivalent MRGs and the relation type other is not of our interest, we evaluate the sSoRs in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.",9.1 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]

Here our model SENTI-LSSVM outperformed all baselines in terms of the average F-measure scores and recalls by a large margin.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]

The rule-based system has higher precision than recall in most cases.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"However, simply increasing the coverage of the domain independent sentiment polarity lexicon might lead to worse performance (Taboada et al., 2011) because many sentiment oriented relations are conveyed by domain dependent expressions and factual expressions implying evaluations, such as “This camera does not have manual control.”",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Compared to DING-RULE, SENTI-SSVM performs better in the camera domain but worse for the movies due to many misclassification of negative relation instances as other.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
It also wrongly predicted more positive instances as other than SENTI-LSSVM.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"We found that the recalls of these instances are low because they often have overly similar features with the instances of the type
other linking to the same mentions.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
The problem gets worse in the movie domain since i),9.2 Results,[0],[0]
many sentences contain no explicit sentiment-bearing words; ii) the prior polarity of the sentiment-bearing words do not agree with their contextual polarity in the sentences.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
Consider the following example from a forum post about the movie “Superman Returns”: “Have a look at Superman: the Animated Series or Justice League Unlimited . . .,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
that is how the characters of Superman and Lex Luthor should be.”.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"In contrast, our model minimizes the overlapping features by assigning them to the most likely relation candidates.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
This leads to significantly better performance.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Although SENTI-SSVM has low recall for both positive and negative relations, it achieves the highest recall for the comparative relation among all systems in the movie domain and camera reviews.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"Since less than 1% of all instances are for comparative relations in these document sets and all models are trained to optimize the overall accuracy, SENTILSSVM intends to trade off the minority class for the overall better performance.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"This advantage disappears on the camera forum posts, where the number of instances of comparative relation is 12 times more than that in the other data sets.
",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
All systems perform better in predicting positive relations than the negative ones.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"This corresponds well to the empirical findings in (Wilson, 2008) that people intend to use more complex expressions for negative sentiments than their affirmative counterparts.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
It is also in accordance with the distribution of these relations in our SRG corpus which is randomly sampled from the online documents.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"For learning systems, it can also be explained by the fact that the training data for positive relations are considerably more than those for negative ones.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]

"As shown in Table 3, the features from the sentiment predictors make significant contributions for both datasets.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"The different drops of the performance indicate that the po-
larities predicted by rules are more consistent in camera forum posts than in movie reviews.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
Due to the complexity of expressions in the movie reviews our model cannot benefit from the unigram features but these features are a good compensation for the sentiment predictor features in camera forum posts.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
The sharp drop by removing the context features from our model on movie reviews indicates that the sentiments in movie reviews depend highly on the relations of the previous sentences.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"In contrast, the sentiment-oriented relations of the previous sentences could be a reason of overfitting for camera forum data.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]
The edge co-occurrence features do not play an important role in our model since the number of co-occurred sentiment-oriented relations in the sentences with contrast conjunctions like “but” is small.,9.2 Results,[0],[0]
"However, we found that allowing the co-occurrence of any sentiment-oriented relations would harm the performance of the model.

arated approach, which trains a model for sentiment polarities and comparative relations respectively, leads to a decrease by almost 1% in terms of the F-measure averaged over all four datasets.",9.2 Results,[0],[0]

"Sentiment analysis, a.k.a. opinion mining, is a task which aims to identify the user sentiment orientation of a product/brand/service by monitoring the online textual data, e.g., reviews and social media messages.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It has attracted huge attention in both academic and industrial communities due to its widespread applications, such like recommendation (Zhang et al., 2014) and social media mining (Chambers et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As the fundamental component in sentiment analysis, sentiment classification mainly classifies the sentiment polarity as positive or negative, and has been well-studied from both sentence-level (Kim and Hovy, 2004) and document-level (Xu et al., 2016).

Recently, a new QA-style reviewing form, namely “customer questions & answers”, has become increasingly popular on the giant ecommerce platforms, e.g., Amazon and Taobao.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this new form, a potential customer asks question(s) about the target product/service while other experienced user(s) can provide answer(s).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"With the widespread of such QA-style reviews, users find a different channel to efficiently explore rich and useful information, and service providers and scholars are paying more attention to its specific characteristics comparing with traditional reviews (Wachsmuth et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2015a).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Comparing to the traditional reviews, the QA style reviews can be more informative and convincing.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More importantly, because answer providers are randomly picked from the users who already purchased the target item, this new form of review can be more reliable and trustful.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Regarding QA-style sentiment analysis, one straightforward method is to directly employ an existing sentiment classification approach that works well on traditional reviews, such as RNN (Nguyen and Shirai, 2015) and LSTM (Chen et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, because of the significant differences between QA-style and classical reviews, existing review mining algorithms, e.g., text-based sentiment analysis/classification, should not be di-
rectly applied to this new kind of QA-style data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More detailed reasons can be found as the followings.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, in QA-style text, the question and answer text are more likely to be two parallel units rather than a sequence form.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the one hand, for instance, in Figure 1, sentence “It’s a nice phone with high-quality screen.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
in Answer 1 actually does not follow sentence “How is the battery?”,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"in Question 1 , but corresponds to sentence “Is the screen clear?”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
in Question 1.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, when the question text and answer text are presented as two units in a sequence, it is rather difficult to capture the relationship between the question and its corresponding answer due to the possible long distance between them.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, there often exists both positive and negative sentiments in answer text according to different parts of question, and this specific case should be categorized as another category named conflict.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, in Figure 1, Answer 1",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
“It’s a nice phone with high-quality screen.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
But the battery is not durable.”,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
is a conflict answer to Question 1.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, when this answer text is considered as a sequence, it is highly possible to be predicted as the category of positive or negative rather than conflict.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In order to address these problems, a more appropriate approach is to segment both the question and answer text into some parallel sentences, and then construct the [Q-sentence, A-sentence] units in each QA text pair to detect in-depth sentiment information.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, although the main sentiment polarity is usually expressed from the answer text, the question text could also carry important sentiment tips to predict the sentiment polarity of a QA text pair.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, in Figure 1, we could hardly estimate the sentiment polarity solely based on Answer 2.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, when we take Question 2, “Is the sun cream really effective?”, into consideration, it can be easier to label this QA text pair with a negative tag.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this study, we propose an approach to match the sentences inside the question and answer text bidirectionally.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third, in each QA text pair, the importance degrees of different [Q-sentence, A-sentence] units can be different.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, in Figure 1, the [Qsentence, A-sentence] unit, i.e., sentence “Summer is coming, I’m afraid of getting darker.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"in Answer 2 and sentence “No, just depending on my own experience.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"in Question 2, makes tiny contribution to imply the sentiment polarity for the
QA text pair.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, a well-behaved network approach should consider the importance degrees of different [Q-sentence, A-sentence] units for predicting the sentiment polarity of a QA text pair.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The contribution of this paper is twofold.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, we propose a novel problem, QA-style sentiment analysis, and build a large-scale annotated corpus tailed for this task.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The dataset is released to motivate future investigations for this track of research.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, we propose a hierarchical matching network model to address the challenges of QA-style sentiment classification.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we first segment both the question and answer text into sentences and construct the [Q-sentence, A-sentence] units for each QA text pair.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Then, by using a QA bidirectional matching layer, we encode each [Q-sentence, A-sentence] unit for exploring sentiment information.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, the self-matching attention layer in the model can capture the importance of these [Q-sentence, A-sentence] matching vectors obtained from QA bidirectional matching layer, which could effectively refine the evidence for inferring the sentiment polarity of a QA text pair.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several strong baselines for QA-style sentiment classification.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Sentiment classification has become a hot research field in NLP since the pioneering work by Pang et al. (2002).,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In general, the research on traditional sentiment classification has been carried out in different text levels, such like word-level, documentlevel and aspect-level.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Word-level sentiment classification has been studied in a long period in the research community of sentiment analysis.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Some early studies have devoted their efforts to predicting the sentiment polarity of a word with different learning models and resources.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Turney (2002) proposed an approach to predicting the sentiment polarity of words by calculating Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) values between the seed words and the search hits.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Hassan and Radev (2010) and Hassan et al. (2011) applied a Markov random walk model to determine the word polarities with a large word relatedness graph, and the synonyms and hypernyms in WordNet (Miller, 1995).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More recently, some studies aim to learn better word embedding of a word rather than its polarity.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Tang et al. (2014) developed three neural networks to learn word em-
bedding by incorporating sentiment polarities of text in loss functions.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Zhou et al. (2015b) employed both unsupervised and supervised neural networks to learn bilingual sentiment word embedding.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Document-level sentiment classification has also been studied in a long period in the research community of sentiment analysis.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"On one hand, many early studies have been devoted their efforts to various of aspects on learning approaches, such as supervised learning (Pang et al., 2002; Riloff et al., 2006), semi-supervised learning (Li et al., 2010; Xia et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015), and domain adaptation (Blitzer et al., 2007; He et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, many recent studies employ deep learning approaches to enhance the performances in sentiment classification.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Tang et al. (2015) proposed a user-product neural network to incorporate both user and product information for sentiment classification.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Xu et al. (2016) proposed a Cached Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (CLSTM) to capture the overall semantic information in long texts.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More recently, Long et al. (2017) proposed a novel attention model, namely cognition-based attention, for sentiment classification.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Aspect-level sentiment classification is a relatively new research area in the research community of sentiment analysis and it is a fine-grained classification task.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Recently, Wang et al. (2016) proposed an attention-based LSTM neural network to aspect-level sentiment classification by exploring the connection between an aspect and the content of a sentence.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Tang et al. (2016) proposed a deep memory network with multiple attention-based computational layers to improve the performance.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wang et al. (2018) proposed a hierarchical attention network to explore both word-level and clause-level sentiment information towards a target aspect.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Unlike all the prior studies, this paper focuses on a very different kind of text representation, i.e., QA-style text level, for sentiment classification.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to perform sentiment classification on this text level.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We collect QA text pairs from “Asking All” in Taobao (Alibaba)1, which is the world’s biggest ecommerce company.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"The QA text pairs are mainly from Beauty, Shoe and Electronic domains and each domain contains 10,000 QA text pairs.
",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"We define four sentiment-related categories, i.e., positive, negative, conflict (both positive and negative sentiment) and neutral (neither positive nor negative sentiment).",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"To guarantee a high annotation agreement, we propose some annotation guidelines after several times of annotation processes on a small size of data.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Then, we ask more coders to annotate the whole data set according to these annotation guidelines.
",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
The annotation guidelines contain two main groups.,3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]
"One contains the guidelines which aim to distinguish the categories of neutral and nonneutral, i.e., (a) A QA text pair in which the question and the answer do not match is annotated as a neutral sample.",3 Data Collection and Annotation,[0],[0]

NLP research relies heavily on annotated datasets for training and evaluation.,1 Introduction,[1.0],['NLP research relies heavily on annotated datasets for training and evaluation.']
"The design of the annotation task can influence the decisions made by annotators in subtle ways: besides the actual features of the instance being annotated, annotators are also influenced by factors such as the user interface, wording of the question, and familiarity with the task or domain.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"When collecting NLP annotations, care is usually taken to ensure that the annotations are of high quality, through careful design of label sets, annotation guidelines and training of annotators (Hovy et al., 2006), methods for aggregating annotations (Passonneau and Carpenter, 2014), and intuitive user interfaces (Stenetorp et al., 2012).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Crowdsourcing has emerged as a cheaper, faster alternative to expert NLP annotations (Snow et al.,
2008; Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010; Graham et al., 2017), although it entails additional effort to filter out unskilled or opportunistic workers, e.g. through the collection of redundant repeated judgements for each instance, or including some trap questions with known answers (CallisonBurch and Dredze, 2010; Hoßfeld et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In most annotation exercises, the order of presentation of instances is randomised to remove bias due to similarities in topic, style and vocabulary (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Bojar et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"When crowdsourcing judgements, the normal practise (as used in the datasets we analyse) is for the item ordering to be randomised in creating a “HIT” (i.e. a single collection of items presented to a crowdworker for judgement), and then to have each HIT annotated by multiple workers, for quality control purposes.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The order of items is generally fixed across all annotators of an individual HIT (Snow et al., 2008; Graham et al., 2017).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we show that worker scores are affected by sequence bias, whereby the order of presentation can affect individuals’ assessment of an item.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since all workers see the instances in the same order, this affects any other inferences made from the data, including aggregated assessment or inferences about individual annotators (such as their overall quality or individual thresholds).

"In particular, in binary annotation tasks, if they expect that True (1) and False (0) items are equally likely, then they believe the sequence 00000 (100% False and 0% True) is less likely than the sequence 01010 (50% False and 50% True).",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['In particular, in binary annotation tasks, if they expect that True (1) and False (0) items are equally likely, then they believe the sequence 00000 (100% False and 0% True) is less likely than the sequence 01010 (50% False and 50% True).']"

is that this is biased by opportunistic workers who assign the same label to all instances in the HIT, for which we would not expect any sequential bias effects.",3.1 Recognising Textual Entailment (RTE) and Event Temporal Ordering,[0],[0]

"In the method of Graham et al. (2015) — the current best-practise, as adopted by WMT (Bojar et al., 2016) — annotators are asked to judge the adequacy of translations using a 100- point sliding scale which is initialised at the mid point.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]

"We also controlled for worker correlation with mean score, and position of the sentence in the HIT, but these were not significant and did not affect the autocorrelation.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]

"The bias is much stronger with
bad (rejected) workers.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]

"Each HIT consists of 100 sentences, and we divide the dataset into 3 equal groups based on the position of sentence in the HIT.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]
"As shown in Table 4, for good and moderate workers, the bias is stronger in the first group of sentences annotated, decreases in the second, and is much smaller in the last.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]
"This could be because workers are familiarising themselves with the task earlier on, and calibrating their scale.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]
"There is no such trend with bad quality scores, possibly because the workers are not putting in sufficient effort to produce accurate scores.

Next we assess the impact of the bias in the worst case situation.,3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]

"As shown in Table 5 we can see that the sentences in the “low” partition and the “high” partition have a difference of 0.18, which is highly significant;3 moreover, this difference is likely to be sufficiently large to alter the rankings of systems in an evaluation.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[1.0],"['As shown in Table 5 we can see that the sentences in the “low” partition and the “high” partition have a difference of 0.18, which is highly significant;3 moreover, this difference is likely to be sufficiently large to alter the rankings of systems in an evaluation.']"
"The bias remains even when we increase the number of workers and use the average score, as all workers scored the translations in the same order.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]
"This shows that the mean is also affected by
3p < 0.001 using Welch’s two-sample t-test
sequence bias.",3.3 Machine Translation Adequacy,[0],[0]

"We have shown significant sequence effects across several independent crowdsourced datasets: a negative autocorrelation in the RTE and TEMPORAL datasets, and a positive autocorrelation in the MTadeq dataset.",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
The negative autocorrelation can be attributed either to sequential contrast effects or the gambler’s fallacy.,4 Discussion and Conclusions,[1.0],['The negative autocorrelation can be attributed either to sequential contrast effects or the gambler’s fallacy.']
"These effects were not significant for the AFFECTIVE dataset, perhaps due to the nature of the annotation task, whereby annotations of one emotion are separated by six other annotations, thus limiting the potential for sequencing effects.",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"It is also possible that the dataset is too small to obtain statistical significance.
",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[0.9999999687743705],['It is also possible that the dataset is too small to obtain statistical significance.']

"We show that the sequential bias decreases for better workers as they annotate more sentences in the HIT, indicating a learning effect.",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[1.0],"['We show that the sequential bias decreases for better workers as they annotate more sentences in the HIT, indicating a learning effect.']"
"Since the ordering of the systems is random, system scores obtained by averaging scores of all sentences translated by the system would be unbiased, assuming a sufficiently large sample of sentences.",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
Thus we do not expect sequential bias to have a marked effect on system rankings or other macro-level conclusions on the basis of this data.,4 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"However, the scores of in-
dividual translations remain biased, which augurs poorly for the use of these annotations at the sentence level, such as when used in error analysis or for training automatic metrics.

"Sequence problems can be easily addressed by adequate randomisation — providing each individual worker with a separate dataset that has been randomised, such that no two workers see the same ordered data.",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[1.0],"['Sequence problems can be easily addressed by adequate randomisation — providing each individual worker with a separate dataset that has been randomised, such that no two workers see the same ordered data.']"
"In this way sequence bias effects can be considered as independent noise sources, rather than a systematic bias, and consequently the aggregate results over several workers will remain unbiased.

"This study has shown that sequence bias is real, and can distort evaluation and annotation exercises with crowd-workers.",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We limited our scope to binary and continuous responses, however it is likely that sequence effects are prevalent for multinomial and structured outputs, e.g., in discourse and parsing, where priming is known to have a significant effect (Reitter et al., 2006).",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Another important question for future work is whether sequence bias is detectable in expert annotators, not just crowd workers.",4 Discussion and Conclusions,[1.0],"['Another important question for future work is whether sequence bias is detectable in expert annotators, not just crowd workers.']"
