2	24	Due to the tight interconnectedness of the financial system, problems quickly propagated in the global banking system.
3	23	Governments had to bail out important institutions like Northern Rock, but such solutions could not be provided for every troubled bank.
8	40	The EBU consists of three pillars, one of them being a new system of financial supervision, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
11	18	The sources include mainly backwardlooking quantitative Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), which are complemented with surveys in order to include forward-looking information as well (European Banking Authority, 2014).
12	19	However, another source of information seems to be largely untapped, namely textual data published by the banks.
14	14	Analyzing this readily available data would be more cost-efficient in comparison to traditional approaches like surveys.
17	15	In particular, this work (1) finds suitable data sources, (2) identifies appropriate techniques for risk sentiment analysis, and (3) analyzes risk sentiment within the last decade in order to cover the financial crisis of 2007-08 adequately.
54	20	The selected quantitative risk indicator has to represent financial health and the general risk exposure of a bank within a specific period or at a specific point in time.
56	16	A comparison of several quantitative risk indicators based on expert interviews revealed that only the Tier 1 Capital Ratio (T1) fulfills all criteria.
58	15	In particular, it refers to the bank’s Tier 1 capital as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets: Tier 1 Capital Ratio = Tier 1 Capital Risk-Weighted Assets (1) Tier 1 capital is considered as the best form of bank capital and has to fulfill several criteria making it relatively secure.
68	20	The former are carefully crafted documents which contain valuable information about the management’s opinions about risk.
94	16	The first experiment is about analyzing sentiment scores derived from the documents by incorporating finance-specific word lists.
99	15	All of these word lists are provided by Loughran and McDonald (2011).
158	44	The turning point was in 2006—from that time on, negativity in CEO letters rose and quadrupled within three years.
167	38	Another observation is that the average uncertainty scores are much lower than the average positivity and negativity scores.
169	42	Do Sentiment Scores Predict Quantitative Risk Measures?
171	16	The correlation coefficients in Table 3 indicate that a higher degree of uncertainty or negativity in the documents is commonly followed by a higher increase of the T1, and vice versa.
172	25	It is interesting to analyze the data by a regression model for predicting the T1 evolution.
174	27	The coefficients can be interpreted as follows: if the average negativity score rises by one unit, the T1 evolution increases by 0.9963 pp.
189	38	The supervised classification experiment aims to assess whether this approach works better than the lexicon-based approach in terms of predicting the T1 evolution for individual banks based on their CEO letters or outlook sections.
219	15	Applying the model on data of individual banks leads to inaccurate results.
222	89	The supervised risk classification approach correctly classifies 79.2 % of the CEO letters.
223	107	This is not good if one considers that it is possible to yield an accuracy of 70 % simply by assigning the class UP to every instance.
224	84	However, if the results of the best SVM classifier are aggregated by year, the data correctly predict for 12 out of 13 years whether the majority of banks will increase or decrease their Tier 1 capital ratio.
225	78	The described systems have the potential to provide valuable insights for banking supervisors, in particular because of the strong correlation between sentiment scores derived from textual data and the T1.
226	46	Because of the mentioned limitations, these techniques should only be used for macroprudential analyses, i.e. the promotion of stability in the whole financial system.
228	24	Another option is to improve existing risk prediction frameworks.
229	27	For future research, it would be interesting to validate the results by conducting the study on a larger scale.
230	18	One could incorporate data from all European banks, or from other regions.
232	31	Regarding the methodology, it would be interesting to see how alternative algorithms or word lists would affect the results.
