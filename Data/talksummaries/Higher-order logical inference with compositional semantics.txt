4	17	However, there are still obstacles in the way of achieving this goal.
6	49	Another persistent problem is the gap between the logics employed in the two com- munities; while it is generally assumed among formal semanticists that adequate semantic representations for natural language demand higher-order logic or type theory (Carpenter, 1997), the dominant view in computational linguistics is that inferences based on higher-order logic are hopelessly inefficient for practical applications (Bos, 2009a).
9	30	Moreover, the coverage of existing natural logic systems is limited to single-premise inferences (MacCartney and Manning, 2008).
10	41	In this paper, we first present an improved compositional semantics that fills the gap between the parser syntax and a composition derivation.
11	16	We then develop an inference system that is capable of higher-order inferences in natural languages.
14	12	We test our system on the FraCaS test suite (Cooper et al., 1994), which is suitable for evaluating the linguistic coverage of an inference system.
16	34	As an initial step of compositional semantics, we use the C&C parser (Clark and Curran, 2007), a statistical CCG parser trained on CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007).
37	36	We use the language of higher-order logic (HOL) with two basic types, E for entities and Prop for propositions.
48	8	But we choose to adopt the first-order decomposition in such cases (see Fig.
54	8	We prefer the higher-order approach, because the firstorder approaches introduce additional quantifiers and variables at the level of the semantic representations on which one makes inferences.
60	59	For example, Some student manages to come is formalized as (3) ∃x(student(x) ∧manage(x, come(x))) where manage is a veridical predicate taking a proposition as the second argument; it licenses an inference to ∃x(student(x) ∧ come(x)).
66	23	We use Coq’s built-in tactics for first-order inferences.
68	17	The additional axioms and tactics specialized for natural language constructions are written in Ltac.
69	14	We ran Coq fully automated, by feeding to its interactive mode a set of predefined tactics combined with user-defined proof-search tactics.
71	9	Modals and non-veridical predicates (by which we mean predicates that are neither veridical nor antiveridical) do not have particular axioms, with the consequence that actual and hypothetical contexts are correctly distinguished.
72	24	We evaluated our system on the FraCaS test suite (Cooper et al., 1994), a set of entailment problems that is designed to evaluate theories of formal semantics.5 We used the version provided by MacCartney and Manning (2007).
76	17	There are three types of answer: yes (the premise set entails the hypothesis), no (the premise set entails the negation of the hypothesis), and unknown (the premise set entails neither the hypothesis nor its negation).
82	20	We used the Nutcracker system based on Boxer that utilizes a first-order prover (Bliksem) and a model builder (Mace) with the option enabling access to WordNet.
85	9	Experimental results are shown in Table 3.
86	24	Our system improved on Nutcracker.
93	11	These systems were only evaluated on the Quantifier section of FraCaS.
96	14	These systems are designed solely for single-premise inferences and hence are incapable of handling the general case of multiple-premise problems (which cover about 45% of the problems in FraCaS).
97	23	Our system improves on these natural-logic-based systems by making multiple-premise inferences as well.
98	21	Main errors we found are due to various parse errors caused by the CCG parser, including the failure to handle multiwords like a lot of.
100	9	Our experiments on FraCaS problems do not constitute an evaluation on real texts nor on unseen test data.
101	18	Note, however, that a benefit of using a linguistically controlled set of entailment problems is that one can check not only whether, but also how each semantic phenomenon is handled by the system.
102	16	In contrast to the widely held view that higher-order logic is less useful in computational linguistics, our results demonstrate the logical capacity of a higher-order inference system integrated with the CCG-based compositional semantics.
103	33	We have presented a framework for a compositional semantics based on the wide-coverage CCG parser, combined with a higher-order inference system.
104	58	The experimental results on the FraCaS test suite have shown that a reasonable number of lexical entries and non-first-order axioms enable various logical inferences in an efficient way and outperform the state-of-the-art first-order system.
105	49	Future work will focus on incorporating a robust model of lexical knowledge (Lewis and Steedman, 2013; Tian et al., 2014) to our framework.
