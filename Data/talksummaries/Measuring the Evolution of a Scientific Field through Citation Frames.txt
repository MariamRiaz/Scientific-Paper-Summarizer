4	56	However, we know relatively little about how these citation frames develop over time within a field and what impact they have on scientific uptake.
13	74	We apply our method to label the field of NLP, with over 134,127 citations in over 20,000 papers from nearly forty years of work.
15	57	We introduce a new large-scale representative corpus of citation function and state-of-the-art methodology for classifying citations by function.
18	100	Finally, by examining changes in the usage of citation functions, we show that the scholarly NLP community has evolved in how its authors frame their work, reflecting the maturation and growth of the field as a rapid discovery science (Collins, 1994).
19	50	We publicly release our dataset and code to enable future research.
20	42	Citations play a key role in supporting authors’ contributions throughout a scientific paper.1 Multiple schemes have been proposed on how to classify these different roles, ranging from a handful of classes (Nanba and Okumura, 1999; Pham and Hoffmann, 2003) to twenty or more (Garfield, 1979; Garzone and Mercer, 2000).
29	30	Additionally, we introduce the FUTURE class to indicate that authors have forward-looking references for how their work might be applied later; these references are important for establishing a temporal lineage between works, and as we show later in §4, are the most frequent citation type in papers’ Conclusion sections.
44	91	Our work draws on multiple approaches (Hernández-Alvarez and Gomez, 2016) to develop a classifier based on (1) structural features describing where the citation is located, (2) lexical and grammatical features for how the citation is described, (3) field features that take into account venue or other external information, and (4) usage features on how the reference is cited throughout the paper.

50	61	Our patterns are a sequence of cue phrases, parts of speech, or lexical categories, like positive-sentiment words or specific categories that allow generalizations across phrases like “we extend” and “we build upon.” We began with the largest publicly-available list of citation patterns (Teufel, 2000) and extended it with 132 new patterns and 13 new lexical categories based on a manual analysis of the corpus.
66	80	For example, EXTENDS citations occur frequently as objects of verbs such as “follow” and “use”, whereas USES citations have techniques or artifact words as dependents; Table 6 shows more examples.
83	33	Stratifying by paper instead of instance is critical: since multiple citations may appear in the same sentence, instance-based stratification would leak information between training and test.
101	49	The closest-performing system was that of Abu-Jbara et al. (2013), which also had a heavily-lexicon based approach.
114	44	Scientific papers commonly follow a structured section narrative to frame their contributions: Introduction, Methodology, Results, and Discussion (Skelton, 1994; Nwogu, 1997).
119	74	The resulting distributions of citation function (Figure 2), show that authors’ citation framing indeed parallels the expected rhetorical framing seen in the writing: (1) establishing an intellectual lineage via BACKGROUND citations in the Introduction, Motivation, and Related Work sections to (2) introducing methodology with USES citations in the Methodology and Evaluation sections, (3) a large increase in COMPARISON OR CONTRAST for related literature in the Results and Discussions, and finally (4) closing comparisons and pointers to future directions.
124	60	To what degree do venue genres affect the way authors cite?
130	31	Workshops, by contrast, have relatively little comparison and instead use more BACKGROUND; the experimental nature of workshop papers presumably results in fewer potential prospects for compar- ison.
141	43	Here, we test this hypothesis by measuring whether workshop papers have become more similar in their citation framing to papers from the main conferences.
181	29	Specifically, we expect that as consensus is reached (1) authors are expected to have fewer comparisons to other works and instead can simply acknowledge past work as background and (2) the remaining comparisons concentrate on fewer works, reflecting those works’ status as accepted benchmarks of performance.
185	37	Results The NLP field shows a significant increase in consensus consistent with the rise in rapid discovery science, evidenced through two main trends.
186	42	First, NLP authors use a decreasing number of comparison and contrast citations (r= -0.899, p ≤ 0.01) as seen in Figure 5.
194	61	Unlimited extra space for citations acted to modify authors’ citation framing behavior; given unlimited space, authors chose to include proportionally more non-methodological citations.9 In the second trend, authors are more likely to use and compare against the same set of papers, as shown in Figure 6 by the rise in expected incoming citations to those works compared against (r= 0.734, p ≤ 0.01) and used (r=0.889, p ≤ 0.01).
195	88	For example, in 1991, authors compared with a diffuse group of parsing papers, e.g., (Shieber, 1988; Pereira and Warren, 1983; Haas, 1989), with such papers receiving at most three citations that year; whereas in 2000, most comparisons were to a core set of parsing papers, e.g., (Collins, 1999; Buchholz et al., 1999; Collins, 1997), with a much sharper (lower entropy) distribution of citations.
201	46	A careful analysis of citation reveals that authors cite works for multiple reasons—as background, motivation, extension, use, contrast, or future.
202	44	When authors utilize some forms of citation over others they can significantly influence how their own work gets perceived and taken up by others (Latour, 1987).
204	79	Moreover, a differentiation of citation functions affords a deeper understanding of how scholars develop arguments for different publication venues as well as how these venues may demand different forms of knowledge representation and arguments over time.
205	79	In fact, these modes of citation help us understand the state of research efforts and their evolution more broadly for entire scientific fields like NLP.
208	67	We then show that citation framing reveals salient behaviors of writers, readers, and the field as a whole: (1) authors are sensitive to discourse structure and venue when citing, (2) ACL workshops have evolved to become more like the mainstream conferences, with multi-iteration workshops being quicker to establish conference-like norms, (3) the way in which an author frames their work aids in predicting its future impact as the number of citations its receives, with the community favoring works that integrate many new technologies and also relate to prior work through comparison and contrast, and (4) the NLP field as a whole has seen increased consensus in what constitutes valid work— with a reduced need for positioning and excessive comparison—demonstrating its shift towards rapid discovery science.
213	95	As a part of training the classifier, instances from Teufel (2010) are used to supplement rare classes.
215	40	We convert the instances from their dataset as follows: Teufel et al.
