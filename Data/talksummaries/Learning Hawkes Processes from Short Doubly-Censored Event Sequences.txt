8	47	This problem is a thorny issue in several practical applications, especially in those having timevarying triggering patterns.
9	14	For example, the disease networks of patients should evolve with the increase of age.
14	31	Given a set of SDC event sequences, we sample predecessor for each event sequence from potential candidates and stitch them together as new training data.
17	18	Experimental results show that our data synthesis method indeed helps to improve the robustness of various learning algorithms for Hawkes processes.
40	17	Suppose that the original complete event sequences are in a long observation window.
42	60	Although we can still apply maximum likelihood estimator to learn Hawkes processes, i.e., minΘ− ∑ n,k logL(snk ; Θ), (3) the SDC event sequences would lead to over-fitting problem and the loss of triggering patterns.
49	15	(4) Here Ex∼D[f(x)] represents the expectation of function f(x) with random variable x yielding to a distribution D. s ∼ HCTnb means all possible history before T n b , and L([s, snk ]; Θ) is the likelihood of stitched sequence [s, snk ].
50	29	The stitched sequence [s, snk ] can be generated via sampling SDC sequence s from previous 1st, ..., (k− 1)-th intervals and stitching s to snk .
52	13	Given snk , we can compute its similarity between its potential predecessor sn ′ k′ in [T n′ b , T n′ e ] as w(sn ′ k′ , s n k ) = { 0, when Tn ′ e ≥ Tnb S(Tnb , T n′ e )S(f n k , f n′ k′ ), o.w.
55	25	Note that the availability of feature is optional — even if the feature of sequence is unavailable, we can still define the similarity measurement purely based on time stamps.
56	30	The normalized {w(sn′k′ , snk )} provides us with the probability that sn ′ k′ appears before snk , i.e., p(s n′ k′ |snk ) ∝ w(sn ′ k′ , s n k ).
58	17	We can apply such a sampling-stitching mechanism L times iteratively to the SDC sequences in both backward and forward directions and get long stitched event sequences.
82	29	For Hawkes processes, whose intensity function is defined as (2), our data synthesis method can enhance the robustness of learning algorithm generally.
85	18	(8) If the events in the first interval are unobserved, we just have a SDC event sequence, and the second term in (8) is unavailable.
91	32	(9) Here, we decompose impact functions into two parts: 1) Infectivity ψcc′(t) = ∑M m=1 acc′mκm(t) represents the infectivity of event type c′ to c at time t.1 2) Triggering kernel g(t) = exp(−βt) measures the time decay of infectivity.
95	12	Hawkes process is a kind of physically-interpretable model for many natural and social phenomena.
105	33	Based on (1, 9), the log-likelihood function is logL(sn; Θ) = ∑In i=1 log λci(ti)− ∑C c=1 ∫ Tne Tnb λc(s)ds = ∑In i=1 log [ µcni + ∑ j<i g(τnij) ∑ m acni cnjmκm(t n i ) ] − ∑C c=1 ( ∆nµc − ∑ m ∑In i=1 ∑ j≤i accnjmGij ) , where τnij = t n i − tnj , Gij = ∫ tni+1 tni κm(s)g(s − tnj )ds, and ∆n = Tne − Tnb .
135	25	For time-varying Hawkes processes, we set ψcc′(t) = 0.2 cos(2π ωcc′ 50 t), where {ωcc′} are randomly generated in the range [1, 4].
136	14	Given these complete event sequences, we select 1000 sequences as testing set while the remaining 1000 sequences as training set.
141	22	2(a) we can find that compared with the learning results based on complete event sequences, the results based on SDC event sequences degrade a lot (lower log-likelihood and higher relative error) because of the loss of information.
144	37	2(b) shows that our method also improves the learning results of the LS algorithm in the case of SDC event sequences.
164	18	In other words, the infectivity network among different companies should be dynamical w.r.t.
173	54	The properties of the network verifies the rationality of our results: 1) the diagonal elements of the adjacent matrix are larger than other elements in general, which reflects the fact that most employees would like to stay in the same company and achieve a series of internal promotions; 2) with the increase of age, the infectivity network becomes sparse, which reflects the fact that users are more likely to try different companies in the early stages of their careers.
174	13	The MIMIC III data contain admission records of over 40, 000 patients in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.
187	17	For example, for kids (“Age 0” network), the typical circulatory diseases are “diseases of mitral and aortic valves” (ICD-9 396) and “cardiac dysrhythmias” (ICD-9 427), which are common for premature babies and the kids having congenital heart disease.
188	16	For the old (“Age 80” network), the network becomes dense.
189	50	We can find that 1) as a main cause of death, “heart failure” (ICD-9 428) is triggered via multiple other diseases, especially “secondary hypertension” (ICD-9 405); 2) “sec- ondary hypertension” is also likely to cause “other and illdefined cerebrovascular disease” (ICD-9 437); 3) “Hemorrhoids” (ICD-9 455), as a common disease with strong self-triggering pattern, will cause frequent admissions of patients.
194	47	Applying a sampling-stitching mechanism, we successfully synthesize a large amount of long event sequences and learn point processes robustly.
196	14	Experiments show that our data synthesis method improves the robustness of learning algorithms for various models.
197	71	In the future, we plan to provide more theoretical and quantitative analysis to our data synthesis method and apply it to more applications.
