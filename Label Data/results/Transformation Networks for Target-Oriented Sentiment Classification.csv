"Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a key task in computational lexical semantics, inasmuch as it addresses the lexical ambiguity of text by making explicit the meaning of words occurring in a given context (Navigli, 2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Anyone who has struggled with frustratingly unintelligible translations from an automatic system, or with the meaning bias of search engines, can understand the importance for an intelligent system to go beyond the surface appearance of text.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
There are two mainstream lines of research in WSD: supervised and knowledge-based WSD.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Supervised WSD frames the problem as a classical machine learning task in which, first a training phase occurs aimed at learning a classification model from sentences annotated with word senses and, second the model is applied to previouslyunseen sentences focused on a target word.",1 Introduction,[0.953503100723632],"['The top most part is a position-aware convolutional layer which first encodes positional relevance between a word and a target, and then extracts informative features for classification.']"
"A key
difference from many other problems, however, is that the classes to choose from (i.e., the senses of a target word) vary for each word, therefore requiring a separate training process to be performed on a word by word basis.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, hundreds of training instances are needed for each ambiguous word in the vocabulary.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This would necessitate a million-item training set to be manually created for each language of interest, an endeavour that is currently beyond reach even in resource-rich languages like English.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The second paradigm, i.e., knowledge-based WSD, takes a radically different approach: the idea is to exploit a general-purpose knowledge resource like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to develop an algorithm which can take advantage of the structural and lexical-semantic information in the resource to choose among the possible senses of a target word occurring in context.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, a PageRank-based algorithm can be developed to determine the probability of a given sense being reached starting from the senses of its context words.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent approaches of this kind have been shown to obtain competitive results (Agirre et al., 2014; Moro et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, due to its inherent nature, knowledge-based WSD tends to adopt bag-of-word approaches which do not exploit the local lexical context of a target word, including function and collocation words, which limits this approach in some cases.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper we get the best of both worlds and present Train-O-Matic, a novel method for generating huge high-quality training sets for all the words in a language’s vocabulary.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The approach is language-independent, thanks to its use of a multilingual knowledge resource, BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), and it can be applied to any kind of corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The training sets produced with Train-O-Matic are shown to provide competitive performance with those of manually and semi-
78
automatically tagged corpora.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, state-ofthe-art performance is also reported for low resourced languages (i.e., Italian and Spanish) and domains, where manual training data is not available.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this Section we present Train-O-Matic, a language-independent approach to the automatic construction of a sense-tagged training set.",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"TrainO-Matic takes as input a corpus C (e.g., Wikipedia) and a semantic network G = (V,E).",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"We assume a WordNet-like structure of G, i.e., V is the set of concepts (i.e., synsets) such that, for each word w in the vocabulary, Senses(w) is the set of vertices in V that are expressed by w, e.g., the WordNet synsets that include w as one of their senses.
",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"Train-O-Matic consists of three steps:
• Lexical profiling: for each vertex in the semantic network, we compute its Personalized PageRank vector, which provides its lexicalsemantic profile (Section 2.1).
",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"• Sentence scoring: For each sentence containing a word w, we compute a probability distribution over all the senses of w based on its context (Section 2.2).
",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"• Sentence ranking and selection: for each sense s of a word w in the vocabulary, we select those sentences that are most likely to use w in the sense of s (Section 2.3).",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
In terms of semantic networks the probability of reaching a node v′ starting from v can be interpreted as a measure of relatedness between the synsets v,2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
and v′.,2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"Thus we define the lexical profile of a vertex v in a graph G = (V,E) as the probability distribution over all the vertices v′ in the graph.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"Such distribution is computed by applying the Personalized PagaRank algorithm, a variant of the traditional PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998).",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"While the latter is equivalent to performing random walks with uniform restart probability on every vertex at each step, PPR, on the other hand, makes the restart probability non-uniform, thereby concentrating more probability mass in the surroundings of those vertices having higher restart
probability.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"Formally, (P)PR is computed as follows:
v(t+1) =",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"(1− α)v(0) + αMv(t) (1)
where M is the row-normalized adjacency matrix of the semantic network, the restart probability distribution is encoded by vector v(0), and α is the well-known damping factor usually set to 0.85 (Brin and Page, 1998).",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"If we set v(0) to a unit probability vector (0, . . .",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
", 0, 1, 0, . . .",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
", 0), i.e., restart is always on a given vertex, PPR outputs the probability of reaching every vertex starting from the restart vertex after a certain number of steps.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"This approach has been used in the literature to create semantic signatures (i.e., profiles) of individual concepts, i.e., vertices of the semantic network (Pilehvar et al., 2013), and then to determine the semantic similarity of concepts.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0.9643591742687991],"['Similar to the gate mechanism in RNN variants (Jozefowicz et al., 2015), Adaptive Scaling introduces a gating function to control the passed proportions of the transformed features and the input features.']"
"As also done by Pilehvar and Collier (2016), we instead use the PPR vector as an estimate of the conditional probability of a word w′",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"given the target sense1 s ∈ V of word w:
P (w′|s, w) = maxs′∈Senses(w′) vs(s ′)
Z (2)
where Z = ∑
w” P (w”|s, w) is a normalization constant, vs is the vector resulting from an adequate number of random walks used to calculate PPR, and vs(s′) is the vector component corresponding to sense s′.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"To fix the number of iterations needed to have a sufficiently accurate vector, we follow Lofgren et al. (2014) and set the error δ = 0.00001 and the number of iterations to 1 δ = 100, 000.
",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
As a result of this lexical profiling step we have a probability distribution over vocabulary words for each given word sense of interest.,2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
The objective of the second step is to score the importance of word senses for each of the corpus sentences which contain the word of interest.,2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]

"P (wi|s, w) is calculated as in Formula 2 and P (s|w) is set to 1/|Senses(w)| (recall that s is a sense of w).",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"For example, given the sentence σ =",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"“A match is a tool for starting a fire”, the target word w = match and its set of senses Smatch = {s1match, s2match}, where s1match is the sense of lighter and s2match is the sense of game match, we want to calculate the probability of each simatch ∈ Smatch of being the correct sense of match in the sentence σ.",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"Following Formula 5 we have:
P (s1match|σ,match)",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"≈ P (tool|s1match,match) · P (start|s1match,match) · P (fire|s1match,match) · P (s1match|match) = 2.1 · 10−4 · 2 · 10−3 · 10−2 · 5 · 10−1 = 2.1 · 10−9
P (s2match|σ,match)",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"≈ P (tool|s2match,match) ·",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"P (start|s2match,match) · P (fire|s2match,match) · P (s2match|match) = 10−5 · 2.9 · 10−4 · 10−6 · 5 · 10−1 = 1.45 · 10−15
As can be seen, the first sense of match has a much higher probability due to its stronger relatedness to the other words in the context (i.e. start, fire and tool).",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
Note also that all the probabilities for the second sense are at least one magnitude less than the probability of the first sense.,2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"Finally, for a given word w and a given sense s1 ∈ Senses(w), we score each sentence σ in which w appears and s1 is its most likely sense according to a formula that takes into account the difference between the first (i.e., s1) and the second most likely sense of w in σ:

"= P (s1|σ,w)− P (s2|σ,w) (6) where s1 = arg maxs∈Senses(w) P (s|σ,w), and s2 = arg maxs∈Senses(w)\{s1} P (s|σ,w).",2.3 Sense-based sentence ranking and selection,[0],[0]
We then sort all sentences based on ∆s1(·) and return a ranked list of sentences where word w is most likely to be sense-annotated with s1.,2.3 Sense-based sentence ranking and selection,[0],[0]
"Although we recognize that other scoring strategies could have been used, this was experimentally the most effective one when compared to alternative strategies, i.e., the sense probability, the number of words related to the target word w, the sentence length or a combination thereof.",2.3 Sense-based sentence ranking and selection,[0],[0]
"In the previous Section we assumed that WordNet was our semantic network, with synsets as vertices and edges represented by its semantic relations.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"However, while its lexical coverage is high, with a rich set of fine-grained synsets, at the relation level WordNet provides mainly paradigmatic information, i.e., relations like hypernymy (is-a) and meronymy (part-of).",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"It lacks, on the other hand, syntagmatic relations, such as those that connect verb synsets to their arguments (e.g., the appropriate senses of eatv and foodn), or pairs of noun synsets (e.g., the appropriate senses of busn and drivern).
",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, Train-O-Matic would suffer from such a lack of syntagmatic relations, as the relevance of a sense for a given word in a sentence depends directly on the possibility of visiting senses of the other words in the same sentence (cf.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
Formula 5) via random walks as calculated with Formula 1.,3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
Such reachability depends on the connections available between synsets.,3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Because syntagmatic relations are sparse in WordNet, if it was used on its own, we would end up with a poor ranking of sentences for any given word sense.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Moreover, even though the methodology presented in Section 2 is languageindependent, Train-O-Matic would lack informa-
tion (e.g. senses for a word in an arbitrary vocabulary) for languages other than English.
",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"To cope with these issues, we exploit BabelNet,2 a huge multilingual semantic network obtained from the automatic integration of WordNet, Wikipedia, Wiktionary and other resources (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), and create the BabelNet subgraph induced by the WordNet vertices.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
The result is a graph whose vertices are BabelNet synsets that contain at least one WordNet synset and whose edge set includes all those relations in BabelNet coming either from WordNet itself or from links in other resources mapped to WordNet (such as hyperlinks in a Wikipedia article connecting it to other articles).,3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"The greatest contribution of syntagmatic relations comes, indeed, from Wikipedia, as its articles are linked to related articles (e.g., the English Wikipedia Bus article3 is linked to Passenger, Tourism, Bus lane, Timetable, School, and many more).
",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Because not all Wikipedia (and other resources’) pages are connected with the same degree of relatedness (e.g., countries are often linked, but they are not necessarily closely related to the source article in which the link occurs), we apply the following weighting strategy to each edge (s, s′) ∈ E of our WordNet-induced subgraph of BabelNet G = (V,E):

"Comparison sense-annotated corpora To show the impact of our T-O-M corpora in WSD, we compared its performance on the above gold standard datasets, against training with:
• SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), a corpus containing about 226,000 words annotated manually with WordNet senses.

"• One Million Sense-Tagged Instances (Taghipour and Ng, 2015, OMSTI), a sense-annotated dataset obtained via a semi-automatic approach based on the disambiguation of a parallel corpus, i.e., the United Nations Parallel Corpus, performed by exploiting manually translated word senses.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Because OMSTI integrates SemCor
to increase coverage, to keep a level playing field we excluded the latter from the corpus.
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We note that T-O-M, instead, is fully automatic and does not require any WSD-specific human intervention nor any aligned corpus.
Reference system In all our experiments, we used It Makes Sense (Zhong and Ng, 2010, IMS), a state-of-the-art WSD system based on linear Support Vector Machines, as our reference system for comparing its performance when trained on TO-M, against the same WSD system trained on other sense-annotated corpora (i.e., SemCor and OMSTI).",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Following the WSD literature, unless stated otherwise, we report performance in terms of F1, i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We note that it is not the purpose of this paper to show that T-O-M, when integrated into IMS, beats all other configurations or alternative systems, but rather to fully automatize the WSD pipeline with performances which are competitive with the state of the art.

Baseline,4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"As a traditional baseline in WSD, we used the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline given by the first sense in WordNet.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]

Similar performance losses were observed when using T-O-MUN (see Table 3).,5.1 Impact of syntagmatic relations,[0],[0]
This corroborates our hunch discussed in Section 3 that a resource like BabelNet can contribute important syntagmatic relations that are beneficial for identifying (and ranking high) sentences which are semantically relevant for the target word sense.,5.1 Impact of syntagmatic relations,[0],[0]

"The MFS is in the same ballpark as T-O-MWiki, performing better on some datasets and worse on others.",5.2 Comparison against sense-annotated corpora,[0],[0]

"We view this as a significant achievement given the total absence of manual effort involved in T-O-M.

"IMS uses the MFS as a backoff strategy when no sense can be output for a target word in context (Zhong and Ng, 2010).",5.3 Performance without backoff strategy,[0],[0]

"T-O-M performances, instead, remain high in terms of precision, recall and F1.",5.3 Performance without backoff strategy,[0],[0]
"This confirms that OMSTI relies heavily on data (those obtained for the MFS and from SemCor) that are produced manually, rather than semi-automatically.",5.3 Performance without backoff strategy,[0],[0]
"To further inspect the ability of T-O-M to enable disambiguation in different domains, we decided to evaluate on specific documents from the various gold standard datasets which could be clearly assigned a domain label.",5.4 Domain-oriented WSD,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we tested on 13 SemEval-13 documents from various domains6 and 2 SemEval-15 documents (namely, maths & computers, and biomedicine) and carried out two separate tests and evaluations of T-O-M on each domain: once using the MFS backoff strategy, and once not using it.",5.4 Domain-oriented WSD,[0],[0]

"Its performance was in fact, 1 to 3 points higher, with a 6-point peak on Maths & Computer in Spanish and on Biomedicine in Italian.",6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
This demonstrates the ability of Train-O-Matic to enable supervised WSD systems to surpass state-of-theart knowledge-based WSD approaches in lowresourced languages without relying on manually curated data for training.,6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
There are two mainstream approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation: supervised and knowledge-based approaches.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]

The latter also integrates a label propagation algorithm in order to enrich the sense annotated dataset.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]

"In order to generalize effectively, these supervised systems require large numbers of training in-
stances annotated with senses for each target word occurrence.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Overall, this amounts to millions of training instances for each language of interest, a number that is not within reach for any language.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In fact, no supervised system has been submitted in major multilingual WSD competitions for languages other than English (Navigli et al., 2013; Moro and Navigli, 2015).",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To overcome this problem, new methodologies have recently been developed which aim to create sense-tagged corpora automatically.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
Raganato et al. (2016) developed 7 heuristics to grow the number of hyperlinks in Wikipedia pages.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Otegi et al. (2016) applied a different disambiguation pipeline for each language to parallel text in Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and QTLeap (Agirre et al., 2015) in order to enrich them with semantic annotations.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Taghipour and Ng (2015), the work closest to ours, exploits the alignment from English to Chinese sentences of
the United Nation Parallel Corpus (Ziemski et al., 2016) to reduce the ambiguity of English words and sense-tag English sentences.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
The assumption is that the second language is less ambiguous than the first one and that hand-made translations of senses are available for each WordNet synset.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This approach is, therefore, semi-automatic and relies on certain assumptions, in contrast to TrainO-Matic which is, instead, fully automatic and can be applied to any kind of corpus (and language) depending on the specific need.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
Earlier attempts at the automatic extraction of training samples were made by Agirre and De Lacalle (2004) and Fernández et al. (2004).,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Both exploited the monosemous relatives method (Leacock et al., 1998) in order to retrieve sentences from the Web which contained a given monosemous noun or a relative monosemous word (e.g., a synonym, a hypernym, etc.).",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in (Fernández et al., 2004)",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"this approach can lead to the retrieval of very accurate examples, but its main drawback lies in the number of senses covered.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In fact, for all those synsets that do not have any monosemous relative, the system is unable to retrieve examples, thus heavily affecting the performance in terms of recall and F1.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Knowledge-based WSD, instead, bypasses the heavy requirement of sense-annotated corpora by applying algorithms that exploit a general-purpose semantic network, such as WordNet, which encodes the relational information that interconnects synsets via different kinds of relation.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Approaches include variants of Personalized PageRank (Agirre et al., 2014) and densest subgraph approximation algorithms (Moro et al., 2014) which, thanks to the availability of multilingual resources such as BabelNet, can easily be extended to perform WSD in arbitrary languages.",7 Related Work,[0.9502683178080277],"['To some extent, this drawback is rooted in the attention mechanism, as also observed in machine translation (Luong et al., 2015) and image captioning (Xu et al., 2015).']"
Other approaches to knowledge-based WSD exploit the definitional knowledge contained in a dictionary.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986) and its variants (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002; Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000; Vasilescu et al., 2004) aim to determine the correct sense of a word by comparing each wordsense definition with the context in which the target word appears.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The limit of knowledge-based WSD, however, lies in the absence of mechanisms that can take into account the very local context of a target word occurrence, including non-content words such as prepositions and articles.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, recent studies seem to suggest that such
approaches are barely able to surpass supervised WSD systems when they enrich their networks starting from a comparable amount of annotated data (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014).",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"With T-O-M, rather than further enriching an existing semantic network, we exploit the information available in the network to annotate raw sentences with sense information and train a state-of-the-art supervised WSD system without task-specific human annotations.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]

"T-O-M was shown to provide training data for virtually all the target ambiguous nouns, in marked contrast to alternatives like OMSTI, which covers in many cases around half of the tokens, resorting to the MFS otherwise.",8 Conclusion,[0],[0]

Neural machine translation has recently become a method of choice in machine translation research.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Besides its success in traditional settings of machine translation, that is one-to-one translation between two languages, (Sennrich et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2016), neural machine translation has ventured into more sophisticated settings of machine translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, neural machine translation has successfully proven itself to be capable of
handling subword-level representation of sentences (Lee et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016; Sennrich et al., 2015; Costa-Jussa and Fonollosa, 2016; Ling et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, several research groups have shown its potential in seamlessly handling multiple languages (Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a; Firat et al., 2016a,b; Lee et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016; Viégas et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A typical scenario of neural machine translation starts with training a model to maximize its log-likelihood.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"That is, we often train a model to maximize the conditional probability of a reference translation given a source sentence over a large parallel corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Once the model is trained in this way, it defines the conditional distribution over all possible translations given a source sentence, and the task of translation becomes equivalent to finding a translation to which the model assigns the highest conditional probability.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since it is computationally intractable to do so exactly, it is a usual practice to resort to approximate search/decoding algorithms such as greedy decoding or beam search.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this scenario, we have identified two points where improvements could be made.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"They are (1) training (including the selection of a model architecture) and (2) decoding.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Much of the research on neural machine translation has focused solely on the former, that is, on improving the model architecture.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Neural machine translation started with with a simple encoderdecoder architecture in which a source sentence is encoded into a single, fixed-size vector (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).",1 Introduction,[0.9521863971976925],"['CPT also contains a contextpreserving mechanism, resembling identity mapping (He et al., 2016a,b) and highway connection (Srivastava et al., 2015a,b), allows preserving the context information and learning more abstract word-level features using a deep network.']"
"It soon evolved with the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A few variants of the attention mechanism, or its regularization, have been proposed recently to improve both the translation quality as well as the computational efficiency (Luong et al., 2015b; Cohn et al., 2016; Tu et al., 2016b).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More recently, convolutional net-
1968
works have been adopted either as a replacement of or a complement to a recurrent network in order to efficiently utilize parallel computing (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Gehring et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the aspect of decoding, only a few research groups have tackled this problem by incorporating a target decoding algorithm into training.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Wiseman and Rush (2016) and Shen et al. (2015) proposed a learning algorithm tailored for beam search.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Ranzato et al. (2015) and (Bahdanau et al., 2016) suggested to use a reinforcement learning algorithm by viewing a neural machine translation model as a policy function.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Investigation on decoding alone has, however, been limited.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Cho (2016) showed the limitation of greedy decoding by simply injecting unstructured noise into the hidden state of the neural machine translation system.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Tu et al. (2016a) similarly showed that the exactness of beam search does not correlate well with actual translation quality, and proposed to augment the learning cost function with reconstruction to alleviate this problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Li et al. (2016) proposed a modification to the existing beam search algorithm to improve its exploration of the translation space.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we tackle the problem of decoding in neural machine translation by introducing a concept of trainable greedy decoding.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Instead of manually designing a new decoding algorithm suitable for neural machine translation, we propose to learn a decoding algorithm with an arbitrary decoding objective.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More specifically, we introduce a neural-network-based decoding algorithm that works on an already-trained neural machine translation system by observing and manipulating its hidden state.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We treat such a neural network as an agent with a deterministic, continuous action and train it with a variant of the deterministic policy gradient algorithm (Silver et al., 2014).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We extensively evaluate the proposed trainable greedy decoding on four language pairs (En-Cs, En-De, En-Ru and En-Fi; in both directions) with two different decoding objectives; sentence-level BLEU and negative perplexity.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"By training such trainable greedy decoding using deterministic policy gradient with the proposed critic-aware actor learning, we observe that we can improve decoding performance with minimal computational overhead.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, the trained actors are found to improve beam search as well, suggesting a future research direction in extending the proposed idea of trainable decoding for more sophisticated
underlying decoding algorithms.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Neural machine translation is a special case of conditional recurrent language modeling, where the source and target are natural language sentences.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Let us use X = {x1, . . .",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
", xTs} and Y = {y1, . . .",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
", yT } to denote source and target sentences, respectively.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Neural machine translation then models the target sentence given the source sentence as: p(Y |X) = ∏Tt=1 p(yt|y<t, X).",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
Each term on the r.h.s.,2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"of the equation above is modelled as a composite of two parametric functions:
p(yt|y<t, X) ∝",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"exp (g (yt, zt; θg)) ,
where zt = f(zt−1, yt−1, et(X; θe); θf ).",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"g is a read-out function that transforms the hidden state zt into the distribution over all possible symbols, and f is a recurrent function that compresses all the previous target words y<t and the time-dependent representation et(X; θe) of the source sentence X .",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"This time-dependent representation et is often implemented as a recurrent network encoder of the source sentence coupled with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014).
",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Maximum Likelihood Learning We train a neural machine translation model, or equivalently estimate the parameters θg, θf and θe, by maximizing the log-probability of a reference translation Ŷ = {ŷ1, ..., ŷT } given a source sentence.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"That is, we maximize the log-likelihood function:
JML(θg, θf , θe) = 1 N N∑ n=1",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Tn∑ t=1 log pθ(ŷnt |ŷn<t, Xn),
given a training set consisting of N source-target sentence pairs.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
It is important to note that this maximum likelihood learning does not take into account how a trained model would be used.,2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Rather, it is only concerned with learning a distribution over all possible translations.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Once the model is trained, either by maximum likelihood learning or by any other recently proposed algorithms (Wiseman and Rush, 2016; Shen et al., 2015; Bahdanau et al., 2016; Ranzato et al., 2015), we can let the model translate a given sentence by
finding a translation that maximizes
Ŷ = arg max Y
log pθ(Y |X),
where θ = (θg, θf , θe).",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"This is, however, computationally intractable, and it is a usual practice to resort to approximate decoding algorithms.
",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
Greedy Decoding One such approximate decoding algorithm is greedy decoding.,2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"In greedy decoding, we follow the conditional dependency path and pick the symbol with the highest conditional probability so far at each node.",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
This is equivalent to picking the best symbol one at a time from left to right in conditional language modelling.,2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"A decoded translation of greedy decoding is Ŷ = (ŷ1, . . .",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
", ŷT ), where
ŷt = arg max y∈V
log pθ(y|ŷ<t, X).",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"(1)
Despite its preferable computational complexity O(|V | × T ), greedy decoding has been over time found to be undesirably sub-optimal.
",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"Beam Search Beam search keeps K > 1 hypotheses, unlike greedy decoding which keeps only a single hypothesis during decoding.",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"At each time step t, beam search picks K hypotheses with the highest scores ( ∏t t′=1 p(yt|y<t, X)).",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"When all the hypotheses terminate (outputting the end-of-thesentence symbol), it returns the hypothesis with the highest log-probability.",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"Despite its superior performance compared to greedy decoding, the computational complexity grows linearly w.r.t.",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"the size of beam K, which makes it less preferable especially in the production environment.",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"Although we have described decoding in neural machine translation as a maximum-a-posteriori estimation in log p(Y |X), this is not necessarily the only nor the desirable decoding objective.
",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"First, each potential scenario in which neural machine translation is used calls for a unique decoding objective.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"In simultaneous translation/interpretation, which has recently been studied in the context of neural machine translation (Gu et al., 2016), the decoding objective is formulated as a trade-off between the translation quality and delay.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, when a machine translation system is used as a part of a larger information
extraction system, it is more important to correctly translate named entities and events than to translate syntactic function words.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"The decoding objective in this case must account for how the translation is used in subsequent modules in a larger system.
",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"Second, the conditional probability assigned by a trained neural machine translation model does not necessarily reflect our perception of translation quality.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"Although Cho (2016) provided empirical evidence of high correlation between the logprobability and BLEU, a de facto standard metric in machine translation, there have also been reports on large mismatch between the log-probability and BLEU.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"For instance, Tu et al. (2016a) showed that beam search with a very large beam, which is supposed to find translations with better logprobabilities, suffers from pathological translations of very short length, resulting in low translation quality.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"This calls for a way to design or learn a decoding algorithm with an objective that is more directly correlated to translation quality.
",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"In short, there is a significant need for designing multiple decoding algorithms for neural machine translation, regardless of how it was trained.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
It is however non-trivial to manually design a new decoding algorithm with an arbitrary objective.,3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"This is especially true with neural machine translation, as the underlying structure of the decoding/search process – the high-dimensional hidden state of a recurrent network – is accessible but not interpretable.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"Instead, in the remainder of this section, we propose our approach of trainable greedy decoding.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"We start from the noisy, parallel approximate decoding (NPAD) algorithm proposed in (Cho, 2016).",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
The main idea behind NPAD algorithm is that a better translation with a higher log-probability may be found by injecting unstructured noise in the transition function of a recurrent network.,3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
"That is,
zt = f(zt−1 + t, yt−1, et(X; θe); θf ),
where t ∼ N (0, (σ0/t)2).",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
NPAD avoids potential degradation of translation quality by running such a noisy greedy decoding process multiple times in parallel.,3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
"An important lesson of NPAD algorithm is that there exists a decoding strategy with the asymptotically same computational complexity that results in a better translation quality, and that such a better translation can be found by manipulating the hidden state of the recurrent network.
",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
"In this work, we propose to significantly extend NPAD by replacing the unstructured noise t with a parametric function approximator, or an agent, πφ.",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
"This agent takes as input the previous hidden state zt−1, previously decoded word ŷt−1 and the time-dependent context vector et(X; θe) and outputs a real-valued vectorial action at ∈ Rdim(zt).",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
"Such an agent is trained such that greedy decoding with the agent finds a translation that maximizes any predefined, arbitrary decoding objective, while the underlying neural machine translation model is pretrained and fixed.",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
"Once the agent is trained, we generate a translation given a source sentence by greedy decoding however augmented with this agent.",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
"We call this decoding strategy trainable greedy decoding.

"First, the decoding objective R may not be differentiable with respect to the agent.",3.3 Learning and Challenges,[0],[0]

"For instance, BLEU, a standard
quality metric in machine translation, is a piecewise linear function with zero derivatives almost everywhere.",3.3 Learning and Challenges,[0],[0]
"Second, the agent here is a real-valued, deterministic policy with a very high-dimensional action space (1000s of dimensions), which is well known to be difficult.",3.3 Learning and Challenges,[0],[0]
"In order to alleviate these difficulties, we propose to use a variant of the deterministic policy gradient algorithm (Silver et al., 2014; Lillicrap et al., 2015).",3.3 Learning and Challenges,[0],[0]

"This issue has however turned out to be less of a problem than in a usual reinforcement learning setting, as the state and action spaces are well structured thanks to pretraining by maximum likelihood learning.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"As observed by Cho (2016), any reasonable perturbation to the hidden state of the recurrent network generates a reasonable translation which would re-
ceive again a reasonable return.
",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"Although this property of dense reward makes the problem of trainable greedy decoding more manageable, we have observed other issues during our preliminary experiment with the vanilla deterministic policy gradient.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"In order to avoid these issues that caused instability, we propose the following modifications to the vanilla algorithm.
",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"Critic-Aware Actor Learning A major goal of the critic is not to estimate the return of a given episode, but to estimate the gradient of the return evaluated given an episode.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"In order to do so, the critic must be trained, or presented, with stateaction sequences z1:T ′ similar though not identical to the state-action sequence generated by the current actor π.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"This is achieved, in our case, by injecting unstructured noise to the action at each
time step, similar to (Heess et al., 2015):
ãt = φ(zt, at−1) + σ · , (2)
where is a zero-mean, unit-variance normal variable.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"This noise injection procedure is mainly used when training the critic.
",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
We have however observed that the quality of the reward and its gradient estimate of the critic is very noisy even when the critic was trained with this kind of noisy actor.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
This imperfection of the critic often led to the instability in training the actor in our preliminary experiments.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"In order to avoid this, we describe here a technique which we refer to as critic-aware actor gradient estimation.
",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"Instead of using the point estimate ∂R c
∂φ of the gradient of the predicted objective with respect to the actor’s parameters φ, we propose to use the expected gradient of the predicted objective with
respect to the critic-aware distribution Q.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"That is,
EQ [ ∂Rcψ ∂φ ] , (3)
where we define the critic-aware distribution Q as

",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"This expectation allows us to incorporate the noisy, non-uniform nature of the critic’s approximation of the objective by up-weighting the gradient computed at a point with a higher critic quality and down-weighting the gradient computed at a point with a lower critic quality.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"The first term in Q reflects this, while the second term ensures that our estimation is based on a small region around the state-action sequence generated by the current, noise-free actor π.
",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
Since it is intractable to compute Eq.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"(3) exactly, we resort to importance sampling with the proposed distribution equal to the second term in Eq.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
(4).,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"Then, our gradient estimate for the actor becomes the sum of the gradients from multiple realizations of the noisy actor in Eq.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"(2), where each gradient is weighted by the quality of the critic exp(−(Rcφ − R)2/τ).",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
τ is a hyperparameter that controls the smoothness of the weights.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"We observed in our preliminary experiment that the use of this criticaware actor learning significantly stabilizes general learning of both the actor and critic.
",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"Reference Translations for Training the Critic In our setting of neural machine translation, we have access to a reference translation for each source sentence X , unlike in a usual setting of reinforcement learning.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"By force-feeding the reference translation into the underlying neural machine translation system (rather than feeding the decoded symbols), we can generate the reference state-action sequence.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"This sequence is much less correlated with those sequences generated by the actor, and facilitates computing a better estimate of the gradient w.r.t.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]

"In Alg. 1, we present the complete algorithm.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"To make the description less cluttered, we only show the version of minibatch size = 1 which can be naturally extended.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
We also illustrate the proposed trainable greedy decoding and the proposed learning strategy in Fig. 1.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]
"We empirically evaluate the proposed trainable greedy decoding on four language pairs – EnDe, En-Ru, En-Cs and En-Fi – using a standard attention-based neural machine translation system (Bahdanau et al., 2014).",5 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
We train underlying neural translation systems using the parallel corpora made available from WMT’15.1 The same set of corpora are used for trainable greedy decoding as well.,5 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"All the corpora are tokenized and segmented into subword symbols using byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015).",5 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
We use sentences of length up to 50 subword symbols for MLE training and 200 symbols for trainable decoding.,5 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"For validation and testing, we use newstest-2013 and newstest-2015, respectively.",5 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"Underlying NMT Model For each language pair, we implement an attention-based neural machine translation model whose encoder and decoder recurrent networks have 1,028 gated recurrent units (GRU, Cho et al., 2014) each.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Source and target symbols are projected into 512-dimensional embedding vectors.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"We trained each model for approximately 1.5 weeks using Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012).
",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Actor π,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
We use a feedforward network with a single hidden layer as the actor.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"The input is a 2,056-dimensional vector which is the concatenation of the decoder hidden state and the timedependent context vector from the attention mech-
1http://www.statmt.org/wmt15/
anism, and it outputs a 1,028-dimensional action vector for the decoder.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"We use 32 units for the hidden layer with tanh activations.
",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Critic Rc The critic is implemented as a variant of an attention-based neural machine translation model that takes a reference translation as a source sentence and a state-action sequence from the actor as a target sentence.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Both the size of GRU units and embedding vectors are the same with the underlying model.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"Unlike a usual neural machine translation system, the critic does not language-model the target sentence but simply outputs a scalar value to predict the true return.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"When we predict a bounded return, such as sentence BLEU, we use a sigmoid activation at the output.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"For other unbounded return like perplexity, we use a linear activation.
",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Learning We train the actor and critic simultaneously by alternating between updating the actor and critic.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"As the quality of the critic’s approximation of the decoding objective has direct influence on the actor’s learning, we make ten updates to the critic before each time we update the actor once.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"We use RMSProp (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012) with the initial learning rates of 2× 10−6 and 2× 10−4, respectively, for the actor and critic.
",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
We monitor the progress of learning by measuring the decoding objective on the validation set.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"After training, we pick the actor that results in the best decoding objective on the validation set, and test it on the test set.
",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"Decoding Objectives For each neural machine translation model, pretrained using maximum likelihood criterion, we train two trainable greedy decoding actors.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"One actor is trained to maximize BLEU (or its smoothed version for sentence-level
scoring (Lin and Och, 2004))",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"as its decoding objective, and the other to minimize perplexity (or equivalently the negative log-probability normalized by the length.)
",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
We have chosen the first two decoding objectives for two purposes.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"First, we demonstrate that it is possible to build multiple trainable decoders with a single underlying model trained using maximum likelihood learning.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"Second, the comparison between these two objectives provides a glimpse into the relationship between BLEU (the most widely used automatic metric for evaluating translation systems) and log-likelihood (the most widely used learning criterion for neural machine translation).
",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Evaluation We test the trainable greedy decoder with both greedy decoding and beam search.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"Although our decoder is always trained with greedy decoding, beam search in practice can be used together with the actor of the trainable greedy decoder.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Beam search is expected to work better especially when our training of the trainable greedy decoder is unlikely to be optimal.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"In both cases, we report both the perplexity and BLEU.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
We present the improvements of BLEU and perplexity (or its negation) in Fig. 2 for all the language pair-directions.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
It is clear from these plots that the best result is achieved when the trainable greedy decoder was trained to maximize the target decoding objective.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"When the decoder was trained to maximize sentence-level BLEU, we see the improvement in BLEU but often the degradation in the perplexity (see the left plots in Fig. 2.)",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, when the actor was trained to minimize the perplexity, we only see the improvement in per-
plexity (see the right plots in Fig. 2.)",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This confirms our earlier claim that it is necessary and desirable to tune for the target decoding objective regardless of what the underlying translation system was trained for, and strongly supports the proposed idea of trainable decoding.
",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0.9532761559789105],['It shows that the integration of target information into the word-level representations is crucial for good performance.']
"The improvement from using the proposed trainable greedy decoding is smaller when used together with beam search, as seen in Fig. 2 (b).",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"However, we still observe statistically significant improvement in terms of BLEU (marked with red stars.)",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This suggests a future direction in which we extend the proposed trainable greedy decoding to directly incorporate beam search into its training procedure to further improve the translation quality.
",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
It is worthwhile to note that we achieved all of these improvements with negligible computational overhead.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This is due to the fact that our actor is a very small, shallow neural network, and that the more complicated critic is thrown away after training.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
We suspect the effectiveness of such a small actor is due to the well-structured hidden state space of the underlying neural machine translation model which was trained with a large amount of parallel corpus.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We believe this favourable computational complexity makes the proposed method suitable for production-grade neural machine translation (Wu et al., 2016; Crego et al., 2016).
",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Importance of Critic-Aware Actor Learning In Fig. 3, we show sample learning curves with and without the proposed critic-aware actor learning.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Both curves were from the models trained under the same condition.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Despite a slower start in the early stage of learning, we see that the critic-aware actor learning has greatly stabilized the learning progress.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We emphasize that we would not have been able to train all these 16 actors without the proposed critic-aware actor learning.
",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Examples In Fig. 4, we present three examples from Ru-En.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We defined the influence as the KL divergence between the conditional distributions without the trainable greedy decoding and with the trainable greedy decoding, assuming the fixed previous hidden state and target symbol.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We colored a target word with magenta, when the influence of the trainable greedy decoding is large (> 0.001).",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Manual inspection of these examples as well as others has revealed that the trainable greedy decoder focuses on fixing prepositions and removing any unnecessary symbol generation.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"More in-depth
analysis is however left as future work.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]

"The standard protocol for obtaining a labeled dataset is to have a human annotator view each example, assess its relevance, and provide a label (e.g., positive or negative for binary classification).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this only provides one bit of information per example.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This invites the question: how can we get more information per example, given that the annotator has already spent the effort reading and understanding an example?
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Previous works have relied on identifying relevant parts of the input such as labeling features (Druck et al., 2009; Raghavan et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2009), highlighting rationale phrases in
text (Zaidan and Eisner, 2008; Arora and Nyberg, 2009), or marking relevant regions in images (Ahn et al., 2006).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But there are certain types of information which cannot be easily reduced to annotating a portion of the input, such as the absence of a certain word, or the presence of at least two words.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we tap into the power of natural language and allow annotators to provide supervision to a classifier via natural language explanations.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we propose a framework in which annotators provide a natural language explanation for each label they assign to an example (see Figure 1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These explanations are parsed into logical forms representing labeling functions (LFs), functions that heuristically map examples to labels (Ratner et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The labeling functions are
then executed on many unlabeled examples, resulting in a large, weakly-supervised training set that is then used to train a classifier.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Semantic parsing of natural language into logical forms is recognized as a challenging problem and has been studied extensively (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Liang et al., 2011; Liang, 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One of our major findings is that in our setting, even a simple rule-based semantic parser suffices for three reasons: First, we find that the majority of incorrect LFs can be automatically filtered out either semantically (e.g., is it consistent with the associated example?) or pragmatically (e.g., does it avoid assigning the same label to the entire training set?).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, LFs near the gold LF in the space of logical forms are often just as accurate (and sometimes even more accurate).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Third, techniques for combining weak supervision sources are built to tolerate some noise (Alfonseca et al., 2012; Takamatsu et al., 2012; Ratner et al., 2018).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The significance of this is that we can deploy the same semantic parser across tasks without task-specific training.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show how we can tackle a real-world biomedical application with the same semantic parser used to extract instances of spouses.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our work is most similar to that of Srivastava et al. (2017), who also use natural language explanations to train a classifier, but with two important differences.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, they jointly train a task-specific semantic parser and classifier, whereas we use a
simple rule-based parser.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 4, we find that in our weak supervision framework, the rule-based semantic parser and the perfect parser yield nearly identical downstream performance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, while they use the logical forms of explanations to produce features that are fed directly to a classifier, we use them as functions for labeling a much larger training set.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Section 4, we show that using functions yields a 9.5 F1 improvement (26% relative improvement) over features, and that the F1 score scales with the amount of available unlabeled data.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We validate our approach on two existing datasets from the literature (extracting spouses from news articles and disease-causing chemicals from biomedical abstracts) and one real-world use case with our biomedical collaborators at OccamzRazor to extract protein-kinase interactions related to Parkinson’s disease from text.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We find empirically that users are able to train classifiers with comparable F1 scores up to two orders of magnitude faster when they provide natural language explanations instead of individual labels.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"The BabbleLabble Framework
The BabbleLabble framework converts natural language explanations and unlabeled data into a noisily-labeled training set (see Figure 2).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"There are three key components: a semantic parser, a filter bank, and a label aggregator.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The semantic
parser converts natural language explanations into a set of logical forms representing labeling functions (LFs).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The filter bank removes as many incorrect LFs as possible without requiring ground truth labels.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The remaining LFs are applied to unlabeled examples to produce a matrix of labels.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This label matrix is passed into the label aggregator, which combines these potentially conflicting and overlapping labels into one label for each example.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The resulting labeled examples are then used to train an arbitrary discriminative model.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To create the input explanations, the user views a subset S of an unlabeled dataset D (where |S| |D|) and provides for each input xi ∈ S a label yi and a natural language explanation ei, a sentence explaining why the example should receive that label.",2.1 Explanations,[0],[0]
"The explanation ei generally refers to specific aspects of the example (e.g., in Figure 2, the location of a specific string “his wife”).",2.1 Explanations,[0],[0]
"The semantic parser takes a natural language explanation ei and returns a set of LFs (logical forms or labeling functions) {f1, . . .",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
", fk} of the form fi : X → {−1, 0, 1} in a binary classification setting, with 0 representing abstention.",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"We emphasize that the goal of this semantic parser is not to generate the single correct parse, but rather to have coverage over many potentially useful LFs.1
1Indeed, we find empirically that an incorrect LF nearby the correct one in the space of logical forms actually has higher end-task accuracy 57% of the time (see Section 4.2).
",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
We choose a simple rule-based semantic parser that can be used without any training.,2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"Formally, the parser uses a set of rules of the form α → β, where α can be replaced by the token(s) in β (see Figure 3 for example rules).",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"To identify candidate LFs, we recursively construct a set of valid parses for each span of the explanation, based on the substitutions defined by the grammar rules.",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"At the end, the parser returns all valid parses (LFs in our case) corresponding to the entire explanation.
",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
We also allow an arbitrary number of tokens in a given span to be ignored when looking for a matching rule.,2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"This improves the ability of the parser to handle unexpected input, such as unknown words or typos, since the portions of the input that are parseable can still result in a valid parse.",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"For example, in Figure 3, the word “person” is ignored.
",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"All predicates included in our grammar (summarized in Table 1) are provided to annotators, with minimal examples of each in use (Appendix A).",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"Importantly, all rules are domain independent (e.g., all three relation extraction tasks that we tested used the same grammar), making the semantic parser easily transferrable to new domains.",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"Additionally, while this paper focuses on the task of relation extraction, in principle the BabbleLabble framework can be applied to other tasks or settings by extending the grammar with the necessary primitives (e.g., adding primitives for rows and columns to enable explanations about the alignments of words in tables).",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
"To guide the construction of the grammar, we collected 500 explanations for the Spouse domain from workers
on Amazon Mechanical Turk and added support for the most commonly used predicates.",2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
These were added before the experiments described in Section 4.,2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
Altogether the grammar contains 200 rule templates.,2.2 Semantic Parser,[0],[0]
The input to the filter bank is a set of candidate LFs produced by the semantic parser.,2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
The purpose of the filter bank is to discard as many incorrect LFs as possible without requiring additional labels.,2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"It consists of two classes of filters: semantic and pragmatic.
",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"Recall that each explanation ei is collected in the context of a specific labeled example (xi, yi).",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"The semantic filter checks for LFs that are inconsistent with their corresponding example; formally, any LF f for which f(xi) 6=",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
yi is discarded.,2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"For example, in the first explanation in Figure 2, the word “right” can be interpreted as either “immediately” (as in “right before”) or simply “to the
right.”",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"The latter interpretation results in a function that is inconsistent with the associated example (since “his wife” is actually to the left of person 2), so it can be safely removed.
",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"The pragmatic filters removes LFs that are constant, redundant, or correlated.",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"For example, in Figure 2, LF 2a is constant, as it labels every example positively (since all examples contain two people from the same sentence).",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"LF 3b is redundant, since even though it has a different syntax tree from LF 3a, it labels the training set identically and therefore provides no new signal.
",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"Finally, out of all LFs from the same explanation that pass all the other filters, we keep only the most specific (lowest coverage) LF.",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"This prevents multiple correlated LFs from a single example from dominating.
",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
"As we show in Section 4, over three tasks, the filter bank removes 86% of incorrect parses, and the incorrect ones that remain have average endtask accuracy within 2.5% of the corresponding correct parses.",2.3 Filter Bank,[0],[0]
The label aggregator combines multiple (potentially conflicting) suggested labels from the LFs and combines them into a single probabilistic label per example.,2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"Concretely, if m LFs pass the filter bank and are applied to n examples, the label aggregator implements a function f : {−1, 0, 1}m×n",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"→ [0, 1]n.
",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"A naive solution would be to use a simple majority vote, but this fails to account for the fact that LFs can vary widely in accuracy and coverage.",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"Instead, we use data programming (Ratner et al., 2016), which models the relationship between the true labels and the output of the labeling functions as a factor graph.",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"More specifically, given the true labels Y ∈ {−1, 1}n (latent) and label matrix Λ ∈ {−1, 0, 1}m×n (observed) where Λi,j = LFi(xj), we define two types of factors representing labeling propensity and accuracy:
φLabi,j (Λ, Y ) = 1{Λi,j 6= 0} (1) φAcci,j (Λ, Y ) = 1{Λi,j = yj}.",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"(2)
Denoting the vector of factors pertaining to a given data point xj as φj(Λ, Y ) ∈ Rm, define the model:
pw(Λ, Y )",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
= Z −1 w exp,2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"( n∑ j=1 w · φj(Λ, Y ) )",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
", (3)
where w ∈ R2m is the weight vector and Zw is the normalization constant.",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"To learn this model without knowing the true labels Y , we minimize the negative log marginal likelihood given the observed labels Λ:
ŵ = arg min w − log ∑ Y pw(Λ, Y ) (4)
using SGD and Gibbs sampling for inference, and then use the marginals pŵ(Y | Λ) as probabilistic training labels.
",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, we infer accuracies of the LFs based on the way they overlap and conflict with one another.",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
"Since noisier LFs are more likely to have high conflict rates with others, their corresponding accuracy weights in w will be smaller, reducing their influence on the aggregated labels.",2.4 Label Aggregator,[0],[0]
The noisily-labeled training set that the label aggregator outputs is used to train an arbitrary discriminative model.,2.5 Discriminative Model,[0],[0]
One advantage of training a discriminative model on the task instead of using the label aggregator as a classifier directly is that the label aggregator only takes into account those signals included in the LFs.,2.5 Discriminative Model,[0],[0]
"A discriminative model, on the other hand, can incorporate features that were not identified by the user but are nevertheless informative.2 Consequently, even examples for which all LFs abstained can still be classified correctly.",2.5 Discriminative Model,[0],[0]
"On the three tasks we evaluate, using the discriminative model averages 4.3 F1 points higher than using the label aggregator directly.
",2.5 Discriminative Model,[0],[0]
"For the results reported in this paper, our discriminative model is a simple logistic regression classifier with generic features defined over dependency paths.3 These features include unigrams,
2We give an example of two such features in Section 4.3.",2.5 Discriminative Model,[0],[0]

",3.2 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
Hyperparameters for all methods we report were selected via random search over thirty configurations on the same held-out development set.,3.2 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"We searched over learning rate, batch size, L2 regularization, and the subsampling rate (for improving balance between classes).6 All reported F1 scores are the average value of 40 runs with random seeds and otherwise identical settings.",3.2 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]
"We evaluate the performance of BabbleLabble with respect to its rate of improvement by number of user inputs, its dependence on correctly parsed logical forms, and the mechanism by which it utilizes logical forms.",4 Experimental Results,[0],[0]
In Table 3 we report the average F1 score of a classifier trained with BabbleLabble using 30 explanations or traditional supervision with the indicated number of labels.,4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
"On average, it took the same amount of time to collect 30 explanations as 60 labels.7 We observe that in all three tasks, BabbleLabble achieves a given F1 score with far fewer user inputs than traditional supervision, by

as much as 100 times in the case of the Spouse task.",4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
"Because explanations are applied to many unlabeled examples, each individual input from the user can implicitly contribute many (noisy) labels to the learning algorithm.
",4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
"We also observe, however, that once the number of labeled examples is sufficiently large, traditional supervision once again dominates, since ground truth labels are preferable to noisy ones generated by labeling functions.",4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
"However, in domains where there is much more unlabeled data available than labeled data (which in our experience is most domains), we can gain in supervision efficiency from using BabbleLabble.
",4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
"Of those explanations that did not produce a correct LF, 4% were caused by the explanation referring to unsupported concepts (e.g., one explanation referred to “the subject of the sentence,” which our simple parser doesn’t support).",4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
Another 2% were caused by human errors (the correct LF for the explanation was inconsistent with the example).,4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
"The remainder were due to unrecognized paraphrases (e.g., the explanation said “the order of appearance is X, Y” instead of a supported phrasing like “X comes before Y”).",4.1 High Bandwidth Supervision,[0],[0]
"In Table 4, we report LF summary statistics before and after filtering.",4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
LF correctness is based on exact match with a manually generated parse for each explanation.,4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
"Surprisingly, the simple heuristic-based filter bank successfully removes over 95% of incorrect LFs in all three tasks, resulting in final LF sets that are 86% correct on average.",4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, among those LFs that pass through the filter bank, we found that the average difference in end-task accuracy between correct and incorrect parses is less than 2.5%.",4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, the filters are effective because it is quite difficult for an LF to be parsed from the explana-
tion, label its own example correctly (passing the semantic filter), and not label all examples in the training set with the same label or identically to another LF (passing the pragmatic filter).
",4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
"We went one step further: using the LFs that would be produced by a perfect semantic parser as starting points, we searched for “nearby” LFs (LFs differing by only one predicate) with higher endtask accuracy on the test set and succeeded 57% of the time (see Figure 5 for an example).",4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
"In other words, when users provide explanations, the signals they describe provide good starting points, but they are actually unlikely to be optimal.",4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
"This observation is further supported by Table 5, which shows that the filter bank is necessary to remove clearly irrelevant LFs, but with that in place, the simple rule-based semantic parser and a perfect parser have nearly identical average F1 scores.",4.2 Utility of Incorrect Parses,[0],[0]
"Once we have relevant logical forms from userprovided explanations, we have multiple options for how to use them.",4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
Srivastava et al. (2017) propose using these logical forms as features in a linear classifier.,4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
"We choose instead to use them as functions for weakly supervising the creation of a larger training set via data programming (Ratner et al., 2016).",4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
"In Table 6, we compare the two approaches directly, finding that the the data programming approach outperforms a feature-based one by 9.5 F1 points with the rule-based parser, and by 4.5 points with a perfect parser.
",4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
We attribute this difference primarily to the ability of data programming to utilize unlabeled data.,4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
"In Figure 6, we show how the data programming approach improves with the number of unlabeled examples, even as the number of LFs remains constant.",4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
We also observe qualitatively that data programming exposes the classifier to additional patterns that are correlated with our explanations but not mentioned directly.,4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
"For example, in the Disease task, two of the features weighted most
highly by the discriminative model were the presence of the trigrams “could produce a” or “support diagnosis of” between the chemical and disease, despite none of these words occurring in the explanations for that task.",4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
In Table 6 we see a 4.3 F1 point improvement (10%) when we use the discriminative model that can take advantage of these features rather than applying the LFs directly to the test set and making predictions based on the output of the label aggregator.,4.3 Using LFs as Functions or Features,[0],[0]
Our work has two themes: modeling natural language explanations/instructions and learning from weak supervision.,5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
The closest body of work is on “learning from natural language.”,5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"As mentioned earlier, Srivastava et al. (2017) convert natural language explanations into classifier features (whereas we convert them into labeling functions).",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Goldwasser and Roth (2011) convert natural lan-
guage into concepts (e.g., the rules of a card game).",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
Ling and Fidler (2017) use natural language explanations to assist in supervising an image captioning model.,5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
Weston (2016); Li et al. (2016) learn from natural language feedback in a dialogue.,5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Wang et al. (2017) convert natural language definitions to rules in a semantic parser to build up progressively higher-level concepts.
",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"We lean on the formalism of semantic parsing (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Liang, 2016).",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"One notable trend is to learn semantic parsers from weak supervision (Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011), whereas our goal is to obtain weak supervision signal from semantic parsers.
",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
The broader topic of weak supervision has received much attention; we mention some works most related to relation extraction.,5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"In distant supervision (Craven et al., 1999; Mintz et al., 2009) and multi-instance learning (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), an existing knowledge base is used to (probabilistically) impute a training set.",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Various extensions have focused on aggregating a variety of supervision sources by learning generative models from noisy labels (Alfonseca et al., 2012; Takamatsu et al., 2012; Roth and Klakow, 2013; Ratner et al., 2016; Varma et al., 2017).
",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"Finally, while we have used natural language explanations as input to train models, they can also be output to interpret models (Krening et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2016).",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"More generally, from a machine learning perspective, labels are the primary asset, but they are a low bandwidth signal between annotators and the learning algorithm.",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
Natural language opens up a much higher-bandwidth communication channel.,5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]
"We have shown promising results in relation extraction (where one explanation can be “worth” 100 labels), and it would be interesting to extend our framework to other tasks and more interactive settings.",5 Related Work and Discussion,[0],[0]

"End-to-end dialogue systems, based on neural architectures like bidirectional LSTMs or Memory Networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) trained directly by gradient descent on dialogue logs, have been showing promising performance in multiple contexts (Wen et al., 2016; Serban et al., 2016; Bordes et al., 2016).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
One of their main advantages is that they can rely on large data sources of existing dialogues to learn to cover various domains without requiring any expert knowledge.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the flip side is that they also exhibit limited engagement, especially in chit-chat settings: they lack consistency and do not leverage proactive engagement strategies as (even partially) scripted chatbots do.
Zhang et al. (2018) introduced the PERSONACHAT dataset as a solution to cope with this issue.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"This paves the way to potentially end-to-end personalized chatbots because the personas of the bots, by being short texts, could be easily edited by most users.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, the PERSONA-CHAT dataset was created using an artificial data collection mechanism based on Mechanical Turk.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"There may not always be such an obvious relationship between the two: the discussion topic may not be covered by the persona, a single user may write contradictory statements, and due to errors in the extraction process, some persona sentences may not represent a general trait of the user (e.g. I am feeling happy today).",3.2 Persona extraction,[0],[0]

We train by passing all the dot products through a softmax and maximizing the log-likelihood of the correct responses.,4.1 Architecture,[0],[0]

It relies on the same word embeddings as the context encoder and applies a linear layer on top of them.,4.3 Persona encoder,[0],[0]
"We then sum the representations across the sentence.
",4.3 Persona encoder,[0],[0]
We deliberately choose a simpler architecture than the other encoders for performance reasons as the number of personas encoded for each batch is an order of magnitude greater than the number of training examples.,4.3 Persona encoder,[0],[0]
Most personas are short sentences; we therefore expect a bag-of-words representation to encode them well.,4.3 Persona encoder,[0],[0]

"Structured prediction, or the task of predicting multiple inter-dependent variables, is important in many domains, including computer vision, computational biology and natural language processing.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, in sequence labelling, image segmentation, and parsing we are given input variables x, and must predict output variables y, where the number of possible y values are typically exponential in the number of variables that comprise it.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Not only does this sometimes give rise to computational difficulties, it also leads to statistical parameter estimation issues, where learning precise models requires large amounts of labeled training data.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In some cases, unsupervised learning from plentiful unlabeled data may provide helpful outputs (Daumé III, 2009; Ammar et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
But usually some form of more direct supervision is required to create a model truly useful to the task at hand.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
In the absence of abundant labeled data we may consider alternative forms of supervision.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, rather than providing labeled data instances, humans may more easily inject their
domain knowledge by providing “labels on features,” or “expectations” about correct outputs, as in generalized expectation criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2010), or by providing constraints, as in posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010) or constraint driven learning (Chang et al., 2007).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A major weakness of these methods, however, is that at training time inference must be done in the factor graph encompassing the union of the model’s factor graph and the expectation dependencies— often leading to prohibitively expensive inference.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, these methods cannot learn from nondecomposable domain knowledge, where the domain knowledge is not in a form of a set of labeled features or constraints.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"An easy way for humans to express domain knowledge is by writing a simple scalar scoring function that indicates preferences among choices for y given x. These human-coded functions may, for example, be based on arbitrary rule systems (or even Turing-complete programs) of the sort written by humans to solve problems before machine learning became so wide-spread.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In general, the human written domain knowledge functions are not expected to be perfect— most likely only examining a subset of features and not covering all cases.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus we are now faced with two challenges: (1) the domain knowledge functions have limited generalization; (2) the domain knowledge functions provide a ranking, but do not provide an inference (search) procedure.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper presents a new training method for structured prediction energy networks (SPENs) (Belanger and McCallum, 2016; Belanger et al., 2017) that aims to address both these challenges, yielding efficient inference for structured prediction, trained from human-coded domain knowledge plus unlabeled data, but not requiring any labeled data instances.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In SPENs, the factor graph that typically represents
130
output variable dependencies is replaced with a deep neural network that takes y and x as input and outputs a scalar energy score, but is able to learn much richer correlations than are typically captured in factor graphs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Inference in SPENs is performed by gradient descent in the energy, back-propagated to cause steps in a relaxed y space.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Whereas previous training procedures for SPENs used labeled data, here we train SPENs from only unlabeled data plus human-coded domain knowledge in the form of a scoring function.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We do so by building on SampleRank (Rohanimanesh et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2010), which enforces that the rank of two sampled ys according to the trained factor graph is consistent with their rank according to distance to the labeled, true y.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In our training method, pairs of y’s are obtained from successive steps of training-time gradient-descent inference on y; when their rank is not consistent with that of the domain knowledge function, we accordingly update the energy network parameters.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We demonstrate our method on a citation field extraction task, for which we learn a neural network (1) that generalizes beyond the original domain knowledge function, and (2) that provides efficient test-time inference by gradient descent.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In general, SPEN parameterizes an energy function Ew(y,x) using deep neural networks over output variables y as well as input variables x, where w denotes the neural network’s parameters.",2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
Belanger and McCallum (2016) separate the energy function into global and local terms.,2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
"The role of the local terms is to capture the dependency among input x and each individual output variable yi, while the global term aims to capture long-range dependencies among output variables.
",2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
Prediction in SPENs requires finding ŷ,2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]

argminy∈Y,2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
"Ew(y,x)",2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
for the given input x.,2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
This inference problem is solved using gradient descent.,2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
"However, the energy surface is non-convex, which prevents gradient descent inference from finding the exact structure ymin that globally minimizes the energy function.",2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
One approach to address this problem is to parameterize the energy function such that the SPEN is convex in the output variables y,2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
"(Amos et al., 2017), but this limits the representational power of SPENs.",2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
"Al-
though gradient descent inference does not guarantee an exact solution, it has successfully been used in several domains such as multi-label classification (Belanger and McCallum, 2016), imagesegmentation (Gygli et al., 2017), and semantic role labeling (Belanger et al., 2017).",2 Structured Prediction Energy Networks,[0],[0]
"Different methods have been introduced for training SPENs: margin-based training (Belanger and McCallum, 2016), end-to-end learning (Belanger et al., 2017), and value matching (Gygli et al., 2017).",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"Margin-based training enforces the energy of the ground truth structure to be lower than the energy of every incorrect structure by a margin, which is calculated as the Hamming loss between the two structures.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
End-to-end learning unrolls the energy minimization into a differentiable computation graph to output the predicted structure.,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
It then trains the model by directly minimizing the loss between the predicted and ground-truth structures.,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"Finally, the value matching approach trains SPENs such that the energy value matches the value of a given target function, such as the L2 distance between the ground-truth and predicted structures.
",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
All of these methods strongly depend on the existence of the ground truth values either as labeled data or as the value of a function applied to it.,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"While dependence of the margin-based and endto-end learning approaches on the labeled data is explicit, this dependency in the case of valuematching may not be obvious.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"In the absence of labeled data, we have to use the model’s predictions instead, for training.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"These predictions are often incorrect, especially at early stages of training.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"As a result, value-matching training is constrained to match the score of these predictions with the value of the energy function defined by SPEN.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"This requires matching several incorrect structures for a given input, which hinders gradient descent inference from finding the exact solution by introducing many local optima.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"To address this problem, we use a ranking objective similar to SampleRank",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"(Rohanimanesh et al., 2011) such that it preserves the optimum points of the score function.
",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"In general, if SPEN ranks every pair of output structures identical to the score function, the optimum points of the score function match those of SPEN.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"However, forcing the ranking constraint for every pair of output structures is not tractable, so
we need to approximate it by sampling some candidate pairs.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"Given a score function V (y,x), we are able to rank every two consecutive candidate structures based on their score values.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
Consider two candidate output structures y1 and y2 for the given input x.,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"We define yh and yl based on the score function as the following:
yh = argmax y∈{y1,y2} V (y,x),
yl = argmin y∈{y1,y2} V (y,x).",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]

We expect that these two structures have the same ranking with respect to Ew(.,x), which can be described as: α(V (yh,x)",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"− V (yl,x))",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]

Figure 1 shows a ranking violation for two structures y1 and y2 for a given x. The arrows indicate the direction of update over the energy surface.,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"Note that we ignore the dependence of y on w, which introduces approximation in the gradient of Eq. 2.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"For the supervised setting, Belanger et al. (2017) address this problem by unrolling the inference steps as an inference network and back-propagating through the inference network.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
We leave exploring similar approaches for rank-based training for future work.,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"To compute Eq. 2, we need to find configurations yi and yj such that both are candidate solutions for argminy∈Y Ew(y,x).",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"If not, the number of required samples would be exponential in |Y|.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"Since at test time we use gradient descent inference, a similar method is used for generating candidate structures: the trajectory of points in the inference mechanism is used as the set of possible candidates.",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
The idea of deterministic sampling from SPEN energy surface was first introduced by David Belanger (2017).,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
"We define the inference trajectory, T (x), as a sequence of output structures generated using projected gradient descent inference in order to find the minimum solution of Ew(.,x).

{y1, · · · ,ym}, where yt+1 = Py∈∆L(yt − η ∂∂yEw(yt,x)).",3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]
Py∈∆L projects the values of y onto the probability simplex ∆L overL values that each variable y can take.,3 Rank-Based Training of SPENs,[0],[0]

"To show the success of rank-based learning with indirect supervision, we conduct experiments on citation field extraction as an instance of structured prediction problems.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"The goal of citation field extraction is to segment citation text into its constituent parts such as Author, Title, Journal, Page, and Date.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"We used the Cora citation dataset (Seymore et al., 1999), which includes 100 labeled examples as the test set and another 100 labeled examples for the validation set.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"Our training data consists of 300 training examples from the Cora citation data set for which we dismiss the labels,
as well as another 700 unlabeled citations acquired across the web, which adds up to 1000 unlabeled data points.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
Each token can be labeled with one of 13 possible tags.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"We use fixed-length input data by padding all citation text to the maximum citation length in the dataset, which is 118 tokens.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"We report token-level accuracy measured on non-pad tokens.
",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
We provide the learning algorithm with a human written score function that takes the citation text and predicted tags as input.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
The score function then checks for violations of its rules and penalizes the predicted tags accordingly.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
Figure 2 shows examples of rules in the score function.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"Our complete score function consists of around 50 rules.
",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
We used two 2-layer neural networks with 1000 and 500 hidden nodes to parameterize the local and global energy functions of SPEN.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"We examine different α (Eq. 2) values of 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0, and setting α value to 2.0 has the best performance on the validation set.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"We use gradient descent inference with ten gradient descent steps and η = 0.1 for both training and test.
",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
We include the results of generalized expectation (GE) from Mann and McCallum (2010) that use the same dataset and setting.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"Our results show that R-SPEN achieves significantly better tokenlevel accuracy as compared to GE.
",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
We also compare R-SPEN with different inference algorithms that search using the score function to find the best configuration with maximum score.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
The results of these are listed in Table 1.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
Greedy search first randomly initializes the output tags and then iteratively replaces each assigned tag with a tag that results in the maximum score until the end of the citation is reached.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"This process is repeated until convergence, measured by no tag changing in an iteration.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"To avoid the effects of random initialization, this is repeated with varied number of random restarts, as reported in Table 1, where the best configuration is used in the scores reported.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"For the baseline that implements beam search, each citation is labeled by employing a beam search on the space of all tags for each token and their subsequent configurations, while keeping track of the best k configurations from one token to the next.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"This search is further augmented by restarting the search from the best k found after one complete search, for a total of 10 times and 10 random restarts.
",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"Consulting Table 1, we can confirm that both greedy search and beam search find much better output structures in term of score values as compared to R-SPEN; however, they achieve poor accuracy because the domain knowledge function does not comprehensively provide rules regarding all possible output structures.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
We report the average score values of the R-SPEN predictions on test data as a function of training iterations in Figure 3.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"Within 1000 iterations, R-SPEN is able to achieve a test set accuracy of 38%, outperforming all baselines, while the average score is -18.0.",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"R-SPEN generalizes beyond the domain knowledge function because it successfully captures the correlation among output variables through rank-based training on unlabeled data, so its predictions may have lower score values but are more accurate.
",4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
The test time inference of R-SPEN is much faster than search algorithms because SPEN provides efficient approximate inference.,4 Citation Field Extraction,[0],[0]
"Generalized Expectation (GE) (Mann and McCallum, 2010), Posterior Regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010) and Constraint Driven Learning (Chang et al., 2007) are among well-known approaches to learn from domain knowledge decomposed over a set of constraints or labeled features.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, these methods cannot learn from black box domain knowledge based score functions.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Score functions of this type are abundant in
various fields, for example, when the score is the result of evaluating a non-differentiable function over output structures.

Stewart and Ermon (2017) train a neural network using a score function that guides the training based on physics of moving objects.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
They have defined a differentiable score function which provides the learning algorithm with the gradient of the score function.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, in our approach the score function could be any complex non-differentiable function.

Peng et al. (2017) and Iyyer et al. (2017) use energy-based max-margin training for learning from an implicit source of supervision.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
This can be viewed as a score function evaluating the predicted output structure based on some real-world domain.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For example, if the output structure is the SQL query associated with a natural language question, the score function can be specified as the Jaccard similarity of the extracted cells from the table using the generated SQL query and the set of
gold answers for the natural language query as in Iyyer et al (2017).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
We have introduced a method to train structured prediction energy networks with indirect supervision that is derived from domain knowledge.,6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]

"Three key research issues in transfer learning, pointed by Pan & Yang, are when to transfer, how to transfer, and what to transfer.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Once transfer learning from a source domain is considered to benefit a target domain (when to transfer), an algorithm (how to transfer) discovers the transferable knowledge across domains (what to transfer).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Different algorithms are likely to discover different transferable knowledge, and thereby lead to uneven transfer learning effectiveness which is evaluated by the performance improvement over non-transfer baselines in a target domain.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To achieve the optimal performance improvement for a target domain given a source domain, researchers may try tens to hundreds of transfer learning algorithms covering instance (Dai et al., 2007), parameter (Tommasi et al., 2014), and feature (Pan et al., 2011) based algorithms.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Such bruteforce exploration is computationally expensive and practically impossible.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a tradeoff, a sub-optimal improvement is usually obtained from a heuristically selected algorithm, which unfortunately requires considerable expertise in an ad-hoc and unsystematic manner.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Exploring different algorithms is not the only way to optimize what to transfer.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Previous transfer learning experiences do also help, which has been widely accepted in educational psychology (Luria, 1976; Belmont et al., 1982).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Human beings sharpen transfer learning skills of deciding what to transfer by conducting meta-cognitive reflection on diverse transfer learning experiences.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, children who are good at playing chess may transfer mathematical skills, visuospatial skills, and decision making skills learned from chess to solve arithmetic problems, to solve pattern matching puzzles, and to play basketball, respectively.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"At a later age, it will be easier for them to decide to transfer mathematical and decision making skills learned from chess, rather than visuospatial skills, to market investment.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Unfortunately, all existing transfer learning algorithms transfer from scratch and ignore previous transfer learning experiences.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Motivated by this, we propose a novel transfer learning framework called Learning to Transfer (L2T).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The key idea of the L2T is to enhance the transfer learning effectiveness from a source to a target domain by leveraging previous
transfer learning experiences to optimize what and how to transfer between them.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"To achieve the goal, we establish the L2T in two stages.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"During the first stage, we encode each transfer learning experience into three components: a pair of source and target domains, the transferred knowledge between them parameterized as latent feature factors, and performance improvement.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
We learn from all experiences a reflection function which maps a pair of domains and the transferred knowledge between them to the performance improvement.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The reflection function, therefore, is believed to encrypt transfer learning skills of deciding what and how to transfer.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the second stage, what to transfer between a newly arrived pair of domains is optimized so that the value of the learned reflection function, matching to the performance improvement, is maximized.

The contribution of this paper lies in that we propose a novel transfer learning framework which opens a new door to improve transfer learning effectiveness by taking advantage of previous transfer learning experiences.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"Datasets We evaluate the L2T framework on two image datasets, Caltech-256 (Griffin et al., 2007) and Sketches (Eitz et al., 2012).",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Caltech-256, collected from Google Images, contains a total of 30,607 images in 256 categories.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]

"We construct each pair of source and target domains by randomly sampling three categories from Caltech-256 as the source domain and randomly sampling three categories from Sketches as the target domain, which we give an example in the supplementary material.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]

• Non-transfer: Original builds a model using labeled data in a target domain only.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"• Common latent space based transfer learning algorithms: TCA (Pan et al., 2011), ITL (Shi & Sha, 2012), CMF (Long et al., 2014), LSDT (Zhang et al., 2016), STL (Raina et al., 2007), DIP (Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013) and SIE (Baktashmotlagh et al., 2014).",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"• Manifold ensemble based algorithms: GFK (Gong et al., 2012).

The eight feature-based transfer learning algorithms also constitute the base set A.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Based on feature representations obtained by different algorithms, we use the nearestneighbor classifier to perform three-class classification for the target domain.
",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
One evaluation metric is classification accuracy on testing examples of a target domain.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, accuracies are incomparable for different target domains at different levels of difficulty.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The other evaluation metric we adopt is the performance improvement ratio defined in Section 3.1, so as to compare the L2T over different pairs of domains.

"Performance Comparison In this experiment, we learn a reflection function from 1,000 transfer learning experiences, and evaluate the reflection function on 500 testing pairs of source and target domains by comparing the average performance improvement ratio to the baselines.",5.

"As Figure 4 shows, on average the proposed L2T framework outperforms the baselines up to 10% when varying the number of labeled samples in the target domain.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As the number of labeled target examples increases from 3 to 120, the performance improvement ratio becomes smaller because the accuracy of Original without transfer tends to increase.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The baseline
algorithms behave differently.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The transferable knowledge learned by LSDT helps a target domain a lot when training examples are scarce, while GFK performs poorly until training examples become more.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
STL is almost the worst baseline because it learns a dictionary from the source domain only but ignores the target domain.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
It runs at a high risk of failure especially when two domains are distant.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"DIP and SIE, which minimize the MMD and Hellinger distance between domains subject to manifold constraints, are competent.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Note that we have run the paired t-test between L2T and each baseline with all the p-values in the order of 10−12, concluding that the L2T is significantly superior.

We also randomly select six of the 500 testing pairs and compare classification accuracies by different algorithms for each pair in Figure 3.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
The performance of all baselines varies from pair to pair.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Among all the baseline methods, TCA performs the best when transferring between domains in Figure 3a and LSDT is the most superior in Figure 3c.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"However, L2T consistently outperforms the baselines on all the settings.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"For some pairs, e.g., Figures 3a, 3c and 3f, the three classes in a target domain are comparably easy to tell apart, hence Original without transfer can achieve even better results than some transfer learning algorithms.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"In this case, L2T still improves by discovering the best transferable knowledge from the source domain, especially when the number of labeled examples is small (see Figure 3c and 3f).",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"If two domains are very related, e.g., the source with “galaxy” and “saturn” and the target with “sun” in Figure 3a, L2T even finds out more transferable knowledge and contributes more significant improvement.

"Varying the Experiences We further investigate how transfer learning experiences used to learn the reflection function influence the performance of L2T. In this experiment, we evaluate on 50 randomly sampled pairs out of the 500 testing pairs in order to efficiently investigate a wide range of cases in the following.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"The sampled set is unbiased and sufficient to characterize such influence, evidenced by the asymptotic consistency between the average performance improvement ratio on the 500 pairs in Figure 4 and that on the 50 pairs in the last line of Table 1.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"First, we fix the number of transfer learning experiences to be 1,000 and vary the set of base transfer learning algorithms.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
The results are shown in Table 1.,5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Even with experiences generated by single base algorithm, e.g., ITL or DIP, the L2T can still learn a reflection function that significantly better (p-value < 0.05) decides what to transfer than using ITL or DIP directly.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"With more base algorithms involved, the transfer learning experiences are more diverse to cover more situations of source-target pairs and the knowledge transferred between them.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As a result, the L2T learns a better reflection function and thereby achieves higher performance improvement ratios, which coincides with Theorem 2 where a larger r indicating more independence between experiences gives a tighter bound.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"Second, we fix the set of base algorithms to include all the eight baselines and vary the number of transfer learning experiences used for training.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 5, the average performance improvement ratio achieved by L2T tends to increase as the number of labeled examples in the target domain decreases, given that Original without transfer performs extremely poor with scarce labeled examples.

fer learning skills in the reflection function, achieve larger performance improvement ratios.",5. Experiments,[0],[0]

"Contrary to the previous attention-based approaches which apply the same target representation to determine the attention scores of individual context words, TST firstly generates different representations of the target conditioned on individual context words, then it consolidates each context word with its tailor-made target representation to obtain the transformed word representation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Considering the context word “long” and the target “battery life” in the above example, TST firstly measures the associations between “long” and individual target words.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Then it uses the association scores to generate the target representation conditioned on “long”.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"After that, TST transforms the representation of “long” into its target-specific version with the new target representation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Note that “long” could also indicate a negative sentiment (say for “startup time”), and the above TST is able to differentiate them.
