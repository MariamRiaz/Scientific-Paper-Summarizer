We consider learning a classifier from logged data.,1. Introduction,[1.0],['We consider learning a classifier from logged data.']
"Here, the learner has access to a logged labeled dataset that has been collected according to a known pre-determined policy, and his goal is to learn a classifier that predicts the labels accurately over the entire population, not just conditioned on the logging policy.

A major challenge in learning from logged data is that the logging policy may leave large areas of the data distribution under-explored.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Consequently, empirical risk minimization (ERM) on the logged data leads to classifiers that may be highly suboptimal on the population.",1. Introduction,[1.0],"['Consequently, empirical risk minimization (ERM) on the logged data leads to classifiers that may be highly suboptimal on the population.']"
"When the logging policy is known, a second option is to use a weighted ERM, that reweighs each observed labeled data point to ensure that it reflects the underlying population.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this may lead to sample inefficiency if the logging policy does not adequately explore essential regions of the population.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A final approach, typically used in clinical trials, is controlled random experimentation – essentially, ignore the logged data, and record outcomes for fresh examples drawn from the population.",1. Introduction,[1.0],"['A final approach, typically used in clinical trials, is controlled random experimentation – essentially, ignore the logged data, and record outcomes for fresh examples drawn from the population.']"

"Motivated by these challenges, we propose active learning to combine logged data with a small amount of strategically chosen labeled data that can be used to correct the bias in the logging policy.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This solution has the potential to achieve the best of both worlds by limiting experimentation to achieve higher sample efficiency, and by making the most of the logged data.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we assume that in addition to the logged data, the learner has some additional unlabeled data that he can selectively ask an annotator to label.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

How can we utilize logged data for better active learning?,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
This problem has not been studied to the best of our knowledge.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A naive approach is to use the logged data to come up with a warm start and then do standard active learning.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we show that we can do even better.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to the warm start, we show how to use multiple importance sampling estimators to utilize the logged data more efficiently.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Additionally, we introduce a novel debiasing policy that selectively avoids label queries for those examples that are highly represented in the logged data.
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Combining these three approaches, we provide a new algorithm.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We prove that our algorithm is statistically consistent, and has a lower label requirement than simple active learning that uses the logged data as a warm start.",1.

"Finally, we
evaluate our algorithm experimentally on various datasets and logging policies.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Our experiments show that the performance of our method is either the best or close to the best for a variety of datasets and logging policies.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]

Our algorithm applies a straightforward way of making use of the logged data T0 inside the DBAL framework: to set the initial candidate set V0 to be the set of classifiers that have a low empirical error on T0.
",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
KEY IDEA 2: MULTIPLE IMPORTANCE,3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"SAMPLING

",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
We remark that the main purpose of using multiple importance sampling estimators here is to control the variance due to the predetermined logging policy.,3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"In the classical active learning setting without logged data, standard impor-
tance sampling can give satisfactory performance guarantees (Beygelzimer et al., 2009; 2010; Huang et al., 2015).

"KEY IDEA 3: A DEBIASING QUERY STRATEGY
",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
The logging policy Q0 introduces bias into the logged data: some examples may be underrepresented since Q0 chooses to reveal their labels with lower probability.,3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
Our algorithm employs a debiasing query strategy to neutralize this effect.,3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"For any instance x in the online data, the algorithm would query for its label with a lower probability if Q0(x) is relatively large.
",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
It is clear that a lower query probability leads to fewer label queries.,3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we claim that our debiasing strategy, though queries for less labels, does not deteriorate our theoretical guarantee on the error rate of the final output classifier.",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"To see this, we note that we can establish a concentration bound for multiple importance sampling estimators that with probability at least 1− δ, for all h ∈ H,
l(h)− l(h?) ≤2(l(h, S)− l(h?, S))

(3)
where m,n are sizes of logged data and online data respectively, Q0 and Q1 are query policy during the logging phase and the online phase respectively, and γ1 is an absolute constant (see Corollary 15 in Appendix for proof).
",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"This concentration bound implies that for any x ∈ X , if Q0(x) is large, we can set Q1(x) to be relatively small (as long as mQ0(x) + nQ1(x) ≥ infx′ mQ0(x′) + nQ1(x′)) while achieving the same concentration bound.",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"Consequently, the upper bound on the final error rate that we can establish from this concentration bound would not be impacted by the debiasing querying strategy.
",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
One technical difficulty of applying both multiple importance sampling and the debiasing strategy to the DBAL framework is adaptivity.,3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
Applying both methods requires that the query policy and consequently the importance weights in the error estimator are updated with observed examples in each iteration.,3.1. Main Ideas,[1.0],['Applying both methods requires that the query policy and consequently the importance weights in the error estimator are updated with observed examples in each iteration.']
"In this case, the summands of the error estimator are not independent, and the estimator becomes an adaptive multiple importance sampling estimator whose convergence property is still an open problem (Cornuet et al., 2012).
",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"To circumvent this convergence issue and establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, in each iteration, we compute the error estimator from a fresh sample set.",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
"In particular, we partition the logged data and the online data stream into
disjoint subsets, and we use one logged subset and one online subset for each iteration.",3.1. Main Ideas,[0],[0]
