It plays an important role in statistical machine translation (SMT) as word-aligned bilingual corpora serve as the input of translation rule extraction (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).\nAlthough state-of-the-art generative alignment models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996) have been widely used in practical SMT systems, they fail to model the symmetry of word alignment. While word alignments in real-world bilingual data usually exhibit complicated mappings (i.e., mixed with one-to-one, one-to-many, manyto-one, and many-to-many links), these models assume that each target word is aligned to exactly\n\u2217Corresponding author: Yang Liu.\none source word. To alleviate this problem, heuristic methods (e.g., grow-diag-final) have been proposed to combine two asymmetric alignments (source-to-target and target-to-source) to generate symmetric bidirectional alignments (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn and Hoang, 2007).\nInstead of using heuristic symmetrization, Liang et al. (2006) introduce a principled approach that encourages the agreement between asymmetric alignments in two directions. The basic idea is to favor links on which both unidirectional models agree. They associate two models via the agreement constraint and show that agreement-based joint training improves alignment accuracy significantly.\nHowever, enforcing agreement in joint training faces a major problem: the two models are restricted to one-to-one alignments (Liang et al., 2006). This significantly limits the translation accuracy, especially for distantly-related language pairs such as Chinese-English (see Section 5). Although posterior decoding can potentially address this problem, Liang et al. (2006) find that many-to-many alignments occur infrequently because posteriors are sharply peaked around the Viterbi alignments. We believe that this happens because their model imposes a hard constraint on agreement: the two models must share the same alignment when estimating the parameters by calculating the products of alignment posteriors (see Section 2).\nIn this work, we propose a general framework for imposing agreement constraints in joint training of unidirectional models. The central idea is to use the expectation of a loss function, which measures the disagreement between two models, to replace the original probability of agreement. This allows for many possible ways to quantify agreement. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that our approach outperforms two state-ofthe-art baselines significantly.\n1828"}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Asymmetric Alignment Models", "text": "Given a source-language sentence e \u2261 eI1 = e1, . . . , eI and a target-language sentence f \u2261 fJ1 = f1, . . . , fJ , a source-to-target translation model (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996) can be defined as\nP (f |e; \u03b81) = \u2211 a1 P (f ,a1|e; \u03b81) (1)\nwhere a1 denotes the source-to-target alignment and \u03b81 is the set of source-to-target translation model parameters.\nLikewise, the target-to-source translation model is given by\nP (e|f ; \u03b82) = \u2211 a2 P (e,a2|f ; \u03b82) (2)\nwhere a2 denotes the target-to-source alignment and \u03b82 is the set of target-to-source translation model parameters.\nGiven a training set D = {\u3008f (s), e(s)\u3009}Ss=1, the two models are trained independently to maximize the log-likelihood of the training data for each direction, respectively:\nL(\u03b81) = S\u2211\ns=1\nlogP (f (s)|e(s); \u03b81) (3)\nL(\u03b82) = S\u2211\ns=1\nlogP (e(s)|f (s); \u03b82) (4)\nOne key limitation of these generative models is that they are asymmetric: each target word is restricted to be aligned to exactly one source word (including the empty cept) in the sourceto-target direction and vice versa. This is undesirable because most real-world word alignments are symmetric, in which one-to-one, oneto-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many links are usually mixed. See Figure 1(a) for example. Therefore, a number of heuristic symmetrization methods such as intersection, union, and growdiag-final have been proposed to combine asym-\nmetric alignments (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn and Hoang, 2007)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Alignment by Agreement", "text": "Rather than using heuristic symmetrization methods, Liang et al.

In Figure 1(b), the two oneto-one alignments are almost identical except for one link. This makes the posteriors to be sharply peaked around the Viterbi alignments (Liang et al., 2006).

Note that the union of the two asymmetric alignments is almost the same with the goldstandard alignment in this example.\nWhile there are many possible ways to define a soft matching loss function, we choose the difference between disagreed and agreed link counts because it is easy and efficient to calculate during search:\n\u2206SM(a1,a2) = |a1 \u222a a2| \u2212 2|a1 \u2229 a2| (10)\nCE EC"}, {"heading": "3.2 Agreement between Word Alignments and Phrase Segmentations", "text": "Our framework is very general and can be extended to include the agreement between word alignment and other latent structures such as phrase segmentations.\nThe words in a Chinese sentence often constitute phrases that are translated as units in English and vice versa. Inspired by the alignment consistency constraint widely used in translation rule extraction (Koehn et al., 2003), we make the following assumption to impose a structural agreement constraint between word alignment and phrase segmentation: source words in one source phrase should be aligned to target words belonging to the same target phrase and vice versa.\nFor example, consider the C\u2192 E alignment in Figure 2. We segment Chinese and English sentences into phrases, which are sequences of consecutive words. Since \u201c2002\u201d and \u201cAPEC\u201d belong to the same English phrase, their counterparts on the Chinese side should also belong to one phrase.\nWhile this assumption can potentially improve the correlation between word alignment and phrase-based translation, a question naturally arises: how to segment sentences into phrases? Instead of leveraging chunking, we treat phrase segmentation as a latent variable and train the\njoint alignment and segmentation model from unlabeled data in an unsupervised way.\nFormally, given a target-language sentence f \u2261 fJ1 = f1, . . . , fJ , we introduce a latent variable b \u2261 bJ1 = b1, . . . , bJ to denote a phrase segmentation. Each label bj \u2208 {B, I,E, S}, where B denotes the beginning word of a phrase, I denotes the internal word, E denotes the ending word, and S denotes the one-word phrase.

(2006) indicate that it is intractable to train the joint model. For simplicity and efficiency, they exploit a simple heuristic procedure that leverages the product of posterior marginal probabilities. The intuition behind the heuristic is that links on which two models disagree should be discounted because the products of the marginals are small (Liang et al., 2006).\nUnfortunately, it is hard to develop a similar heuristic for our model that allows for arbitrary loss functions. Alternatively, we resort to a Viterbi EM algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 1. The algorithm takes the training data D = {\u3008f (s), e(s)\u3009}Ss=1 as input (line 1). We use \u0398(k) = \u3008\u03b8(k)1 ,\u03b8(k)2 ,\u03bb(k)1 ,\u03bb(k)2 \u3009 to denote the set of model parameters at the k-th iteration. After initializing the model parameters (line 2), the algorithm alternates between searching for the Viterbi alignments\nand segmentations H\u0302(k) using the SEARCH procedure (line 4) and updating model parameters using the UPDATE procedure (line 5). The algorithm terminates after running for K iterations.\nIt is challenging to search for the Viterbi alignments and segmentations because of complicated structural dependencies. As shown in Algorithm 2, our strategy is first to find Viterbi alignments and segmentations independently using the ALIGN and SEGMENT procedures (lines 4-7), which then serve as a starting point for the HILLCLIMB procedure (lines 8-9).\nFigure 3 shows three operators we use in the HILLCLIMB procedure. The MOVE operator moves a link in an alignment, the MERGE operator merges two phrases into one phrase, and the SPLIT operator splits one phrase into two smaller phrases. Note that each operator can be further divided into two variants: one for the source side and another for the target side."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1 Setup", "text": "We evaluate our approach on Chinese-English alignment and translation tasks.\nThe training corpus consists of 1.2M sentence pairs with 32M Chinese words and 35.4M English words. We used the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train a 4-gram language model on the Xinhua portion of the English GIGAWORD corpus, which contains 398.6M words. For alignment evaluation, we used the Tsinghua Chinese-English\nword alignment evaluation data set.1 The evaluation metric is alignment error rate (AER) (Och and Ney, 2003). For translation evaluation, we used the NIST 2006 dataset as the development set and the NIST 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2008 datasets as the test sets. The evaluation metric is case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).\nWe used both phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003) and hierarchical phrase-based (Chiang, 2007) translation systems to evaluate whether our approach improves translation performance. For the phrase-based model, we used the open-source toolkit Moses (Koehn and Hoang, 2007). For the hierarchical phrase-based model, we used an inhouse re-implementation on par with state-of-theart open-source decoders.\nWe compared our approach with two state-ofthe-art generative alignment models:\n1.

The hyperparameter of posterior decoding was optimized on the development set.\nWe used first-order HMMs for both word alignment and phrase segmentation. Our joint alignment and segmentation model were trained using the Viterbi EM algorithm for five iterations.

We propose a general framework to allow for arbitrary loss functions that measure the disagreement between asymmetric alignments. The loss functions can not only be defined between asymmetric alignments but also between alignments and other latent structures such as phrase segmentations. We use a Viterbi EM algorithm to train the joint model since the inference is intractable. Experiments on ChineseEnglish translation show that joint training with generalized agreement achieves significant improvements over two state-ofthe-art alignment methods.", "title": "Generalized Agreement for Bidirectional Word Alignment"}
