These works explain the predictions in terms of the model, but how can we explain where the model came from?\nIn this paper, we tackle this question by tracing a model\u2019s predictions through its learning algorithm and back to the training data, where the model parameters ultimately derive from. To formalize the impact of a training point on a prediction, we ask the counterfactual: what would happen if we did not have this training point, or if the values of this training point were changed slightly?\nAnswering this question by perturbing the data and retraining the model can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this problem, we use influence functions, a classic technique from robust statistics (Hampel, 1974) that tells us how the model parameters change as we upweight a training point by an infinitesimal amount. This allows us to \u201cdifferentiate through the training\u201d to estimate in closed-form the effect of a variety of training perturbations.\nDespite their rich history in statistics, influence functions have not seen widespread use in machine learning; to the best of our knowledge, the work closest to ours is Wojnowicz et al. (2016), which introduced a method for approximating a quantity related to influence in generalized linear models. One obstacle to adoption is that influence functions require expensive second derivative calculations and assume model differentiability and convexity, which limits their applicability in modern contexts where models are often non-differentiable, non-convex, and highdimensional. We address these challenges by showing that we can efficiently approximate influence functions using second-order optimization techniques (Pearlmutter, 1994; Martens, 2010; Agarwal et al., 2016), and that they remain accurate even as the underlying assumptions of differentiability and convexity degrade.\nInfluence functions capture the core idea of studying models through the lens of their training data. We show that they are a versatile tool that can be applied to a wide variety of seemingly disparate tasks: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and creating visually-indistinguishable adversarial training examples that can flip neural network test predictions, the training set analogue of Goodfellow et al.

In essence, we are forming a quadratic approximation to the empirical risk around \u03b8\u0302 and take a single Newton step; see appendix A for a derivation. Since removing a point z is the same as upweighting it by = \u2212 1n , we can linearly approximate the parameter change due to removing z without retraining the model by computing \u03b8\u0302\u2212z \u2212 \u03b8\u0302 \u2248 \u2212 1nIup,params(z).\nNext, we apply the chain rule to measure how upweighting z changes functions of \u03b8\u0302.

Analogous equations also apply for changes in y. While influence functions might appear to only work for infinitesimal (therefore continuous) perturbations, it is important to note that this approximation holds for arbitrary \u03b4: the - upweighting scheme allows us to smoothly interpolate between z and z\u03b4 .

Second, the weighted covariance matrix H\u22121 \u03b8\u0302 measures the \u201cresistance\u201d of the other training points to the removal of z; if \u2207\u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0302) points in a direction of little variation, its influence will be higher since moving in that direction will not significantly increase the loss on other training points.

With n training points and \u03b8 \u2208 Rp, this requires O(np2 + p3) operations, which\nis too expensive for models like deep neural networks with millions of parameters. Second, we need to calculate Iup,loss(zi, ztest) across all training points zi.\nThe first problem is well-studied in second-order optimization. The idea is to avoid explicitly computing H\u22121\n\u03b8\u0302 ; in-\nstead, we use implicit Hessian-vector products (HVPs) to efficiently approximate stest def = H\u22121\n\u03b8\u0302 \u2207\u03b8L(ztest, \u03b8\u0302) and then\ncompute Iup,loss(z, ztest) = \u2212stest \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0302). This also solves the second problem: for each test point of interest, we can precompute stest and then efficiently compute \u2212stest \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302) for each training point zi.\nWe discuss two techniques for approximating stest, both relying on the fact that the HVP of a single term in H\u03b8\u0302, [\u22072\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302)]v, can be computed for arbitrary v in the same time that \u2207\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302) would take, which is typically O(p) (Pearlmutter, 1994).\nConjugate gradients (CG). The first technique is a standard transformation of matrix inversion into an optimization problem. Since H\u03b8\u0302 0 by assumption, H \u22121 \u03b8\u0302 v \u2261 arg mint{t>H\u03b8\u0302t \u2212 v >t}. We can solve this with CG approaches that only require the evaluation of H\u03b8\u0302t, which takesO(np) time, without explicitly formingH\u03b8\u0302. While an exact solution takes p CG iterations, in practice we can get a good approximation with fewer iterations; see Martens (2010) for more details.\nStochastic estimation. With large datasets, standard CG can be slow; each iteration still goes through all n training points. We use a method developed by Agarwal et al. (2016) to get an estimator that only samples a single point per iteration, which results in significant speedups.\nDropping the \u03b8\u0302 subscript for clarity, letH\u22121j def = \u2211j i=0(I\u2212 H)i, the first j terms in the Taylor expansion of H\u22121. Rewrite this recursively as H\u22121j = I + (I \u2212 H)H \u22121 j\u22121. From the validity of the Taylor expansion, H\u22121j \u2192 H\u22121 as j \u2192 \u221e.2 The key is that at each iteration, we can substitute the full H with a draw from any unbiased (and fasterto-compute) estimator of H to form H\u0303j . Since E[H\u0303\u22121j ] = H\u22121j , we still have E[H\u0303 \u22121 j ]\u2192 H\u22121.\nIn particular, we can use \u22072\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302), for any zi, as an unbiased estimator of H . This gives us the following procedure: uniformly sample t points zs1 , . . . , zst from the training data; define H\u0303\u221210 v = v; and recursively compute H\u0303\u22121j v = v + ( I \u2212 \u22072\u03b8L(zsj , \u03b8\u0302) ) H\u0303\u22121j\u22121v, taking H\u0303 \u22121 t v as our final unbiased estimate of H\u22121v. We pick t to be large enough such that H\u0303t stabilizes, and to reduce variance we repeat this procedure r times and average results. Empirically, we found this significantly faster than CG.\nWe note that the original method of Agarwal et al. (2016) dealt only with generalized linear models, for which [\u22072\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302)]v can be efficiently computed in O(p) time. In our case, we rely on Pearlmutter (1994)\u2019s more general algorithm for fast HVPs, described above, to achieve the same time complexity.3\nWith these techniques, we can compute Iup,loss(zi, ztest) on all training points zi in O(np + rtp) time; we show in Section 4.1 that empirically, choosing rt = O(n) gives accurate results. Similarly, we can compute Ipert,loss(zi, ztest) = \u2212 1n\u2207\u03b8L(ztest, \u03b8\u0302) >H\u22121 \u03b8\u0302 \u2207x\u2207\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302) with two matrix-vector products: we first compute stest, then find s>test\u2207x\u2207\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302) with the same HVP trick. These computations are easy to implement in auto-grad systems like TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015) and Theano (Theano D. Team, 2016), as users need only specify the loss; the rest is automatically handled."}, {"heading": "4.

The robustness of this approximation suggests that we can train non-differentiable models and swap out non-differentiable components for smoothed versions for the purposes of calculating influence.\nTo see this, we trained a linear SVM on the same 1s vs. 7s MNIST task in Section 2.3.

Training was done with mini-batches of 500 examples and the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2015). The model had not converged after 500k iterations; training it for another 500k iterations, using a full training pass for each iteration, reduced train loss from 0.14 to 0.12.\nwise linear function is similar to ReLUs, which cause nondifferentiability in neural networks. We set the derivatives at the hinge to 0 and calculated Iup,loss. As one might expect, this was inaccurate (Fig 3b-Left): the second derivative carries no information about how close a support vector z is to the hinge, so the quadratic approximation of L(z, \u03b8\u0302) is linear, which leads to Iup,loss(z, ztest) overestimating the influence of z.\nFor the purposes of calculating influence, we approximated Hinge(s) with SmoothHinge(s, t) = t log(1+exp( 1\u2212st )), which approaches the hinge loss as t \u2192 0 (Fig 3a). Using the same SVM weights as before, we found that calculating Iup,loss using SmoothHinge(s, 0.001) closely matched the actual change due to retraining in the original Hinge(s) (Pearson\u2019s R = 0.95; Fig 3b-Mid) and remained accurate over a wide range of t (Fig 3b-Right)."}, {"heading": "5.

In this section, we show that two models can make the same correct predictions but get there in very different ways.\nWe compared (a) the state-of-the-art Inception v3 network (Szegedy et al., 2016) with all but the top layer frozen6 and (b) an SVM with an RBF kernel on a dog vs. fish image classification dataset we extracted from ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015), with 900 training examples for each class.

We picked a test image both models got correct (Fig 4-Top) and used SmoothHinge(\u00b7, 0.001) to compute the influence for the SVM.\nAs expected, Iup,loss in the RBF SVM varied inversely with raw pixel distance, with training images far from the test image in pixel space having almost no influence; the Inception influences were much less correlated with distance in pixel space (Fig 4-Left). Looking at the two most helpful images (most positive \u2212Iup,loss) for each model in Fig 4-Right, we see that the Inception network picked on the distinctive characteristics of clownfish, whereas the RBF SVM pattern-matched training images superficially.\nMoreover, in the RBF SVM, fish (green points) close to the test image were mostly helpful, while dogs (red) were mostly harmful, with the RBF acting as a soft nearest neighbor function (Fig 4-Left). In contrast, in the Inception network, fish and dogs could be helpful or harmful for correctly classifying the test image as a fish; in fact, the 5th most helpful training image was a dog that, to the model, looked very different from the test fish (Fig 4-Top)."}, {"heading": "5.2. Adversarial training examples", "text": "In this section, we show that models that place a lot of influence on a small number of points can be vulnerable to training input perturbations, posing a serious security risk in real-world ML systems where attackers can influence the training data (Huang et al., 2011). Recent work has generated adversarial test images that are visually indistinguish-\nable from real test images but completely fool a classifier (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016). We demonstrate that influence functions can be used to craft adversarial training images that are similarly visuallyindistinguishable and can flip a model\u2019s prediction on a separate test image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept that visually-indistinguishable training attacks can be executed on otherwise highly-accurate neural networks.\nThe key idea is that Ipert,loss(z, ztest) tells us how to modify training point z to most increase the loss on ztest. Concretely, for a target test image ztest, we can construct z\u0303i, an adversarial version of a training image zi, by initializing z\u0303i := zi and then iterating z\u0303i := \u03a0(z\u0303i + \u03b1 sign(Ipert,loss(z\u0303i, ztest))), where \u03b1 is a step size and \u03a0 projects onto the set of valid images that share the same 8- bit representation with zi. After each iteration, we retrain the model. This is an iterated, training-set analogue of the methods used by, e.g., Goodfellow et al. (2015); MoosaviDezfooli et al. (2016) for test-set attacks.\nWe tested these adversarial training perturbations on the same Inception network on dogs vs. fish from Section 5.1, choosing this pair of animals to provide a stark contrast between the classes. We set \u03b1 = 0.02 and ran the attack for 100 iterations on each test image. As before, we froze all but the top layer for training; note that computing Ipert,loss still involves differentiating through the entire network. Originally, the model correctly classified 591 / 600 test images. For each of these 591 test images, considered separately, we tried to find a visually-indistinguishable perturbation (i.e., same 8-bit representation) to a single training image, out of 1,800 total training images, that would flip the model\u2019s prediction. We were able to do this on 335 (57%) of the 591 test images. If we perturbed 2 training images for each test image, we could flip predictions on 77% of the 591 test images; and if we perturbed 10 training images, we could flip all but 1 of the 591. The above results are from attacking each test image separately, i.e., we use a different training set to attack each test image. We next tried to attack multiple test images simultaneously by increasing their average test loss, and found that single training image perturbations could simultaneously flip multiple test predictions as well (Fig 5).\nWe make three observations about these attacks. First, though the change in pixel values is small, the change in the final Inception feature layer is significantly larger: in pixel space and using L2 distance, the training values change by less than 1% of the mean distance of a training point to the class centroid, whereas in Inception feature space, the change is on the same order as the mean distance. Second, the attack tries to perturb the training example in a direction of low variance, causing the model to overfit in that\ndirection and consequently incorrectly classify the test images; we expect the attack to become harder as the number of training examples grows. Third, ambiguous or mislabeled training images are effective points to attack, since the model has low confidence and thus high loss on them, making them highly influential (recall Section 2.3). For example, the image in Fig 5 contains both a dog and a fish and is highly ambiguous; as a result, it is the training example that the model is least confident on (with a confidence of 77%, compared to the next lowest confidence of 90%).\nThis attack is mathematically equivalent to the gradientbased training set attacks explored by Biggio et al. (2012); Mei & Zhu (2015b) and others in the context of different models.Biggio et al. (2012) constructed a dataset poisoning attack against a linear SVM on a two-class MNIST task, but had to modify the training points in an obviously distinguishable way to be effective. Measuring the magnitude of Ipert,loss gives model developers a way of quantifying how vulnerable their models are to training-set attacks."}, {"heading": "5.3. Debugging domain mismatch", "text": "Domain mismatch \u2014 where the training distribution does not match the test distribution \u2014 can cause models with high training accuracy to do poorly on test data (Ben-David et al., 2010). We show that influence functions can identify the training examples most responsible for the errors, helping model developers identify domain mismatch.\nAs a case study, we predicted whether a patient would be readmitted to a hospital. Domain mismatches are common in biomedical data; for example, different hospitals can serve very different populations, and readmission models trained on one population can do poorly on another (Kansagara et al., 2011). We used logistic regression to predict readmission with a balanced training dataset of 20K diabetic patients from 100+ US hospitals, each represented by 127 features (Strack et al., 2014).7\n7Hospital readmission was defined as whether a patient would be readmitted within the next 30 days. Features were demo-\n3 out of the 24 children under age 10 in this dataset were re-admitted. To induce a domain mismatch, we filtered out 20 children who were not re-admitted, leaving 3 out of 4 readmitted. This caused the model to wrongly classify many children in the test set. Our aim is to identify the 4 children in the training set as being \u201cresponsible\u201d for these errors.\nAs a baseline, we tried the common practice of looking at the learned parameters \u03b8\u0302 to see if the indicator variable for being a child was obviously different. However, this did not work: 14/127 features had a larger coefficient.\nPicking a random child ztest that the model got wrong, we calculated\u2212Iup,loss(zi, ztest) for each training point zi. This clearly highlighted the 4 training children, each of whom were 30-40 times as influential as the next most influential examples. The 1 child in the training set who was not readmitted had a very positive influence, while the other 3 had very negative influences. Calculating Ipert,loss on these 4 children showed that a change in the \u2018child\u2019 indicator variable had by far the largest effect on Iup,loss."}, {"heading": "5.4. Fixing mislabeled examples", "text": "Labels in the real world are often noisy, especially if crowdsourced (Fre\u0301nay & Verleysen, 2014), and can even be adversarially corrupted, as in Section 5.2. Even if a human expert could recognize wrongly labeled examples, it is impossible in many applications to manually review all of the training data. We show that influence functions can help human experts prioritize their attention, allowing them to inspect only the examples that actually matter.\nThe key idea is to flag the training points that exert the most influence on the model. Because we do not have access to the test set, we measure the influence of zi with Iup,loss(zi, zi), which approximates the error incurred on zi if we remove zi from the training set.\nOur case study is email spam classification, which relies\ngraphic (e.g., age, race, gender), administrative (e.g., length of hospital stay), or medical (e.g., test results).\non user-provided labels and is also vulnerable to adversarial attack (Biggio et al., 2011). We flipped the labels of a random 10% of the training data and then simulated manually inspecting a fraction of the training points, correcting them if they had been flipped. Using influence functions to prioritize the training points to inspect allowed us to repair the dataset (Fig 6, blue) without checking too many points, outperforming the baselines of checking points with the highest train loss (Fig 6, green) or at random (Fig 6, red). No method had access to the test data."}, {"heading": "6. Related work", "text": "The use of influence-based diagnostics originated in statistics in the 70s, driven by the seminal papers of Hampel (1974) and Jaeckel (1972) (where it was called the infinitesimal jackknife). It was further developed in the book by Hampel et al. (1986) and many other contemporary papers (Cook, 1977; Cook & Weisberg, 1980; Pregibon et al., 1981; Cook & Weisberg, 1982). Earlier work focused on removing training points from linear models, with later work extending this to more general models and a wider variety of perturbations (Hampel et al., 1986; Cook, 1986; Thomas & Cook, 1990; Chatterjee & Hadi, 1986; Wei et al., 1998). Prior work mostly focused on experiments with small datasets, e.g., n = 24 and p = 10 in Cook & Weisberg (1980), and thus paid special attention to exact solutions, or if not possible, characterizations of the error terms.\nInfluence functions have not been used much in the ML literature, with some exceptions. Christmann & Steinwart (2004); Debruyne et al. (2008); Liu et al. (2014) use influence functions to study model robustness and to do fast cross-validation in kernel methods. Wojnowicz et al. (2016) use matrix sketching to estimate Cook\u2019s distance,\nwhich is closely related to influence; they focus on prioritizing training points for human attention and derive methods specific to generalized linear models. Kabra et al. (2015) define a different notion of influence that is specialized to finite hypothesis classes.\nAs noted in Section 5.2, our training-set attack is mathematically equivalent to an approach first explored by Biggio et al. (2012) in the context of SVMs, with follow-up work extending the framework and applying it to linear and logistic regression (Mei & Zhu, 2015b), topic modeling (Mei & Zhu, 2015a), and collaborative filtering (Li et al., 2016a). These papers derived the attack directly from the KKT conditions without considering influence, though for continuous data, the end result is equivalent. Influence functions additionally let us consider attacks on discrete data (Section 2.2), but we have not tested this empirically. Our work connects the literature on trainingset attacks with work on \u201cadversarial examples\u201d (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016), visuallyimperceptible perturbations on test inputs.\nIn contrast to training-set attacks, Cadamuro et al. (2016) consider the task of taking an incorrect test prediction and finding a small subset of training data such that changing the labels on this subset makes the prediction correct. They provide a solution for OLS and Gaussian process models when the labels are continuous. Our work with influence functions allow us to solve this problem in a much larger range of models and in datasets with discrete labels."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "We have discussed a variety of applications, from creating training-set attacks to debugging models and fixing datasets. Underlying each of these applications is a common tool, influence functions, which are based on a simple idea\u2014we can better understand model behavior by looking at how it was derived from its training data.\nAt their core, influence functions measure the effect of local changes: what happens when we upweight a point by an infinitesimally-small ? This locality allows us to derive efficient closed-form estimates, and as we show, they can be surprisingly effective. However, we might want to ask about more global changes, e.g., how does a subpopulation of patients from this hospital affect the model? Since influence functions depend on the model not changing too much, how to tackle this is an open question.\nIt seems inevitable that high-performing, complex, blackbox models will become increasingly prevalent and important. We hope that the approach presented here\u2014of looking at the model through the lens of the training data\u2014will become a standard part of the toolkit of developing, understanding, and diagnosing machine learning.\nReproducibility The code and data for replicating our experiments is available on GitHub http://bit.ly/gt-influence and Codalab http://bit.ly/cl-influence."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Jacob Steinhardt, Zhenghao Chen, and Hongseok Namkoong for helpful discussions and comments.

This work was supported by a Future of Life Research Award and a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship.\nA. Deriving the influence function Iup,params For completeness, we provide a standard derivation of the influence function Iup,params in the context of loss minimization (M-estimation). This derivation is based on asymptotic arguments and is not fully rigorous; see van der Vaart (1998) and other statistics textbooks for a more thorough treatment.\nRecall that \u03b8\u0302 minimizes the empirical risk:\nR(\u03b8) def =\n1\nn n\u2211 i=1 L(zi, \u03b8). (6)\nWe further assume that R is twice-differentiable and strongly convex in \u03b8, i.e.,\nH\u03b8\u0302 def = \u22072R(\u03b8\u0302) = 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 \u22072\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0302) (7)\nexists and is positive definite. This guarantees the existence of H\u22121\n\u03b8\u0302 , which we will use in the subsequent derivation.\nThe perturbed parameters \u03b8\u0302 ,z can be written as\n\u03b8\u0302 ,z = arg min \u03b8\u2208\u0398 {R(\u03b8) + L(z, \u03b8)} . (8)\nDefine the parameter change \u2206 = \u03b8\u0302 ,z \u2212 \u03b8\u0302, and note that, as \u03b8\u0302 doesn\u2019t depend on , the quantity we seek to compute can be written in terms of it:\nd\u03b8\u0302 ,z d = d\u2206 d . (9)\nSince \u03b8\u0302 ,z is a minimizer of (8), let us examine its firstorder optimality conditions:\n0 = \u2207R(\u03b8\u0302 ,z) + \u2207L(z, \u03b8\u0302 ,z). (10)\nNext, since \u03b8\u0302 ,z \u2192 \u03b8\u0302 as \u2192 0, we perform a Taylor expansion of the right-hand side:\n0 \u2248 [ \u2207R(\u03b8\u0302) + \u2207L(z, \u03b8\u0302) ] + (11)[\n\u22072R(\u03b8\u0302) + \u22072L(z, \u03b8\u0302) ] \u2206 ,\nwhere we have dropped o(\u2016\u2206 \u2016) terms.\nSolving for \u2206 , we get: \u2206 \u2248\u2212 [ \u22072R(\u03b8\u0302) + \u22072L(z, \u03b8\u0302) ]\u22121 (12)[\n\u2207R(\u03b8\u0302) + \u2207L(z, \u03b8\u0302) ] .\nSince \u03b8\u0302 minimizes R, we have \u2207R(\u03b8\u0302) = 0. Dropping o( ) terms, we have\n\u2206 \u2248\u2212\u22072R(\u03b8\u0302)\u22121\u2207L(z, \u03b8\u0302) . (13)\nCombining with (7) and (9), we conclude that:\nd\u03b8\u0302 ,z d \u2223\u2223\u2223 =0 = \u2212H\u22121 \u03b8\u0302 \u2207L(z, \u03b8\u0302) (14)\ndef = Iup,params(z). (15)\nB. Influence at non-convergence Consider a training point z. When the model parameters \u03b8\u0303 are close to but not at a local minimum, Iup,params(z) is approximately equal to a constant (which does not depend on z) plus the change in parameters after upweighting z and then taking a single Newton step from \u03b8\u0303. The high-level idea is that even though the gradient of the empirical risk at \u03b8\u0303 is not 0, the Newton step from \u03b8\u0303 can be decomposed into a component following the existing gradient (which does not depend on the choice of z) and a second component responding to the upweighted z (which Iup,params(z) tracks).\nLet g def= 1n \u2211n i=1\u2207\u03b8L(zi, \u03b8\u0303) be the gradient of the empirical risk at \u03b8\u0303; since \u03b8\u0303 is not a local minimum, g 6= 0. After upweighting z by , the gradient at \u03b8\u0303 goes from g 7\u2192 g + \u2207\u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0303), and the empirical Hessian goes from H\u03b8\u0303 7\u2192 H\u03b8\u0303 + \u22072\u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0303). A Newton step from \u03b8\u0303 therefore changes the parameters by:\nN ,z def = \u2212 [ H\u03b8\u0303 + \u2207 2 \u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0303) ]\u22121 [ g + \u2207\u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0303) ] .\n(16)\nIgnoring terms in g, 2, and higher, we get N ,z \u2248 \u2212H\u22121\n\u03b8\u0303\n( g + \u2207\u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0303) ) . Therefore, the actual change\ndue to a Newton step N ,z is equal to a constant \u2212H\u22121\u03b8\u0303 g (that doesn\u2019t depend on z) plus times Iup,params(z) = \u2212H\u22121\n\u03b8\u0303 \u2207\u03b8L(z, \u03b8\u0303) (which captures the contribution of z)."}], "year": 2021, "references": [{"title": "Auditing black-box models for indirect influence", "authors": ["P.

In this paper, we use influence functions \u2014 a classic technique from robust statistics \u2014 to trace a model\u2019s prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visuallyindistinguishable training-set attacks.", "title": "Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions"}
