0	20	The sheer number and variety of online social networks (OSN) today is staggering.
1	23	Although the purpose and the shaping of these networks vary generously, the majority of them has one aspect in common: the value of most OSNs is in its user data and the information that one can infer from the data.
2	48	This, unfortunately, results in a big incentive for culprits to intrude OSNs and manipulate their data.
3	23	One popular method of intruding and attacking an OSN is referred to as Sybil attack, where the intruder creates a whole bunch of fake (Sybil) accounts that are all under the attacker’s control.
4	14	The intruder’s influence over the OSN is multiplied by the number of accounts created, which opens possibilities of manipulation typically for gaining some monetary advantage in the end.
5	86	The term, Sybil attack, was coined by Douceur (2002) who showed that this kind of attack will be always possible unless a trusted agency certifies identities.
8	11	On the other hand, Sybil attacks can damage the value of OSNs significantly, which has been proved by the fact that Facebook shares dropped in 2012 after the company revealed that a significant share of its network is made up by Sybil accounts (The Associated Press, 2012).
9	16	There exists a number of “classic” feature-based solutions (Stein et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2012; Stringhini et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2014).
11	7	More recent graph-based Sybil detection methods assume that honest (non-Sybil) nodes form a strongly connected subgraph and attackers can establish a limited amount of edges which leads to a sparse cut between the honest subraph and the Sybil nodes.
12	4	The majority of the graph-based methods define trusted nodes, which the defender is sure to be honest, and use random walks (Yu et al., 2010; Danezis, 2009; Cao et al., 2012) or other typical graph-based algorithms like breadth-first-search (Tran et al., 2011) and belief propagation (Gong et al., 2014) to convey trust from the trusted nodes.
17	12	We further dicuss the robustness of the random walk approach against adversarial strategies.
18	30	To this end, we formally introduce adversarial settings for graph-based Sybil detection and derive an optimal attacking strategy that is based on the exploitation of trust leaks.
19	12	Based on our analysis, we propose a transductive Sybil ranking (TSR), an integrated approach capable of adjusting edge weights based on sampled trust leaks.
20	47	We empirically show good performance of TSR against the state-of-the-art baselines on a variety of attacking scenarios using artificially generated data as well as real-world Facebook data.
23	1	EA is the set of edges connecting any node in GS and any node in GH .
24	17	Sybil Rank is considered the state-of-the-art graph-based method to detect Sybil accounts as it outperformed all its contestants (Cao et al., 2012).
25	20	It is also based on random walks and operates solely on the topology of the graph.
26	15	Sybil Rank starts from the initial distribution {p(i)0 2 [0, 1]}|V |i=1 (without superscript refers to a vector containing all elements), in which “trust” is assigned to the known honest nodes VT : p (i) 0 = ( 1 |VT | if vi 2 VT , 0 otherwise.
27	28	(1) Then, it “propagates” the trust via a short (k steps) random walk: p > k = p > k 1Q = · · · = p>0 Qk , (2) where Q 2 R|V |⇥|V | is the transition matrix through the edges with Qi,j = ( P j0 1[(i, j 0 ) 2 E]) 1, if (i, j) 2 E, and else 0.
28	70	It is known that the stationary distribution ⇡ ⌘ p1 is the normalized degree distribution (Behrends, 2000) ⇡ > = ⇣ deg(v1) Vol(V ) , .
29	13	, deg(v|V |) Vol(V ) ⌘ , (3) where deg(v) is the degree of node v, i.e., the number of all incident edges of v, and Vol(V ) = P v2V deg(v) is the sum of the degrees for all nodes in V .
30	48	SybilRank conpensates the effect of degrees, and use the degree-normalized probability p (i) = p (i) k /⇡ (i) (4) as the ranking score, where a high ranking indicates a high probability of being an honest node.
31	66	Essentially, SybilRank relies on the assumption that the total number of attacking edges is bounded.
32	2	Under this assumption, only a small fraction of the trust is propagated through the sparse cut between the honest network and the Sybil nodes during the short random walk, while ”trust” go through the ”non-trusted” honest nodes through the dense connections within the the honest subgraph.
33	12	Boshmaf et al. (2016) developed Integro to cope with a larger number of attacking edges.
34	7	To this end, Integro introduces weights on the edges to bias the random walk, where the weights are determined after its pre-processing step to detect victims.
35	7	Here a victim is defined as a node that established a connection to one of the Sybil nodes.
37	21	After the detection step, Integro lowers the weights to all incident edges to the detected victims, which prevents the trust to propagate through victim nodes.
38	5	As the victims form a natural border between the honest and the Sybil graph, this reduces the overall flow of trust into the Sybil graph.
