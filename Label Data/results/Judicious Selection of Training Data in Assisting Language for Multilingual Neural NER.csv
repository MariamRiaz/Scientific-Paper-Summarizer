"Semantic role labeling (SRL) captures predicateargument relations, such as “who did what to whom.”",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent high-performing SRL models (He et al., 2017; Marcheggiani et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018) are BIO-taggers, labeling argument spans for a single predicate at a time (as shown in Figure 1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"They are typically only evaluated with gold predicates, and must be pipelined with error-prone predicate identification models for deployment.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We propose an end-to-end approach for predicting all the predicates and their argument spans in one forward pass.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model builds on a recent coreference resolution model (Lee et al., 2017), by making central use of learned, contextualized span representations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We use these representations to predict SRL graphs directly over text spans.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each edge is identified by independently predicting which role, if any, holds between every possible pair of text spans, while using aggressive beam

pruning for efficiency.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The final graph is simply the union of predicted SRL roles (edges) and their associated text spans (nodes).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our span-graph formulation overcomes a key limitation of semi-markov and BIO-based models (Kong et al., 2016; Zhou and Xu, 2015; Yang and Mitchell, 2017; He et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018): it can model overlapping spans across different predicates in the same output structure (see Figure 1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The span representations also generalize the token-level representations in BIObased models, letting the model dynamically decide which spans and roles to include, without using previously standard syntactic features (Punyakanok et al., 2008; FitzGerald et al., 2015).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first span-based SRL model that does not assume that predicates are given.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this more realistic setting, where the predicate must be predicted, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on PropBank.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It also reinforces the strong performance of similar span embedding methods for coreference (Lee et al., 2017), suggesting that this style of models could be used for other span-span relation tasks, such as syntactic parsing (Stern et al., 2017), relation extraction (Miwa and Bansal, 2016), and QA-SRL (FitzGerald et al., 2018).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We consider the space of possible predicates to be all the tokens in the input sentence, and the space of arguments to be all continuous spans.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Our model decides what relation exists between each predicate-argument pair (including no relation).

"We then define a set of random variables, where each random variable yp,a corresponds to a predicate p ∈ P and an argument a ∈ A, taking value from the discrete label space L.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"The random variables yp,a are conditionally independent of each other given the input X:
P (Y | X) = ∏
p∈P,a∈A P (yp,a | X) (1)
P (yp,a = l | X) = exp(φ(p, a, l))∑
l′∈L exp(φ(p, a, l′))

"(2)
Where φ(p, a, l) is a scoring function for a possible (predicate, argument, label) combination.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"φ is decomposed into two unary scores on the predicate and the argument (defined in Section 3), as well as a label-specific score for the relation:
φ(p, a, l) = Φa(a) + Φp(p) +",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Φ (l) rel (a, p) (3)
",2 Model,[0],[0]
"The score for the null label is set to a constant: φ(p, a, ) = 0, similar to logistic regression.

J (X) =,2 Model,[0],[0]
"− logP (Y ∗ | X) (4)
Beam pruning As our model deals with O(n2) possible argument spans and O(n) possible predicates, it needs to consider O(n3|L|) possible relations, which is computationally impractical.",2 Model,[0],[0]
"To overcome this issue, we define two beams Ba and Bp for storing the candidate arguments and predicates, respectively.",2 Model,[0],[0]
The candidates in each beam are ranked by their unary score (Φa or Φp).,2 Model,[0],[0]
The sizes of the beams are limited by λan and λpn.,2 Model,[0],[0]
"Elements that fall out of the beam do not participate
in computing the edge factors Φ(l)rel , reducing the overall number of relational factors evaluated by the model to O(n2|L|).",2 Model,[0],[0]
"We also limit the maximum width of spans to a fixed number W (e.g. W = 30), further reducing the number of computed unary factors to O(n).",2 Model,[0],[0]
"Our model builds contextualized representations for argument spans a and predicate words p based on BiLSTM outputs (Figure 2) and uses feedforward networks to compute the factor scores in φ(p, a, l) described in Section 2 (Figure 3).

"Word-level contexts The bottom layer consists of pre-trained word embeddings concatenated with character-based representations, i.e. for each token wi, we have xi = [WORDEMB(wi); CHARCNN(wi)].",3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"We then contextualize each xi using an m-layered bidirectional LSTM with highway connections (Zhang et al., 2016), which we denote as x̄i.
Argument and predicate representation We build contextualized representations for all candidate arguments a ∈ A and predicates p ∈ P .",3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"The argument representation contains the following: end points from the BiLSTM outputs (x̄START(a), x̄END(a)), a soft head word xh(a), and embedded span width features f(a), similar to Lee et al. (2017).",3 Neural Architecture,[0],[0]
"The predicate representation is simply the BiLSTM output at the position INDEX(p).

"g(a) =[x̄START(a); x̄END(a); xh(a); f(a)] (5)
g(p) =x̄INDEX(p) (6)
The soft head representation xh(a) is an attention mechanism over word inputs x in the argument span, where the weights e(a) are computed via a linear layer over the BiLSTM outputs x̄.

"We experiment on the CoNLL 2005 (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005) and CoNLL 2012 (OntoNotes 5.0, (Pradhan et al., 2013)) benchmarks, using two SRL setups: end-to-end and gold predicates.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In the end-to-end setup, a system takes a tokenized sentence as input, and predicts all the predicates and their arguments.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Systems are evaluated on the micro-averaged F1 for correctly predicting (predicate, argument span, label) tuples.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"For comparison with previous systems, we also report results with gold predicates, in which the complete set of predicates in the input sentence is given as well.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Other experimental setups and hyperparameteres are listed in Appendix A.1.
ELMo embeddings To further improve performance, we also add ELMo word representations (Peters et al., 2018) to the BiLSTM input (in the +ELMo rows).",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Since the contextualized representations ELMo provides can be applied to most previous neural systems, the improvement is orthogonal to our contribution.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"In Table 1 and 2, we organize all the results into two categories: the comparable single model systems, and the mod-
els augmented with ELMo or ensembling (in the PoE rows).
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"End-to-end results As shown in Table 1,2 our joint model outperforms the previous best pipeline system (He et al., 2017) by an F1 difference of anywhere between 1.3 and 6.0 in every setting.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The improvement is larger on the Brown test set, which is out-of-domain, and the CoNLL 2012 test set, which contains nominal predicates.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On all datasets, our model is able to predict over 40% of the sentences completely correctly.
",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Results with gold predicates To compare with additional previous systems, we also conduct experiments with gold predicates by constraining our predicate beam to be gold predicates only.",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"As shown in Table 2, our model significantly out-performs He et al. (2017), but falls short of Tan et al. (2018), a very recent attention-based (Vaswani et al., 2017)",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
BIO-tagging model that was developed concurrently with our work.,4 Experiments,[0],[0]
"By adding the contextualized ELMo representations, we are able to out-perform all previous systems, including Peters et al. (2018), which applies ELMo to the SRL model introduced in He et al. (2017).",4 Experiments,[0],[0]
Our model’s architecture differs significantly from previous BIO systems in terms of both input and decision space.,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"To better understand our model’s strengths and weaknesses, we perform three analyses following Lee et al. (2017) and He et al. (2017), studying (1) the effectiveness of beam

Effectiveness of beam pruning Figure 4 shows the predicate and argument spans kept in the beam, sorted with their unary scores.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Our model efficiently prunes unlikely argument spans and predicates, significantly reduces the number of edges it needs to consider.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
Figure 5 shows the recall of predicate words on the CoNLL 2012 development set.,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"By retaining λp = 0.4 predicates per word, we are able to keep over 99.7% argument-bearing predicates.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Compared to having a part-of-speech tagger (POS:X in Figure 5), our joint beam pruning allowing the model to have a soft trade-off between efficiency and recall.4
Long-distance dependencies Figure 6 shows the performance breakdown by binned distance between arguments to the given predicates.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Our model is better at accurately predicting arguments that are farther away from the predicates, even
3For comparability with prior work, analyses (2)-(4) are performed on the CoNLL 05 dev set with gold predicates.
",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"4The predicate ID accuracy of our model is not comparable with that reported in He et al. (2017), since our model does not predict non-argument-bearing predicates.
",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"compared to an ensemble model (He et al., 2017) that has a higher overall F1.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"This is very likely due to architectural differences; in a BIO tagger, predicate information passes through many LSTM timesteps before reaching a long-distance argument, whereas our architecture enables direct connections between all predicates-arguments pairs.
Agreement with syntax As mentioned in He et al. (2017), their BIO-based SRL system has good agreement with gold syntactic span boundaries (94.3%) but falls short of previous syntaxbased systems (Punyakanok et al., 2004).",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"By directly modeling span information, our model achieves comparable syntactic agreement (95.0%) to Punyakanok et al. (2004) without explicitly modeling syntax.
",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Global consistency On the other hand, our model suffers from global consistency issues.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"For example, on the CoNLL 2005 test set, our model has lower complete-predicate accuracy (62.6%) than the BIO systems (He et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2018) (64.3%-66.4%).",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Table 3 shows its viola-
tions of global structural constraints5 compared to previous systems.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
Our model made more constraint violations compared to previous systems.,5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"For example, our model predicts duplicate core arguments6 (shown in the U column in Table 3) more often than previous work.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"This is due to the fact that our model uses independent classifiers to label each predicate-argument pair, making it difficult for them to implicitly track the decisions made for several arguments with the same predicate.

"The Ours+decode row in Table 3 shows SRL performance after enforcing the U-constraint using dynamic programming (Täckström et al., 2015) at decoding time.",5 Analysis,[0],[0]
"Constrained decoding at test time is effective at eliminating all the core-role inconsistencies (shown in the U-column), but did not bring significant gain on the end result (shown

"Compared to previous BIO systems, our new model supports joint predicate identification and is able to incorporate span-level features.",6 Conclusion and Future Work,[0],[0]
"Empirically, the model does better at longrange dependencies and agreement with syntactic boundaries, but is weaker at global consistency, due to our strong independence assumption.

"We consistently observe improvements for German and Italian NER using our data selection strategy, irrespective of whether only subword features are shared (Sub-word) or the entire network (All) is shared across languages.

Adding all Spanish/Dutch sentences to Italian data leads to drop in Italian NER performance when all layers are shared.,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
Label drift from overlapping entities is one of the reasons for the poor results.,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
This can be observed by comparing the histograms of English and Spanish sentences ranked by the SKL scores for Italian multilingual learning (Figure 1).,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[1.0],['This can be observed by comparing the histograms of English and Spanish sentences ranked by the SKL scores for Italian multilingual learning (Figure 1).']
Most English sentences have lower SKL scores indicating higher tag agreement for overlapping entities and lower drift in tag distribution.,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"Hence, adding all English sentences improves Italian NER accuracy.",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"In contrast, most Spanish sentences have larger SKL
scores and adding these sentences adversely impacts Italian NER performance.",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"By judiciously selecting assisting language sentences, we eliminate sentences which are responsible for drift occurring during multilingual learning.
",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"To understand how overlapping entities impact the NER performance, we study the statistics of overlapping named entities between ItalianEnglish and Italian-Spanish pairs.",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
911 and 916 unique entities out of 4061 unique Italian entities appear in the English and Spanish data respectively.,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
We had hypothesized that entities with divergent tag distribution are responsible for hindering the performance in multilingual learning.,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
If we sort the common entities based on their SKL divergence value.,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
We observe that 484 out of 911 common entities in English and 535 out of 916 common entities in Spanish have an SKL score greater than 1.0. 162 out of 484 common entities in English-Italian data having SKL divergence value greater than 1.0 also appear more than 10 times in the English corpus.,4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"Similarly, 123 out of 535 common entities in Spanish-Italian data having SKL divergence value greater than 1.0 also appear more than 10 times in the Spanish corpus.",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"However, these common 162 entities have a combined frequency of 12893 in English, meanwhile the 123 common entities have a combined frequency of 34945 in Spanish.",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"To summarize, although the number of overlapping entities is comparable in English and Spanish sentences, entities with larger SKL divergence score appears more frequently in Spanish sentences compared to English sentences.",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"As a consequence, adding all Spanish sentences leads to significant drop in Italian NER performance which is not the case when all English sentences are added.",4.1 Resource-Rich Languages,[0],[0]
"As Indian languages exhibit high lexical overlap (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016) and syntactic relatedness (V Subbãrão, 2012), we share all layers of the network across languages.",4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[0],[0]
Table 3 presents the results.,4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[0],[0]
"Bengali, Malayalam, and Tamil (low-resource languages) benefits from our data selection strategy.",4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[1.0],"['Bengali, Malayalam, and Tamil (low-resource languages) benefits from our data selection strategy.']"
"Hindi and Marathi NER performance improves when the other is used as assisting language.
",4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[0],[0]
"Bengali, Malayalam, and Tamil have weaker baselines compared to Hindi and Marathi, and are benefited from our approach irrespective of the assisting language chosen.",4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[1.0],"['Bengali, Malayalam, and Tamil have weaker baselines compared to Hindi and Marathi, and are benefited from our approach irrespective of the assisting language chosen.']"
"However, Hindi and Marathi are not benefited from multilingual learning with Bengali, Malayalam and Tamil.",4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[0],[0]
Malayalam and Tamil being morphologically rich have low entity overlap (surface level) with Hindi and Marathi.,4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[1.0],['Malayalam and Tamil being morphologically rich have low entity overlap (surface level) with Hindi and Marathi.']
"As a result, only 2-3% of Malayalam and Tamil sentences are eliminated from our approach, leading to no gains from multilingual learning.",4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[0],[0]
Hindi and Marathi are negatively impacted by noisy Bengali data.,4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[1.0],['Hindi and Marathi are negatively impacted by noisy Bengali data.']
"Bengali has less training sentences compared to other languages and, choosing a low SKL threshold results in selecting very few Bengali sentences for multilingual learning.",4.2 Resource-Poor Languages,[1.0],"['Bengali has less training sentences compared to other languages and, choosing a low SKL threshold results in selecting very few Bengali sentences for multilingual learning.']"
"Here, we study the influence of SKL score threshold on the NER performance.",4.3 Influence of SKL Threshold,[0],[0]
We run experiments for Italian NER by adding Spanish training sentences and sharing all layers except for output layer across languages.,4.3 Influence of SKL Threshold,[1.0],['We run experiments for Italian NER by adding Spanish training sentences and sharing all layers except for output layer across languages.']
"We vary the threshold value from 1.0 to 9.0 in steps of 1, and select sentences with score less than the threshold.",4.3 Influence of SKL Threshold,[0],[0]
"A threshold of 0.0 indicates monolingual training and threshold greater than 9.0 indicates all assist-
ing language sentences considered.",4.3 Influence of SKL Threshold,[0],[0]
The plot of Italian test F-Score against SKL score is shown in the Figure 2.,4.3 Influence of SKL Threshold,[1.0],['The plot of Italian test F-Score against SKL score is shown in the Figure 2.']
Italian test F-Score increases initially as we add more and more Spanish sentences and then drops due to influence of drift becoming significant.,4.3 Influence of SKL Threshold,[0],[0]
"Finding the right SKL threshold is important, hence we use a validation set to tune the SKL threshold.",4.3 Influence of SKL Threshold,[0],[0]
