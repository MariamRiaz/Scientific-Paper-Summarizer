Introduction", "text": "There is a fundamental tension in decision making between choosing the action that has highest expected utility and avoiding \u201cstarving\u201d the other actions. The issue arises in the context of the exploration\u2013exploitation dilemma (Thrun, 1992), non-stationary decision problems (Sutton, 1990), and when interpreting observed decisions (Baker et al., 2007).\nIn reinforcement learning, an approach to addressing the tension is the use of softmax operators for value-function optimization, and softmax policies for action selection. Examples include value-based methods such as SARSA (Rummery & Niranjan, 1994) or expected SARSA (Sutton & Barto, 1998; Van Seijen et al., 2009), and policy-search methods such as REINFORCE (Williams, 1992).\n1Brown University, USA.

We define the following operators:\nmax(X) = max i\u2208{1,...,n} xi ,\nmean(X) = 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\nxi ,\neps (X) = mean(X) + (1\u2212 ) max(X) ,\nboltz\u03b2(X) = \u2211n i=1 xi e \u03b2xi\n\u2211n i=1 e \u03b2xi .\nThe first operator, max(X), is known to be a non-expansion (Littman & Szepesva\u0301ri, 1996). However, it is non-differentiable (Property 3), and ignores non-maximizing selections (Property 4).\nThe next operator, mean(X), computes the average of its inputs. It is differentiable and, like any operator that takes a fixed convex combination of its inputs, is a non-expansion. However, it does not allow for maximization (Property 1).\nThe third operator eps (X), commonly referred to as epsilon greedy (Sutton & Barto, 1998), interpolates between max and mean. The operator is a non-expansion, because it is a convex combination of two non-expansion operators. But it is non-differentiable (Property 3).\nThe Boltzmann operator boltz\u03b2(X) is differentiable. It also approximates max as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, and mean as \u03b2 \u2192 0. However, it is not a non-expansion (Property 2), and therefore, prone to misbehavior as will be shown in the next section.\nIn the following section, we provide a simple example illustrating why the non-expansion property is important, especially in the context of planning and on-policy learning. We then present a new softmax operator that is similar to the Boltzmann operator yet is a non-expansion. We prove several critical properties of this new operator, introduce a new softmax policy, and present empirical results."}, {"heading": "2.

Also, state s2 is a terminal state, so we only consider two action values, namely Q\u0302(s1, a) and Q\u0302(s2, b). Recall that the Boltzmann softmax policy assigns the following probability to each action:\n\u03c0(a|s) = e \u03b2Q\u0302(s,a)\n\u2211 a e \u03b2Q\u0302(s,a) .\nAlgorithm 1 SARSA with Boltzmann softmax policy Input: initial Q\u0302(s, a) \u2200s \u2208 S \u2200a \u2208 A, \u03b1, and \u03b2 for each episode do\nInitialize s a \u223c Boltzmann with parameter \u03b2 repeat\nTake action a, observe r, s\u2032 a \u2032 \u223c Boltzmann with parameter \u03b2 Q\u0302(s, a)\u2190 Q\u0302(s, a) + \u03b1 [ r + \u03b3Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032)\u2212 Q\u0302(s, a) ]\ns\u2190 s\u2032 , a\u2190 a\u2032 until s is terminal\nend for\nIn Figure 2, we plot state\u2013action value estimates at the end of each episode of a single run (smoothed by averaging over ten consecutive points).

The value estimates are unstable.\nSARSA is known to converge in the tabular setting using -greedy exploration (Littman & Szepesva\u0301ri, 1996), under decreasing exploration (Singh et al., 2000), and to a region in the function-approximation setting (Gordon, 2001). There are also variants of the SARSA update rule that converge more generally (Perkins & Precup, 2002; Baird & Moore, 1999; Van Seijen et al., 2009).

The functions R : S \u00d7A \u2192 R and P : S \u00d7 A\u00d7 S \u2192 [0, 1] denote the reward and transition dynamics of the MDP.

As mentioned earlier, the max operator is known to be a non-expansion, as illustrated in Figure 3. mean and eps operators are also non-expansions. Therefore, each of these operators can play the role of \u2297 in GVI, resulting in convergence to the corresponding unique\nfixed point. However, the Boltzmann softmax operator, boltz\u03b2 , is not a non-expansion (Littman, 1996). Note that we can relate GVI to SARSA by observing that SARSA\u2019s update is a stochastic implementation of GVI\u2019s update.

Boltzmann Has Multiple Fixed Points", "text": "Although it has been known for a long time that the Boltzmann operator is not a non-expansion (Littman, 1996), we are not aware of a published example of an MDP for which two distinct fixed points exist. The MDP presented in Figure 1 is the first example where, as shown in Figure 4, GVI under boltz\u03b2 has two distinct fixed points. We also show, in Figure 5, a vector field visualizing GVI updates under boltz\u03b2=16.55. The updates can move the current estimates farther from the fixed points. The behavior of SARSA (Figure 2) results from the algorithm stochastically bouncing back and forth between the two fixed points. When the learning algorithm performs a sequence of noisy updates, it moves from a fixed point to the other. As we will show later, planning will also progress extremely slowly near the fixed points. The lack of the non-expansion property leads to multiple fixed points and ultimately a misbehavior in learning and planning."}, {"heading": "5.

However, it is often useful to actually provide a probability distribution over the actions such that (1) a non-zero probability mass is assigned to each action, and (2) the resulting expected value equals the computed value. Such a probability distribution can then be used for action selection in algorithms such as SARSA.\nIn this section, we address the problem of identifying such a probability distribution as a maximum entropy problem\u2014over all distributions that satisfy the properties above, pick the one that maximizes information entropy (Cover & Thomas, 2006; Peters et al., 2010). We formally define the maximum entropy mellowmax policy of a state s as:\n\u03c0mm(s) = argmin \u03c0\n\u2211 a\u2208A \u03c0(a|s) log ( \u03c0(a|s) ) (2)\nsubject to { \u2211 a\u2208A \u03c0(a|s)Q\u0302(s, a) = mm\u03c9(Q\u0302(s, .))\n\u03c0(a|s) \u2265 0\u2211 a\u2208A \u03c0(a|s) = 1 .\nNote that this optimization problem is convex and can be solved reliably using any numerical convex optimization library.\nOne way of finding the solution, which leads to an interesting policy form, is to use the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers. Here, the Lagrangian is:\nL(\u03c0, \u03bb1, \u03bb2) = \u2211\na\u2208A \u03c0(a|s) log\n( \u03c0(a|s) )\n\u2212\u03bb1 (\u2211\na\u2208A \u03c0(a|s)\u2212 1\n)\n\u2212\u03bb2 (\u2211\na\u2208A \u03c0(a|s)Q\u0302(s, a)\u2212mm\u03c9\n( Q\u0302(s, .) )) .\nTaking the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to each \u03c0(a|s) and setting them to zero, we obtain:\n\u2202L \u2202\u03c0(a|s) = log ( \u03c0(a|s) ) +1\u2212\u03bb1\u2212\u03bb2Q\u0302(s, a) = 0 \u2200 a \u2208 A .\nThese |A| equations, together with the two linear constraints in (2), form |A| + 2 equations to constrain the |A| + 2 variables \u03c0(a|s) \u2200a \u2208 A and the two Lagrangian multipliers \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\nSolving this system of equations, the probability of taking an action under the maximum entropy mellowmax policy has the form:\n\u03c0mm(a|s) = e\u03b2Q\u0302(s,a)\u2211 a\u2208A e \u03b2Q\u0302(s,a) \u2200a \u2208 A ,\nwhere \u03b2 is a value for which:\n\u2211 a\u2208A e\u03b2 ( Q\u0302(s,a)\u2212mm\u03c9Q\u0302(s,.) )( Q\u0302(s, a)\u2212mm\u03c9Q\u0302(s, .) ) = 0 .\nThe argument for the existence of a unique root is simple. As \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e the term corresponding to the best action dominates, and so, the function is positive. Conversely, as \u03b2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e the term corresponding to the action with lowest utility dominates, and so the function is negative. Finally, by taking the derivative, it is clear that the function is monotonically increasing, allowing us to conclude that there exists only a single root. Therefore, we can find \u03b2 easily using any root-finding algorithm. In particular, we use Brent\u2019s method (Brent, 2013) available in the Numpy library of Python.\nThis policy has the same form as Boltzmann softmax, but with a parameter \u03b2 whose value depends indirectly on \u03c9. This mathematical form arose not from the structure of mm\u03c9 , but from maximizing the entropy. One way to view the use of the mellowmax operator, then, is as a form of Boltzmann policy with a temperature parameter chosen adaptively in each state to ensure that the non-expansion property holds.\nFinally, note that the SARSA update under the maximum entropy mellowmax policy could be thought of as a\nstochastic implementation of the GVI update under the mm\u03c9 operator:\nE \u03c0mm\n[ r + \u03b3Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032) \u2223\u2223s, a ] =\n\u2211 s\u2032\u2208S R(s, a, s\u2032) + \u03b3P(s, a, s\u2032) \u2211 a\u2032\u2208A \u03c0mm(a \u2032|s\u2032)Q\u0302(s\u2032, a\u2032) ]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 mm\u03c9 ( Q\u0302(s\u2032,.) )\ndue to the first constraint of the convex optimization problem (2). Because mellowmax is a non-expansion, SARSA with the maximum entropy mellowmax policy is guaranteed to converge to a unique fixed point. Note also that, similar to other variants of SARSA, the algorithm simply bootstraps using the value of the next state while implementing the new policy."}, {"heading": "7. Experiments on MDPs", "text": "We observed that in practice computing mellowmax can yield overflow if the exponentiated values are large.

The result, presented in Figure 6, show a rapid and steady convergence towards the unique fixed point. As a result, GVI under mm\u03c9 can terminate significantly faster than GVI under boltz\u03b2 , as illustrated in Figure 7.\nWe present three additional experiments. The first experiment investigates the behavior of GVI with the softmax operators on randomly generated MDPs.

We initialized the transition probabilities by sampling uniformly from [0, .01]. We then added to each entry, with probability 0.5, Gaussian noise with mean 1 and variance 0.1. We next added, with probability 0.1, Gaussian noise with mean 100 and variance 1. Finally, we normalized the raw values to ensure that we get a transition matrix. We did a similar process for rewards, with the difference that we divided each entry by the maximum entry and multiplied by 0.5 to ensure that Rmax = 0.5 .\nWe measured the failure rate of GVI under boltz\u03b2 and mm\u03c9 by stopping GVI when it did not terminate in 1000 iterations. We also computed the average number of iterations needed before termination. A summary of results is presented in the table below. Mellowmax outperforms Boltzmann based on the three measures provided below.\nMDPs, no terminate MDPs, > 1 fixed points average iterations\nboltz\u03b2 8 of 200 3 of 200 231.65 mm\u03c9 0 0 201.32"}, {"heading": "7.2. Multi-passenger Taxi Domain", "text": "We evaluated SARSA on the multi-passenger taxi domain introduced by Dearden et al. (1998). (See Figure 8.)\nOne challenging aspect of this domain is that it admits many locally optimal policies. Exploration needs to be set carefully to avoid either over-exploring or under-exploring the state space. Note also that Boltzmann softmax performs remarkably well on this domain, outperforming sophisticated Bayesian\nreinforcement-learning algorithms (Dearden et al., 1998). As shown in Figure 9, SARSA with the epsilon-greedy policy performs poorly. In fact, in our experiment, the algorithm rarely was able to deliver all the passengers. However, SARSA with Boltzmann softmax and SARSA with the maximum entropy mellowmax policy achieved significantly higher average reward. Maximum entropy mellowmax policy is no worse than Boltzmann softmax, here, suggesting that the greater stability does not come at the expense of less effective exploration."}, {"heading": "7.3. Lunar Lander Domain", "text": "In this section, we evaluate the use of the maximum entropy mellowmax policy in the context of a policy-gradient algorithm. Specifically, we represent a policy by a neural network (discussed below) that maps from states to probabilities over actions. A common choice for the activation function of the last layer is the Boltzmann softmax policy. In contrast, we can use maximum entropy mellowmax policy, presented in Section 6, by treating the inputs of the activation function as Q\u0302 values.\nWe used the lunar lander domain, from OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) as our benchmark. A screenshot of the domain is presented in Figure 10. This domain has a continuous state space with 8 dimensions, namely x-y coordinates, x-y velocities, angle and angular velocities, and leg-touchdown sensors. There are 4 discrete actions to control 3 engines. The reward is +100 for a safe landing in the designated area, and \u2212100 for a crash. There is a small shaping reward for approaching the landing area. Using the engines results in a negative reward. An episode finishes when the spacecraft crashes or lands. Solving the domain is defined as maintaining mean episode return higher than 200 in 100 consecutive episodes.\nThe policy in our experiment is represented by a neural network with a hidden layer comprised of 16 units with RELU activation functions, followed by a second layer with 16 units and softmax activation functions. We used REINFORCE to train the network. A batch episode size\nof 10 was used, as we had stability issues with smaller episode batch sizes. We used the Adam algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with \u03b1 = 0.005 and the other parameters as suggested by the paper. We used Keras (Chollet, 2015) and Theano (Team et al., 2016) to implement the neural network architecture. For each softmax policy, we present in Figure 11 the learning curves for different values of their free parameter. We further plot average return over all 40000 episodes. Mellowmax outperforms Boltzmann at its peak."}, {"heading": "8. Related Work", "text": "Softmax operators play an important role in sequential decision-making algorithms.\nIn model-free reinforcement learning, they can help strike\na balance between exploration (mean) and exploitation (max). Decision rules based on epsilon-greedy and Boltzmann softmax, while very simple, often perform surprisingly well in practice, even outperforming more advanced exploration techniques (Kuleshov & Precup, 2014) that require significant approximation for complex domains. When learning \u201con policy\u201d, exploration steps can (Rummery & Niranjan, 1994) and perhaps should (John, 1994) become part of the value-estimation process itself. On-policy algorithms like SARSA can be made to converge to optimal behavior in the limit when the exploration rate and the update operator is gradually moved toward max (Singh et al., 2000). Our use of softmax in learning updates reflects this point of view and shows that the value-sensitive behavior of Boltzmann exploration can be maintained even as updates are made stable.\nAnalyses of the behavior of human subjects in choice experiments very frequently use softmax. Sometimes referred to in the literature as logit choice (Stahl & Wilson, 1994), it forms an important part of the most accurate predictor of human decisions in normal-form games (Wright & Leyton-Brown, 2010), quantal level-k reasoning (QLk). Softmax-based fixed points play a crucial role in this work. As such, mellowmax could potentially make a good replacement.\nAlgorithms for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), the problem of inferring reward functions from observed behavior (Ng & Russell, 2000), frequently use a Boltzmann operator to avoid assigning zero probability to non-optimal actions and hence assessing an observed sequence as impossible. Such methods include Bayesian IRL (Ramachandran & Amir, 2007), natural gradient IRL (Neu & Szepesva\u0301ri, 2007), and maximum likelihood IRL (Babes et al., 2011). Given the recursive nature of value defined in these problems, mellowmax could be a more stable and efficient choice.\nIn linearly solvable MDPs (Todorov, 2006), an operator similar to mellowmax emerges when using an alternative characterization for cost of action selection in MDPs. Inspired by this work Fox et al. (2016) introduced an off-policy G-learning algorithm that uses the operator to perform value-function updates. Instead of performing off-policy updates, we introduced a convergent variant of SARSA with Boltzmann policy and a state-dependent temperature parameter. This is in contrast to Fox et al. (2016) where an epsilon greedy behavior policy is used."}, {"heading": "9. Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We proposed the mellowmax operator as an alternative to the Boltzmann softmax operator. We showed that mellowmax has several desirable properties and that it works favorably in practice. Arguably, mellowmax could be used in place of Boltzmann throughout reinforcement-learning research.\nA future direction is to analyze the fixed point of planning, reinforcement-learning, and game-playing algorithms when using the mellowmax operators. In particular, an interesting analysis could be one that bounds the sub-optimality of the fixed points found by GVI.\nAn important future work is to expand the scope of our theoretical understanding to the more general function approximation setting, in which the state space or the action space is large and abstraction techniques are used. Note that the importance of non-expansion in the function approximation case is well-established. (Gordon, 1995)\nFinally, due to the convexity of mellowmax (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004), it is compelling to use it in a gradient-based algorithm in the context of sequential decision making. IRL is a natural candidate given the popularity of softmax in this setting."}, {"heading": "10. Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of George D.
