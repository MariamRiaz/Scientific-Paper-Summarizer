0	44	Density functions that represent sample data are often multimodal, i.e. they exhibit more than one maximum.
9	28	A mixture on Rd with M components is a pair (π, p) ∈ ∆◦M × D(Rd)M , where ∆◦M := {π ∈ (0, 1]M : ∑ m πm = 1}; we write |(π, p)| := M , and note that π cannot have any components equal to zero.
10	12	The corresponding mixture density is 〈π, p〉 := ∑M m=1 πmpm.
12	10	Now J(π, p) is the mutual information between the random variables Ξ ∼ π and X ∼ 〈π, p〉.
13	90	Since mutual information is always nonnegative, the same is true of J .
18	55	The unimodal category ucat(f) is the smallest number of components of any unimodal mixture (π, p) that satisfies 〈π, p〉 = f .
20	27	In the event that 〈π, p〉 = f and |(π, p)| = ucat(f), we write (π, p) |= f : the symbol |= is called “models.” The unimodal category is a topological invariant that generalizes and relates to other classical invariants (Baryshnikov & Ghrist, 2011; Ghrist, 2014).
45	19	Lemma 1 states that that J is convex under perturbations of (π, p) that preserve 〈π, p〉.
46	11	Lemma 2 is Algorithm 1 Topological Mixture Estimation (TME) Input: function data {xk, f(xk)} Initialize (π, p) |= f as in (Baryshnikov & Ghrist, 2011) repeat for each evaluation point and pair of components do Greedily perturb (π, p) to (π′, p′) using Lemma 2 end for Update (π, p) = arg max J(π′, p′) until (π, p) and/or J(π, p) converge Output: (π, p) a characterization of perturbations of two components of a piecewise affine and continuous (or piecewise constant) mixture that preserve the predicate (π, p) |= f , i.e., that preserve unimodality (as in Figure 2) and the mixture density.
47	10	Together, these results entail Theorem 1, which establishes that greedy unimodality- and density-preserving local perturbations of pairs of mixture components converge to (3).
48	14	Let −∞ = x−1 < x0 < · · · < xN < xN+1 = ∞ and f be piecewise constant (or affine) over each [xk, xk+1].
50	71	By Lemma 1 (see §A), greedily and locally perturbing the mixture (π, p) |= f according to Lemma 2 (see §B), then updating the mixture according to the perturbation which optimizes J gives the desired result in O(MN) iterations.
54	11	There is a natural approach to this preliminary estimation process called topological density estimation (TDE) (Huntsman, 2017) that naturally dovetails with TME.
57	11	Given a kernel K and sample data Xj for 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and for each proposed bandwidth h, compute the kernel density estimate (Silverman, 1986; Chen, 2017) f̂h;X := 1 n n∑ j=1 KXj ,h (4) where Kµ,σ(x) := 1σK( x−µ σ ).
59	15	(6) gives the most prevalent and topologically persistent (Ghrist, 2014; Oudot, 2015) value of the unimodal category, i.e., this is a topologically robust estimate of the number of components required to produce the PDF that X is sampled from as a mixture.
71	15	In situtations of practical interest, it is tempting to couple TDE and TME in the obvious way: i.e., perform them sequentially and indepdently.
72	14	This yields a completely nonparametric estimate of a mixture from sample data alone.
89	11	(13) This preserves the result of TDE while giving a smoother, less artificial, and more practically useful mixture estimate than the information theoretically optimal result.
94	11	First, in Figures 6 and 7 we consider the n = 272 waiting times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser from the data set in (Härdle, 2012).
95	22	Then, in Figures 8 and 9 we consider the n = 2107 Sloan Digitial Sky Survey g − r color indices accessed from the VizieR database (Ochsen- bein et al., 2000) at http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.
97	12	As suggested, several phenomena are readily apparent from these examples.
98	10	First, mixtures obtained via the sweep algorithm are manifestly parity-dependent, i.e., the direction of sweeping matters; second, mixtures obtained via TME alone exhibit artificial anti-overlapping behavior; third, deblurring followed by reblurring preserves unimodality, the overall density, a topologically persistent invariant (viz., the unimodal category) and the spirit of information-theoretical optimality while producing an obviously better behaved mixture; fourth and finally, the various techniques involved here can significantly shift classification/decision boundaries based on the dominance of various mixture components.
99	14	While the data in Figures 6 and 7 is at least qualitatively approximated by a two-component Gaussian mixture, it is clear that a three-component Gaussian mixture cannot capture the highly oscillatory behavior of the density in Figures 8 and 9.
100	10	Indeed, this example illustrates how such oscillatory behavior can actually arise from a unimodal mixture with many fewer components than might naively appear to be required.
111	23	Even though TME is presently limited to one dimension, it is still very useful due to the preponderance of onedimensional problems.
114	15	(Kalai et al., 2012)) and anomaly detection (Pevný, 2016).
117	21	One reason is that computing a unimodal decomposition is algorithmically undecidable in high dimensions, a property inherited from the problem of determining contractibility of simplicial complexes (Tancer, 2016) and the geometric realization theorem (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010) applied to level and upper excursion sets.
124	17	Besides working with random projections in this vein, another sensible approach (suggested to the author by Robert Ghrist) is to foliate (Lawson Jr., 1974) the domain of a sample (in practice this would just mean taking a family of parallel lines) and perform TME on data in tubular neighborhoods of nearby leaves of the foliation, then assemble the results, essentially by interpolating.
125	27	Here topological tools such as sheaves and Morse theory seem inevitably to be required in order to do things in a globally coherent way.
127	42	Finally, we note that there are prospects for recursively coupling TME and TDE: the idea here is to pull mixture components back to weighted subsamples, then re-run TDE (or in the unimodal case, CV) on these individually.
