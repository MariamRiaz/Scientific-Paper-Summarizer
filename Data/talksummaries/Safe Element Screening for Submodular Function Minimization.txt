47	1	Moreover, for w ∈ Rp and α ∈ R, we let [w]k be the k-th component of w and {w ≥ α} (resp.
54	1	The submodular polyhedra P (F ) and the base polyhedra B(F ) are defined as: P (F )={s∈ Rp : ∀A ⊆ V, s(A) ≤ F (A)}, B(F )={s∈ Rp : s(V ) = F (V ),∀A ⊆ V, s(A) ≤ F (A)}.
60	1	Let ψ1, ..., ψp be p convex functions on R, ψ∗1 , ..., ψ ∗ p be their Fenchel-conjugates (Borwein & Lewis, 2010), and f be the Lovász extension of a submodular function F .
68	1	(R2) We call the j-th element active if j ∈ E and the ones in G inactive.
71	1	We formalize this idea in Lemma 1.
72	1	Given two subsets Ĝ ⊆ G and Ê ⊆ E , the followings hold: (i): Ê ⊆ A∗, and for all j ∈ Ĝ we have j /∈ A∗.
87	1	Thus, the corresponding problems Q-P and Q-D then become: min ŵ∈Rp̂ P̂ (ŵ) := f̂(ŵ) + 1 2 ‖ŵ‖22, (Q-P’) max ŝ∈B(F̂ ) D̂(ŝ) := −1 2 ‖ŝ‖22, (Q-D’) where f̂(ŵ) is the Lovász extension of F̂ and p̂ = |V/(Ê ∪ Ĝ)|.
88	2	Now, we turn to estimate the minimizer ŵ∗ of the problem Q-P’.
90	1	For any ŵ ∈ domP̂ (ŵ), ŝ ∈ B(F̂ ) and C ⊆ V̂ , we denote the dual gap as G(ŵ, ŝ) = P̂ (ŵ) − D̂(ŝ), and then we have ŵ∗ ∈ W = B ∩ Ω ∩ P, where B = { w : ‖w − ŵ‖ ≤ √ 2G(ŵ, ŝ) } , Ω = { w : F̂ (V̂ ) − 2F̂ (C) ≤ ‖w‖1 ≤ ‖ŝ‖1 } , and P = { w : 〈w,1〉 = −F̂ (V̂ ) } .
105	1	(IES-1) (iii): The active and inactive sets Ê and Ĝ can be updated by Ê ← Ê ∪∆Ê , (4) Ĝ ← Ĝ ∪∆Ĝ, (5) where ∆Ê and ∆Ĝ are the newly identified active and inactive sets defined as ∆Ê := {j ∈ V/(Ê ∪ Ĝ) : [w]minj > 0}, ∆Ĝ := {j ∈ V/(Ê ∪ Ĝ) : [w]maxj < 0}.
106	1	From the theorem above, we can see that our rules AES-1 and IES-1 are safe in the sense that the detected elements are guaranteed to be included or excluded in A∗.
114	1	(iii): ∀j ∈ p̂, if − √ 2G(ŵ, ŝ) ≤ [ŵ]j < 0, we have min w∈B,[w]j≥0 ‖w‖1 < ‖ŵ‖1, max w∈B,[w]j≥0 ‖w‖1 = ‖ŵ‖1+2[ŵ]j+ √ 2p̂G(ŵ,ŝ), if [ŵ]j+ √ 2G(ŵ,ŝ) p̂ >0, ‖ŵ‖1+[ŵ]j+ √ p̂−1 √ 2G(ŵ,ŝ)−[ŵ]2j , otherwise.
115	1	We are now ready to present the second active and inactive screening rule pair AES-2 and IES-2.
116	1	From the lemma above, we can see that the element j with |[ŵ]j | >√ Theorem 5.
117	1	Given a set C ⊆ V̂ and the active and inactive sets Ê and Ĝ identified in the previous IAES steps, then, (i): The active element screening rule takes the form of{ 0 < [ŵ]j ≤ √ 2G(ŵ, ŝ) maxw∈B,[w]j≤0 ‖w‖1 < F̂ (V̂ )− 2F̂ (C) ⇒j ∈ A∗,∀j ∈ V/(Ê ∪ Ĝ).
119	1	(IES-2) (iii): The active and inactive sets Ê and Ĝ can be updated by Ê ← Ê ∪∆Ê , (6) Ĝ ← Ĝ ∪∆Ĝ, (7) where ∆Ê and ∆Ĝ are the newly identified active and inactive sets defined as ∆Ê := { j ∈ V/(Ê ∪ Ĝ) : 0 < [ŵ]j ≤ √ 2G(ŵ, ŝ), max w∈B,[w]j≤0 ‖w‖1 < F̂ (V̂ )− 2F̂ (C) } , ∆Ĝ := { j ∈ V/(Ê ∪ Ĝ) : − √ 2G(ŵ, ŝ) ≤ [ŵ]j < 0, max w∈B,[w]j≥0 ‖w‖1 < F̂ (V̂ )− 2F̂ (C) } .
120	1	Theorem 5 verifies the safety of AES-2 and IES-2.
124	1	As the solver A goes on, the volumes of Ω and B would decrease to zeros quickly, IAES can thus identify more and more inactive and active elements.
129	1	This nice feature can lead to significant speedups in the computation time.
133	1	Although some algorithms only update s, in IAES, we can update w in each iteration by letting w = −s and refining it by the algorithm named pool adjacent violators (Best & Chakravarti, 1990).
134	1	Due to Lemma 1 and the safety of AES-1, AES-2, IES-1 and IES-2, we can see that IAES would never sacrifice any accuracy.
139	3	In our experiment, we set ρ = 0.5 and it achieves a good performance.
150	1	The second measurement is speedup, i.e., the ratio of the running times of the solver without IAES and with IAES.
155	1	We write the code in Matlab and perform all the computations on a single core of Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5930K 3.50GHz, 32GB MEM.
162	1	We perform semi-supervised clustering on each dataset and the objective function F (A) is defined as: F (A) = I(fA, fV/A)− ∑ j∈A log ηj − ∑ j∈V/A log(1− ηj), where I(fA, fV/A) is the mutual information between two Gaussian processes with a Gaussian kernel k(x, y) = exp(−α‖x− y‖2), α = 1.5, and ηj ∈ {0, 1} if j is labeled and otherwise ηj = 12 (see Chapter 6 of (Bach et al., 2013) for more details).
174	1	We use five images (included in the supplemental material) in (Rother et al., 2004) to evaluate IAES.
188	11	In this paper, we proposed a novel safe element screening method IAES for SFM to accelerate its optimization process by simultaneously identifying the active and inactive elements.
189	31	Our major contribution is a novel framework for accurately estimating the optimum of the corresponding primal problem of SFM developed by carefully studying the strong convexity of the primal and dual problems, the structure of the base polyhedra, and the optimality conditions of SFM.
190	148	To the best of our knowledge, IAES is the first screening method in the fields of SFM and even combinatorial optimization.
191	150	The extensive experimental results demonstrate that IAES can achieve significant speedups.
