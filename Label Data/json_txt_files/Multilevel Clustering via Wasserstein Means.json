{"sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "In numerous applications in engineering and sciences, data are often organized in a multilevel structure. For instance, a typical structural view of text data in machine learning is to have words grouped into documents, documents are grouped into corpora. A prominent strand of modeling and algorithmic works in the past couple decades has been to discover latent multilevel structures from these hierarchically structured data. For specific clustering tasks, one may be interested in simultaneously partitioning the data in each group (to obtain local clusters) and partitioning a collection of data groups (to obtain global clusters). Another concrete example is the problem of clustering images (i.e., global clusters) where each image contains partions of multiple annotated regions (i.e., local clusters) (Oliva and Torralba,\n1Department of Statistics, University of Michigan, USA. 2Adobe Research. 3Center for Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics (PRaDA), Deakin University, Australia.

While hierachical clustering techniques may be employed to find a tree-structed clustering given a collection of data points, they are not applicable to discovering the nested structure of multilevel data. Bayesian hierarchical models provide a powerful approach, exemplified by influential works such as (Blei et al., 2003; Pritchard et al., 2000; Teh et al., 2006). More specific to the simultaneous and multilevel clustering problem, we mention the paper of (Rodriguez et al., 2008). In this interesting work, a Bayesian nonparametric model, namely the nested Dirichlet process (NDP) model, was introduced that enables the inference of clustering of a collection of probability distributions from which different groups of data are drawn. With suitable extensions, this modeling framework has been further developed for simultaneous multilevel clustering, see for instance, (Wulsin et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2014; Huynh et al., 2016).\nThe focus of this paper is on the multilevel clustering problem motivated in the aforementioned modeling works, but we shall take a purely optimization approach. We aim to formulate optimization problems that enable the discovery of multilevel clustering structures hidden in grouped data. Our technical approach is inspired by the role of optimal transport distances in hierarchical modeling and clustering problems. The optimal transport distances, also known as Wasserstein distances (Villani, 2003), have been shown to be the natural distance metric for the convergence theory of latent mixing measures arising in both mixture models (Nguyen, 2013) and hierarchical models (Nguyen, 2016). They are also intimately connected to the problem of clustering \u2014 this relationship goes back at least to the work of (Pollard, 1982), where it is pointed out that the well-known K-means clustering algorithm can be directly linked to the quantization problem \u2014 the problem of determining an optimal finite discrete probability measure that minimizes its second-order Wasserstein distance from the empirical distribution of given data (Graf and Luschgy, 2000).\nIf one is to perform simultaneous K-means clustering for hierarchically grouped data, both at the global level (among groups), and local level (within each group), then this can be achieved by a joint optimization problem defined with suitable notions of Wasserstein distances inserted into the objective function. In particular, multilevel clustering requires the optimization in the space of probability mea-\nsures defined in different levels of abstraction, including the space of measures of measures on the space of grouped data. Our goal, therefore, is to formulate this optimization precisely, to develop algorithms for solving the optimization problem efficiently, and to make sense of the obtained solutions in terms of statistical consistency.\nThe algorithms that we propose address directly a multilevel clustering problem formulated from a purely optimization viewpoint, but they may also be taken as a fast approximation to the inference of latent mixing measures that arise in the nested Dirichlet process of (Rodriguez et al., 2008). From a statistical viewpoint, we shall establish a consistency theory for our multilevel clustering problem in the manner achieved for K-means clustering (Pollard, 1982). From a computational viewpoint, quite interestingly, we will be able to explicate and exploit the connection betwen our optimization and that of finding the Wasserstein barycenter (Agueh and Carlier, 2011), an interesting computational problem that have also attracted much recent interests, e.g., (Cuturi and Doucet, 2014).\nIn summary, the main contributions offered in this work include (i) a new optimization formulation to the multilevel clustering problem using Wasserstein distances defined on different levels of the hierarchical data structure; (ii) fast algorithms by exploiting the connection of our formulation to the Wasserstein barycenter problem; (iii) consistency theorems established for proposed estimates under very mild condition of data\u2019s distributions; (iv) several flexibile alternatives by introducing constraints that encourage the borrowing of strength among local and global clusters, and (v) finally, demonstration of efficiency and flexibility of our approach in a number of simulated and real data sets.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides preliminary background on Wasserstein distance, Wasserstein barycenter, and the connection between K-means clustering and the quantization problem. Section 3 presents several optimization formulations of the multilevel clusering problem, and the algorithms for solving them. Section 4 establishes consistency results of the estimators introduced in Section 4. Section 5 presents careful simulation studies with both synthetic and real data. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion in Section 6. Additional technical details, including all proofs, are given in the Supplement."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "For any given subset \u0398 \u2282 Rd, let P(\u0398) denote the space of Borel probability measures on \u0398. The Wasserstein space of order r \u2208 [1,\u221e) of probability measures on \u0398 is de-\nfined as Pr(\u0398) = { G \u2208 P(\u0398) : \u00b4 \u2016x\u2016rdG(x) < \u221e } ,\nwhere \u2016.\u2016 denotes Euclidean metric in Rd. Addition-\nally, for any k \u2265 1 the probability simplex is denoted by \u2206k = { u \u2208 Rk : ui \u2265 0, k\u2211 i=1 ui = 1 } . Finally, let Ok(\u0398) (resp., Ek(\u0398)) be the set of probability measures with at most (resp., exactly) k support points in \u0398.\nWasserstein distances For any elements G and G\u2032 in Pr(\u0398) where r \u2265 1, the Wasserstein distance of order r between G and G\u2032 is defined as (cf. (Villani, 2003)):\nWr(G,G \u2032) = ( inf\n\u03c0\u2208\u03a0(G,G\u2032)\n\u02c6\n\u03982\n\u2016x\u2212 y\u2016rd\u03c0(x, y) )1/r\nwhere \u03a0(G,G\u2032) is the set of all probability measures on \u0398\u00d7\u0398 that have marginalsG andG\u2032. In words,W rr (G,G\u2032) is the optimal cost of moving mass from G to G\u2032, where the cost of moving unit mass is proportional to r-power of Euclidean distance in \u0398. When G and G\u2032 are two discrete measures with finite number of atoms, fast computation of Wr(G,G\n\u2032) can be achieved (see, e.g., (Cuturi, 2013)). The details of this are deferred to the Supplement.\nBy a recursion of concepts, we can speak of measures of measures, and define a suitable distance metric on this abstract space: the space of Borel measures on Pr(\u0398), to be denoted by Pr(Pr(\u0398)). This is also a Polish space (that is, complete and separable metric space) as Pr(\u0398) is a Polish space. It will be endowed with a Wasserstein metric of order r that is induced by a metric Wr on Pr(\u0398) as follows (cf. Section 3 of (Nguyen, 2016)): for any D,D\u2032 \u2208 Pr(Pr(\u0398))\nWr(D,D\u2032) := ( inf \u02c6\nPr(\u0398)2\nW rr (G,G \u2032)d\u03c0(G,G\u2032)\n)1/r\nwhere the infimum in the above ranges over all \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0(D,D\u2032) such that \u03a0(D,D\u2032) is the set of all probability measures on Pr(\u0398)\u00d7Pr(\u0398) that has marginals D and D\u2032. In words, Wr(D,D\u2032) corresponds to the optimal cost of moving mass from D to D\u2032, where the cost of moving unit mass in its space of support Pr(\u0398) is proportional to the r-power of the Wr distance in Pr(\u0398). Note a slight notational abuse \u2014Wr is used for both Pr(\u0398) and Pr(Pr(\u0398)), but it should be clear which one is being used from context.\nWasserstein barycenter Next, we present a brief overview of Wasserstein barycenter problem, first studied by (Agueh and Carlier, 2011) and subsequentially many others (e.g., (Benamou et al., 2015; Solomon et al., 2015; A\u0301lvarez Estebana et al., 2016)). Given probability measures P1, P2, . . . , PN \u2208 P2(\u0398) for N \u2265 1, their Wasserstein barycenter PN,\u03bb is such that\nPN,\u03bb = arg min P\u2208P2(\u0398) N\u2211 i=1 \u03bbiW 2 2 (P, Pi) (1)\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 \u2206N denote weights associated with P1, . . . , PN . When P1, . . . , PN are discrete measures with finite number of atoms and the weights \u03bb are uniform, it was shown by (Anderes et al., 2015) that the problem of finding Wasserstein barycenter PN,\u03bb over the space P2(\u0398) in (1) is reduced to search only over a much simpler space\nOl(\u0398) where l = N\u2211 i=1 si \u2212N + 1 and si is the number of components of Pi for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N . Efficient algorithms for finding local solutions of the Wasserstein barycenter problem over Ok(\u0398) for some k \u2265 1 have been studied recently in (Cuturi and Doucet, 2014). These algorithms will prove to be a useful building block for our method as we shall describe in the sequel. The notion of Wasserstein barycenter has been utilized for approximate Bayesian inference (Srivastava et al., 2015).\nK-means as quantization problem The well-known Kmeans clustering algorithm can be viewed as solving an optimization problem that arises in the problem of quantization, a simple but very useful connection (Pollard, 1982; Graf and Luschgy, 2000). The connection is the following. Given n unlabelled samples Y1, . . . , Yn \u2208 \u0398. Assume that these data are associated with at most k clusters where k \u2265 1 is some given number. The K-means problem finds the set S containing at most k elements \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8k \u2208 \u0398 that minimizes the following objective\ninf S:|S|\u2264k\n1\nn n\u2211 i=1 d2(Yi, S). (2)\nLet Pn = 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 \u03b4Yi be the empirical measure of data\nY1, . . . , Yn. Then, problem (2) is equivalent to finding a discrete probability measure G which has finite number of support points and solves:\ninf G\u2208Ok(\u0398)\nW 22 (G,Pn). (3)\nDue to the inclusion of Wasserstein metric in its formulation, we call this a Wasserstein means problem. This problem can be further thought of as a Wasserstein barycenter problem where N = 1. In light of this observation, as noted by (Cuturi and Doucet, 2014), the algorithm for finding the Wasserstein barycenter offers an alternative for the popular Loyd\u2019s algorithm for determing local minimum of the K-means objective."}, {"heading": "3.

We want to obtain simultaneously local clusters for each data group, and global clusters among all groups."}, {"heading": "3.1. Multilevel Wasserstein Means (MWM) Algorithm", "text": "For any j = 1, . . . ,m, we denote the empirical measure for group j by P jnj := 1\nnj nj\u2211 i=1 \u03b4Xj,i . Throughout this sec-\ntion, for simplicity of exposition we assume that the number of both local and global clusters are either known or bounded above by a given number. In particular, for local clustering we allow group j to have at most kj clusters for j = 1, . . . ,m. For global clustering, we assume to have M group (Wasserstein) means among the m given groups.\nHigh level idea For local clustering, for each j = 1, . . . ,m, performing a K-means clustering for group j, as expressed by (3), can be viewed as finding a finite discrete measure Gj \u2208 Okj (\u0398) that minimizes squared Wasserstein distance W 22 (Gj , P j nj ). For global clustering, we are interested in obtaining clusters out of m groups, each of which is now represented by the discrete measure Gj , for j = 1, . . . ,m. Adopting again the viewpoint of Eq. (3), provided that all of Gjs are given, we can apply K-means quantization method to find their distributional clusters. The global clustering in the space of measures of measures on \u0398 can be succintly expressed by\ninf H\u2208EM (P2(\u0398))\nW 22\n( H, 1\nm m\u2211 j=1 \u03b4Gj ) .\nHowever, Gj are not known \u2014 they have to be optimized through local clustering in each data group.\nMWM problem formulation We have arrived at an objective function for jointly optimizing over both local and global clusters\ninf Gj\u2208Okj (\u0398), H\u2208EM (P2(\u0398))\nm\u2211 j=1 W 22 (Gj , P j nj ) +W 2 2 (H, 1 m m\u2211 j=1 \u03b4Gj ). (4)\nWe call the above optimization the problem of Multilevel Wasserstein Means (MWM). The notable feature of MWM is that its loss function consists of two types of distances associated with the hierarchical data structure: one is distance in the space of measures, e.g., W 22 (Gj , P j nj ), and the other in space of measures of measures, e.g., W 22 (H, 1\nm m\u2211 j=1 \u03b4Gj ). By adopting K-means optimization to\nboth local and global clustering, the multilevel Wasserstein means problem might look formidable at the first sight. Fortunately, it is possible to simplify this original formulation substantially, by exploiting the structure ofH.\nIndeed, we can show that formulation (4) is equivalent to the following optimization problem, which looks much simpler as it involves only measures on \u0398:\ninf Gj\u2208Okj (\u0398),H m\u2211 j=1 W 22 (Gj , P j nj ) + d2W2(Gj ,H) m (5)\nwhere d2W2(G,H) := min1\u2264i\u2264M W 22 (G,Hi) and H = (H1, . . . ,HM ), with each Hi \u2208 P2(\u0398). The proof of this equivalence is deferred to Proposition B.4 in the Supplement. Before going into to the details of the algorithm for solving (5) in Section 3.1.2, we shall present some simpler cases, which help to illustrate some properties of the optimal solutions of (5), while providing insights of subsequent developments of the MWM formulation. Readers may proceed directly to Section 3.1.2 for the description of the algorithm in the first reading."}, {"heading": "3.1.1. PROPERTIES OF MWM IN SPECIAL CASES", "text": "Example 1. Suppose kj = 1 and nj = n for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, and M = 1. Write H = H \u2208 P2(\u0398).

From the result of Theorem A.1 in the Supplement,\ninf \u03b8j\u2208\u0398 m\u2211 j=1 W 22 (\u03b4\u03b8j , H) \u2265 inf H\u2208E1(\u0398) m\u2211 j=1 W 22 (Gj , H)\n= m\u2211 j=1 \u2016\u03b8j \u2212 ( m\u2211 i=1 \u03b8i)/m\u20162,\nwhere second infimum is achieved when H = \u03b4 ( m\u2211 j=1 \u03b8j)/m . Thus, objective function (6) may be rewritten as\ninf \u03b8j\u2208\u0398 m\u2211 j=1 n\u2211 i=1 \u2016\u03b8j \u2212Xj,i\u20162 + \u2016m\u03b8j \u2212 ( m\u2211 l=1 \u03b8l)\u20162/m3. Write Xj = ( n\u2211 i=1 Xj,i)/n for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. As m \u2265 2, we can check that the unique optimal solutions for the\nabove optimization problem are \u03b8j = (\n(m2n + 1)Xj +\u2211 i 6=j Xi ) /(m2n + m) for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. If we further assume that our dataXj,i are i.i.d samples from probability measure P j having mean \u00b5j = EX\u223cP j (X) for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, the previous result implies that \u03b8i 6\u2192 \u03b8j for almost surely as long as \u00b5i 6= \u00b5j . As a consequence, if \u00b5j are pairwise different, the multi-level Wasserstein means under that simple scenario of (5) will not have identical centers among local groups. On the other hand, we have W 22 (Gi, Gj) = \u2016\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j\u20162 =( mn\nmn+ 1\n)2 \u2016Xi \u2212 Xj\u20162.

It implies that as long as W 22 (P i n, P j n) is small, the optimal solutionGi andGj of (6) will be sufficiently close to each other. By letting n\u2192\u221e, we also achieve the same conclusion regarding the asymptotic behavior of Gi and Gj with respect to W2(P i, P j).\nExample 2. kj = 1 and nj = n for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m and M = 2. Write H = (H1, H2). Moreover, assume that there is a strict subset A of {1, 2, . . . ,m} such that\nmax { max i,j\u2208A W2(P i n, P j n),\nmax i,j\u2208Ac\nW2(P i n, P j n)\n} min\ni\u2208A,j\u2208Ac W2(P\ni n, P j n),\ni.e., the distances of empirical measures P in and P j n when i and j belong to the same set A or Ac are much less than those when i and j do not belong to the same set. Under this condition, by using the argument from part (i) we can write the objective function (5) as\ninf \u03b8j\u2208\u0398,\nH1\u2208P2(\u0398)\n\u2211 j\u2208A n\u2211 i=1 \u2016\u03b8j \u2212Xj,i\u20162 + W 22 (\u03b4\u03b8j , H1) |A| +\ninf \u03b8j\u2208\u0398,\nH2\u2208P2(\u0398)\n\u2211 j\u2208Ac n\u2211 i=1 \u2016\u03b8j \u2212Xj,i\u20162 + W 22 (\u03b4\u03b8j , H2) |Ac| .\nThe above objective function suggests that the optimal solutions \u03b8i, \u03b8j (equivalently, Gi and Gj) will not be close to each other as long as i and j do not belong to the same set A or Ac, i.e., P in and P j n are very far. Therefore, the two groups of \u201clocal\u201d measures Gj do not share atoms under that setting of empirical measures.\nThe examples examined above indicate that the MWM problem in general do not \u201cencourage\u201d the local measures Gj to share atoms among each other in its solution. Additionally, when the empirical measures of local groups are very close, it may also suggest that they belong to the same cluster and the distances among optimal local measures Gj can be very small."}, {"heading": "3.1.2.

Define the following functions fn(G,H) = m\u2211 j=1 W 22 (Gj , P j nj ) +W 2 2 (H, 1 m m\u2211 j=1 \u03b4Gj ),\nf(G,H) = m\u2211 j=1 W 22 (Gj , P j) +W 22 (H, 1 m m\u2211 j=1 \u03b4Gj ),\nwhere Gj \u2208 Okj (\u0398), H \u2208 EM (P(\u0398)) as 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. The first consistency property of the WMW formulation:\nTheorem 4.1. Given that P j \u2208 P2(\u0398) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Then, there holds almost surely, as n\u2192\u221e\ninf Gj\u2208Okj (\u0398), H\u2208EM (P2(\u0398)) fn(G,H)\u2212 inf Gj\u2208Okj (\u0398), H\u2208EM (P2(\u0398)) f(G,H)\u2192 0.\nThe next theorem establishes that the \u201ctrue\u201d global and local clusters can be recovered. To this end, assume that for each n there is an optimal solution (G\u0302n11 , . . . , G\u0302 nm m , H\u0302n) or in short (G\u0302 n ,Hn) of the objective function (4). Moreover, there exist a (not necessarily unique) optimal solution minimizing f(G,H) overGj \u2208 Okj (\u0398) andH \u2208 EM (P2(\u0398)). Let F be the collection of such optimal solutions. For any Gj \u2208 Okj (\u0398) andH \u2208 EM (P2(\u0398)), define\nd(G,H,F) = inf (G0,H0)\u2208F m\u2211 j=1 W 22 (Gj , G 0 j ) +W 2 2 (H,H0).\nGiven the above assumptions, we have the following result regarding the convergence of (G\u0302 n ,Hn):\nTheorem 4.2. Assume that \u0398 is bounded and P j \u2208 P2(\u0398) for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Then, we have d(G\u0302 n , H\u0302n,F) \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e almost surely.\nRemark: (i) The assumption \u0398 is bounded is just for the convenience of proof argument. We believe that the conclusion of this theorem may still hold when \u0398 = Rd. (ii) If |F| = 1, i.e., there exists an unique optimal solution G0,H0 minimizing f(G,H) over Gj \u2208 Okj (\u0398) and H \u2208 EM (P2(\u0398)), the result of Theorem 4.2 implies that W2(G\u0302 nj j , G 0 j ) \u2192 0 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m and W2(H\u0302n,H0) \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e."}, {"heading": "5. Empirical studies", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1. Synthetic data", "text": "In this section, we are interested in evaluating the effectiveness of both MWM and MWMS clustering algorithms by considering different synthetic data generating processes. Unless otherwise specified, we set the number of groups m = 50, number of observations per group nj = 50 in d = 10 dimensions, number of global clusters M = 5 with 6 atoms. For Algorithm 1 (MWM) local measures Gj have 5 atoms each; for Algorithm 2 (MWMS) number of atoms in constraint set SK is 50. As a benchmark for the comparison we will use a basic 3-stage K-means approach (the details of which can be found in the Supplement). The Wasserstein distance between the estimated distributions (i.e. G\u03021, . . . , G\u0302m; H\u03021, . . . , H\u0302M ) and the data generating ones will be used as the comparison metric.\nRecall that the MWM formulation does not impose constraints on the atoms of Gi, while the MWMS formulation explicitly enforces the sharing of atoms across these measures. We used multiple layers of mixtures while adding Gaussian noise at each layer to generate global and local clusters and the no-constraint (NC) data. We varied number of groups m from 500 to 10000. We notice that the 3-stage K-means algorithm performs the best when there is no constraint structure and variance is constant across clusters (Fig. 1(a) and 2(a)) \u2014 this is, not surprisingly, a favorable setting for the basic K-means method. As soon as we depart from the (unrealistic) constant-variance, no-sharing assumption, both of our algorithms start to outperform the basic three-stage K-means. The superior performance is most pronounced with local-constraint (LC) data (with or without constant variance conditions). See Fig. 1(c,d). It is worth noting that even when group variances are constant, the 3-stage K-means is no longer longer effective because now fails to account for the shared structure. Whenm = 50 and group sizes are larger, we set SK = 15. Results are reported in Fig. 2 (c), (d). These results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our both algorithms."}, {"heading": "5.2. Real data analysis", "text": "We applied our multilevel clustering algorithms to two realworld datasets: LabelMe and StudentLife.\nLabelMe dataset consists of 2, 688 annotated images which are classified into 8 scene categories including tall buildings, inside city, street, highway, coast, open country, mountain, and forest (Oliva and Torralba, 2001) . Each image contains multiple annotated regions. Each region, which is annotated by users, represents an object in the image. As shown in Figure 4, the left image is an image from open country category and contains 4 regions while the right panel denotes an image of tall buildings category\nincluding 16 regions. Note that the regions in each image can be overlapped. We remove the images containing less then 4 regions and obtain 1, 800 images.\nWe then extract GIST feature (Oliva and Torralba, 2001) for each region in a image. GIST is a visual descriptor to represent perceptual dimensions and oriented spatial structures of a scene. Each GIST descriptor is a 512- dimensional vector. We further use PCA to project GIST features into 30 dimensions. Finally, we obtain 1, 800 \u201cdocuments\u201d, each of which contains regions as observations. Each region now is represented by a 30-dimensional vector. We now can perform clustering regions in every image since they are visually correlated. In the next level of clustering, we can cluster images into scene categories.\nStudentLife dataset is a large dataset frequently used in pervasive and ubiquitous computing research. Data signals\nconsist of multiple channels (e.g., WiFi signals, Bluetooth scan, etc.), which are collected from smartphones of 49 students at Dartmouth College over a 10-week spring term in 2013. However, in our experiments, we use only WiFi signal strengths. We applied a similar procedure described in (Nguyen et al., 2016) to pre-process the data. We aggregate the number of scans by each Wifi access point and select 500 Wifi Ids with the highest frequencies. Eventually, we obtain 49 \u201cdocuments\u201d with totally approximately 4.6 million 500-dimensional data points.\nExperimental results. To quantitatively evaluate our proposed methods, we compare our algorithms with several base-line methods: K-means, three-stage K-means (TSKmeans) as described in the Supplement, MC2-SVI without context (Huynh et al., 2016). Clustering performance in Table 1 is evaluated with the image clustering problem for LabelMe dataset. With K-means, we average all data points\nto obtain a single vector for each images. K-means needs much less time to run since the number of data points is now reduced to 1, 800. For MC2-SVI, we used stochastic varitational and a parallelized Spark-based implementation in (Huynh et al., 2016) to carry out experiments. This implementation has the advantage of making use of all of 16 cores on the test machine. The running time for MC2-SVI is reported after scanning one epoch. In terms of clustering accuracy, MWM and MWMS algorithms perform the best.\nFig. 3a demonstrates five representative image clusters with six randomly chosen images in each (on the right) which are discovered by our MWMS algorithm. We also accumulate labeled tags from all images in each cluster to produce the tag-cloud on the left. These tag-clouds can be considered as visual ground truth of clusters. Our algorithm can group images into clusters which are consistent with their tag-clouds.\nWe use StudentLife dataset to demonstrate the capability of multilevel clustering with large-scale datasets. This dataset not only contains a large number of data points but presents in high dimension. Our algorithms need approximately 1 hour to perform multilevel clustering on this dataset. Fig. 3b presents two levels of clusters discovered by our algorithms. The innermost (blue) and outermost (green) rings depict local and global clusters respectively. Global clusters represent groups of students while local clusters shared between students (\u201cdocuments\u201d) may be used to infer loca-\ntions of students\u2019 activities. From these clusteing we can dissect students\u2019 shared location (activities), e.g. Student 49 (U49) mainly takes part in activity location 4 (L4)."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion", "text": "We have proposed an optimization based approach to multilevel clustering using Wasserstein metrics. There are several possible directions for extensions. Firstly, we have only considered continuous data; it is of interest to extend our formulation to discrete data. Secondly, our method requires knowledge of the numbers of clusters both in local and global clustering. When these numbers are unknown, it seems reasonable to incorporate penalty on the model complexity. Thirdly, our formulation does not directly account for the \u201cnoise\u201d distribution away from the (Wasserstein) means. To improve the robustness, it may be desirable to make use of the first-order Wasserstein metric instead of the second-order one. Finally, we are interested in extending our approach to richer settings of hierarchical data, such as one when group level-context is available.\nAcknowledgement.
