1	14	Despite their long history, there is a recent hype about chatbots in both, the scientific community (cf.
2	20	e.g. Ferrara et al. (2016)) and industry (Gartner, 2016).
4	11	• Advances in machine learning (ML) • Natural Language Understanding (NLU) as a service In this paper, we focus on the latter.
7	106	With this paper, we want to bridge this gap and enable both, researchers and companies, to make more educated decisions about which service they should use.
23	35	In order to understand the role of NLU services for chatbots, one first has to look at the general architecture of chatbots.
28	58	In the context of Request Interpretation, a “request” is not necessarily a question, but can also be any user input like “My name is John”.
29	170	Equally, a “response” to this input could e.g. be “What a nice name”.
30	53	The general goal of NLU services is the extraction of structured, semantic information from unstructured natural language input, e.g. chat messages.
32	13	At the time of writing, among the most popular NLU services are: • LUIS1 • Watson Conversation2 • API.ai3 • wit.ai4 • Amazon Lex5 Moreover, there is a popular open source alternative which is called RASA6.
34	15	On the other hand, it offers the typical advantages of self-hosted open source software (adaptability, data control, etc).
36	69	All of them, except for Amazon Lex, share the same basic concept: Based on example data, the user can train a classifier to classify so-called intents (which represent the intent of the whole message and are not bound to a certain position within the message) and entities (which can consist of a single or multiple characters).
37	20	Figure 2 shows a labelled sentence in the LUIS web interface.
41	47	Moreover, all services, except for Amazon Lex, also offer an export and import functionality which uses a json-format to export and import the training data.
46	18	Our evaluation is based on two very different data corpora.
62	18	For the generation of the StackExchange corpus, we used the StackExchange Data Explorer12.
63	38	We choose the most popular questions (i.e. questions with the highest scores and most views), from the two StackExchange platforms ask ubuntu and Web Applications, because they are likely to have a better linguistic quality and a higher relevance, compared to less popular questions.
65	24	Although we did not use the answers in our evaluation, we included them in our corpus, in order to create a corpus that is not only useful for this particular evaluation, but also for research on question answering in general.
67	31	The corpus was labelled with intents and entities using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).
103	15	The commercial products will (overall) perform better: The initial language model of RASA, which comes with MITIE, is about 300 MB of data.
105	21	We, therefore, assume, that the commercial products will perform better in the evaluation, especially when the training data is sparse.
120	20	The detailed results of the evaluation, broken down on single intents, entity types, corpora, and overall, are shown in Table 5 to 8.
130	56	Similarly, API.ai performed worst on every dataset, while the second place changes between RASA and Watson Conversation (cf.
139	15	LUIS always performs best, independent from the domain, API.ai always worst, also independent from the domain, merely the second and third place changes.
141	47	On a more detailed level, we also see differences between entities and intents.
143	46	On the web apps corpus, for example, API.ai did not identify a single occurrence of the entity type WebService, which occurred 64 times in the dataset.
145	14	The overall results of API.ai were therefore heavily influenced by its shortcomings regarding entity detection.
146	223	If we look at intents and entity types with sparse training data, like Line, ChangePassword, and ExportData, other than we expected, we do not see a significantly better performance of commercial services.
147	47	The evaluation of the NLU services LUIS, Watson Conversation, API.ai, and RASA, based on the two corpora we presented in Section 5, has shown that the quality of the annotations differs between the different services.
148	86	Before using an NLU service, no matter if for commercial or scientific purposes, one should therefore compare the different services with domain specific data.
149	17	For our two corpora, LUIS showed the best results, however, the open source alternative RASA could achieve similar results.
