21	1	7, and raise some interesting sociolinguistic questions for future studies.
27	1	Apart from association between such conversational contexts and language preference, language alteration is often found to be used as a signaling device to imply certain pragmatic functions (Barredo, 1997; Sanchez, 1983; Nishimura, 1995; Maschler, 1991; Maschler, 1994) such as: (a) reported speech (b) narrative to evaluative switch (c) reiterations or emphasis (d) topic shift (e) puns and language play (f) topic/comment structuring etc.
29	1	However, linguists agree that language alteration in multilingual communities is not a random process.
32	1	Dewaele argues that emotionally charged words in L1 elicit stronger emotions than those in other languages, and hence L1 is preferred for emotion expression.
41	1	While there has been some effort towards computational processing of CS text (Solorio and Liu, 2008; Solorio and Liu, 2010; Vyas et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2014), to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study on automatic identification of functional aspects of CS or any large-scale, data-driven study of language preference.
42	1	The current study adds to the growing repertoire of work on quantitative analysis of social media data for understanding socio-linguistic and pragmatic issues, such as detection of depression (De Choudhury et al., 2013), politeness (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013), speech acts (Vosoughi and Roy, 2016), and social status (Tchokni et al., 2014).
48	1	t|T |} be a set of tweets (or any text) generated by Hi-En bilinguals.
63	1	Let mhr(T ) and mer(T ) respectively denote the set of Hi and En fragments in mr(T ).
69	1	Let this fraction be pr(h ↔ e ′;mr(T )).
71	1	However, if pr(h ↔ ′;mr(T )) is significantly higher than pr(h ′ ↔ e ;mr(T )), it means that speakers prefer to switch from English to Hindi when they want to express a sentiment and vice versa.
75	1	Under such a situation, the likelihoods cannot be considered as true test statistics, and consequently, hypothesis testing cannot be done per se.
76	1	Nevertheless, we can use these as descriptive statistics and investigate the status of the aforementioned hypotheses.
78	1	In this paper, we use tweets in Devanagari script Hindi (hd), and Roman script English (er), Hindi (hr) and Hi-En Mixed (mr).
79	1	English and mixed tweets written in Devanagari are extremely rare (Bali et al., 2014) and we do not study them here.
83	1	TBL: Tweets from users who are certainly Hi-En bilinguals, which are approximately 55% (240,000) of the tweets in TAll.
98	1	For generalizability of our observations, it is important to ensure that the tweets in TAll come from a large number of users and the datasets do not over-represent a small set of users.
101	1	As expected, we do observe a powerlaw-like distribution, where a few users contribute a large number of tweets, and a large number of users contribute a few tweets each.
105	1	Hence, most observations from these corpora are expected to be representative of the average online linguistic behavior of a Hi-En bilingual.
112	1	Most of the existing research in opinion detection (Qadir, 2009; Brun, 2012; Rajkumar et al., 2014) and sentiment analysis (Mohammad, 2012; Mohammad et al., 2013; Mittal et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2015) focus on monolingual tweets and sentences.
116	1	We first identify whether a tweet is opinionated or nonopinionated (⊗).
120	1	We develop individual classifiers for each language class (er, hr, hd, mr) using an SVM with RBF kernel from Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
125	1	We Romanize the hd lexicon for the hr classifiers (ii) Elongated words: Words with one character repeated more than two times, e.g. sooo, naaahhhhi (iii) Exclamations: Presence of contiguous exclamation marks (iv) Emoticons4 (v) Question marks: Queries are generally nonopinionated.
131	1	(xiii) Twitter user mentions (xiv) Pronouns: Opinion is often in first person using pronouns like I and we.
182	1	3), we can estimate the preference, if any, for switching to a particular language while changing the sentiment.
191	1	The extremely high value for these ratios is an evidence for a strong preference towards switching language from English to Hindi while switching to negative sentiment (and switching to English when sentiment changes from negative to positive).
210	2	Or is it because Hindi is specifically preferred for swearing and therefore, is the language of preference for negative emotion?
211	3	How do such preferences vary across topics, users and other multilingual communities?
212	19	How representative of the society is this kind of social media study?
213	119	We plan to explore some of these questions in the future.
214	121	Our study also indicates that inferences drawn on multilingual societies by analyzing data in just one language (usually English), which has been the norm so far, are likely to be incorrect.
