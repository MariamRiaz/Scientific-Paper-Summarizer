"Dependency parsing is a longstanding natural language processing task, with its outputs crucial to various downstream tasks including relation extraction (Schmitz et al., 2012; Angeli et al., 2015), language modeling (Gubbins and Vlachos, 2013), and natural logic inference (Bowman et al., 2016).

We show that arc-swift parsers reduce errors in attaching prepositional phrases and conjunctions compared to parsers using existing transition systems.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Transition-based dependency parsing is performed by predicting transitions between states (see Figure 1 for an example).,2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Parser states are usually written as (σ|i, j|β,A), where σ|i denotes the stack with token i on the top, j|β denotes the buffer with token j at its leftmost, and A the set of dependency arcs.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[1.0],"['Parser states are usually written as (σ|i, j|β,A), where σ|i denotes the stack with token i on the top, j|β denotes the buffer with token j at its leftmost, and A the set of dependency arcs.']"
"Given a state, the goal of a dependency parser is to predict a transition to a new state that would lead to the correct parse.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[1.0],"['Given a state, the goal of a dependency parser is to predict a transition to a new state that would lead to the correct parse.']"
"A transition system defines a set of transitions that are sound and complete for parsers, that is, every transition sequence would derive a well-formed parse tree, and every possible parse tree can also be derived from some transition sequence.1
Arc-standard (Nivre, 2004) is one of the first transition systems proposed for dependency parsing.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0.999999934712731],"['A transition system defines a set of transitions that are sound and complete for parsers, that is, every transition sequence would derive a well-formed parse tree, and every possible parse tree can also be derived from some transition sequence.1 Arc-standard (Nivre, 2004) is one of the first transition systems proposed for dependency parsing.']"

"This system builds the parse bottom-up, i.e., a constituent is only attached to its head after it has received all of its dependents.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"A potential drawback is that during parsing, it is difficult to predict if a constituent has consumed all of its right dependents.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Arc-eager (Nivre, 2003) remedies this drawback by defining arc-inducing transitions that operate between the stack and the buffer.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]

"Arc-hybrid combines LArc from arc-eager and RArc from arc-standard to build dependencies bottom-up.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"3 Non-local Transitions with arc-swift
The traditional transition systems discussed in Section 2 only allow very local transitions affecting one or two words, which makes long-distance dependencies difficult to predict.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"To illustrate the limitation of local transitions, consider parsing the following sentences:
I ate fish with ketchup.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0.9999999648207467],"['To illustrate the limitation of local transitions, consider parsing the following sentences: I ate fish with ketchup.']"
"I ate fish with chopsticks.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"The two sentences have almost identical structures, with the notable difference that the prepositional phrase is complementing the direct object in the first case, and the main verb in the second.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[1.0000000174644186],"['The two sentences have almost identical structures, with the notable difference that the prepositional phrase is complementing the direct object in the first case, and the main verb in the second.']"
"For arc-standard and arc-hybrid, the parser would have to decide between Shift and RArc when the parser state is as shown in Figure 3a, where ? stands for either “ketchup” or “chopsticks”.3 Similarly, an arc-eager parser would deal with the state shown in Figure 3b.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Making the correct transition requires information about context words “ate” and “fish”, as well as “?”.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0.9999999519235193],"['Making the correct transition requires information about context words “ate” and “fish”, as well as “?”.']"
2A side-effect of arc-eager is that there is sometimes spurious ambiguity between Shift and Reduce transitions.,2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"For the example in Figure 1, the first Reduce can be inserted before the third Shift without changing the correctness of the resulting parse, i.e., both are feasible at that time.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"3For this example, we assume that the sentence is being parsed into Universal Dependencies.

"Parsers employing traditional transition systems would usually incorporate more features about the context in the transition decision, or employ beam search during parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Andor et al., 2016).

"This allows direct comparison of different attachment points, and provides a direct solution to parsing the two example sentences.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[1.0],"['This allows direct comparison of different attachment points, and provides a direct solution to parsing the two example sentences.']"
"When the arc-swift parser encounters a state identical to Figure 3b, it could directly compare transitions RArc[1] and RArc[2] instead of evaluating between local transitions.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"This results in a direct attachment much like that in a graph-based parser, informed by lexical information about affinity of the pairs of words.
",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
Arc-swift also bears much resemblance to arceager.,2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"In fact, an LArc[k] transition can be viewed as k− 1 Reduce operations followed by one LArc in arc-eager, and similarly for RArc[k].",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Reduce is no longer needed in arc-swift as it becomes part of LArc[k] and RArc[k], removing the ambiguity in derived transitions in arc-eager.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"arc-swift is also equivalent to arc-eager in terms of soundness and completeness.4 A caveat is that the worst-case time complexity of arc-swift is O(n2) instead of O(n), which existing transition-based parsers enjoy.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"However, in practice the runtime is nearly
4This is easy to show because in arc-eager, all Reduce transitions can be viewed as preparing for a later LArc or RArc transition.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"We also note that similar to arc-eager transitions, arc-swift transitions must also satisfy certain pre-conditions.",2 Transition-based Dependency Parsing,[0],[0]
"Specifically, an RArc[k] transition requires that the top k − 1 elements in the stack are already attached; LArc[k] additionally requires that the k-th element is unattached, resulting in no more than one feasible LArc candidate for any parser state.

Previous work has also explored augmenting transition systems to facilitate longer-range attachments.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Attardi (2006) extended the arcstandard system for non-projective parsing, with arc-inducing transitions that are very similar to those in arc-swift.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
A notable difference is that their transitions retain tokens between the head and dependent.,5 Related Work,[0],[0]

"While this work shares very similar motivations as arc-swift, it requires additional data structures to keep track of the left and right spines of nodes.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]

"For a comprehensive study of transition systems for dependency parsing, we refer the reader to (Bohnet et al., 2016), which proposed a generalized framework that could derive all of the traditional transition systems we described by configuring the size of the active token set and the maximum arc length, among other control parameters.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, this framework does not cover
arc-swift in its original form, as the authors limit each of their transitions to reduce at most one token from the active token set (the buffer).",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the framework presented in (GómezRodrı́guez and Nivre, 2013) does not explicitly make this constraint, and therefore generalizes to arc-swift.",5 Related Work,[0],[0]
