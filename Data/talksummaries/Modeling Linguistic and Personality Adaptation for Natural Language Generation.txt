6	18	We posit that it is crucial to enable adaptation in computer agents in order to make them more human-like.
10	20	Therefore we propose a novel adaptation measure, Dialog Adaptation Score (DAS), which can model adaptation on any subset of linguistic features and can be applied on a turn by turn basis to any segment of dialog.
12	27	A response (target) with no adaptation makes the utterance stiff (DAS = 0), and too much adaptation (to all four discourse markers in prime, DAS = 1) makes the utterance unnatural.
14	22	Conversants in dialogs express their own personality and adapt to their dialog partners simultaneously.
15	36	Our measure of adaptation produces models for adaptive natural language generation (NLG) for dialogs that integrates the predictions of both personality theories and adaptation theories.
17	26	Context: okay alright so yeah Im looking at 123 Locust right now Linguistic Features: Discourse markers: okay, alright, so, yeah Referring expressions: 123 Locust Syntactic structures: VP->VBP+VP, VP->VBG+PP+ADVB ... We apply our method to multiple corpora to investigate how the dialog situation and speaker roles affect the level and type of adaptation to the other speaker.
20	35	Our first aim therefore is a measure of dialog adaptation that can be applied on a turn by turn basis as a dialog unfolds.
21	37	For this purpose, previous measures of dialog adaptation (Stenchikova and Stent, 2007; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011) have two limitations: (1) their calculation require the complete dialog, and (2) they focus on single features and do not provide a model to control the interaction of multiple parameters in a single output, while our method measures adaptation with respect to any set of features.
24	24	While linguistic adaptation occur beyond the next turn, we simplify the calculation by using a window size of 1 for most experiments: for every utterance in the dialog (prime), we consider the next utterance by a different speaker as the target, if any.
27	78	In the following definition, FCi(p) is the count of features in prime p of the i-th (p, t) pair, n is the total number of prime-target pairs in which FCi(p) 6= 0, similarly, FCi(p ∧ t) is the count of features in both prime p and target t. We define Dialog Adaptation Score (DAS) as: DAS = 1 n n∑ i=1 FCi(p ∧ t) FCi(p) Within a feature set, DAS reflects the average probability that features in prime are adapted in target across all prime-target pairs in a dialog.
47	16	We hypothesize that different conversational contexts may lead to more or less adaptive behavior, so we apply DAS on four human-human dialog corpora: two task-oriented dialog corpora that were designed to elicit adaptation (ArtWalk and Walking Around), one topic-centric spontaneous dialog corpus (Switchboard), and the MapTask Corpus used in much previous work.
61	21	It includes referent negotiation, direction-giving, and small talk (non-task talk).2 Walking Around Corpus (WAC).3 The Walking Around Corpus (Brennan et al., 2013) consists of spontaneous spoken dialogs produced by 36 pairs of people, collected in order to elicit adaptation behaviors, as illustrated by Figure 2.
67	18	Map Task Corpus (MPT).4 The Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) is a set of 128 cooperative task-oriented dialogs involving two participants.
83	44	Figure 4 illustrates how the SWBD dialogs are often lopsided: from utterance 14 to 18, speaker B states his opinion with verbose dialog turns, whereas speaker A only acknowledges and backchannels; from utterance 19 to 22, speaker A acts as the main speaker, whereas speaker B backchannels.
84	30	Some theories of discourse define dialog turns as extending over backchannels, and we posit that this would allow us to measure adaptation more faithfully, so we utilize the SWBD dialog act tags to filter turns that only contain backchannels, keeping only dialog turns with tags sd (Statement-nonopinion), sv (Statement-opinion), and bf (Summarize/reformulate).6 We then merge consecutive dialog turns from the same speaker.
105	45	Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (Pennebaker et al., 2001) is a text analysis program that counts words in over 80 linguistic (e.g., pronouns, conjunctions), psychological (e.g., anger, positive emotion), and topical (e.g., leisure, money) categories.
111	20	We first establish that our novel DAS measure is valid by testing whether it can distinguish dialogs in their original order vs. dialogs with randomly scrambled turns (the order of dialog turns are randomized within speakers), inspired by similar approaches in previous work (Gandhe and Traum, 2008; Ward and Litman, 2007; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005).
128	21	Comparing columns, we first examine the DAS scores across different corpora.
141	22	We posit that the DAS adaptation models we present can be used in existing NLG architectures, described in Sec.
145	17	While other linguistic features are largely content-specific, LIWC consists of higher level features that cover broader categories, thus its high DAS scores are expected.
150	36	Our primary goal is to model adaptation at a finegrained level in order to provide fine-grained control of an NLG engine.
152	15	Reliable discourse segmentation is notoriously difficult (Passonneau and Litman, 1996), thus we heuristically divide each task-oriented dialog into segments based on number of destinations on the map: this effectively divides the dialog into subtasks.
153	15	Since each dialog in SWBD only has one topic, we divide SWBD into 5 segments.7 We compute DAS for each segment, and take an average across all dialogs in the corpus for each segment.
159	20	5(b)), despite being a subset of all LIWC features.8 Average DAS displays the same decreasing trend in all and extraversion LIWC features for SWBD (Fig.
163	25	We use target=Both, target=D, and target=F to calculate DAS for each target.9 We hypothesize that directors and followers adapt differently in task-oriented dialogs.
174	108	In SWBD, D stands for the speaker initiating the call.
175	25	Results show that DAS scores for the original dialogs in all corpora decrease as window size increases, while DAS scores for the randomized dialogs stay relatively stable.
177	39	Plots of the AWC and WAC show similar trends.
199	82	To obtain models of linguistic adaptation, most measures could only measure an individual feature at a time, and need the whole dialog to calculate the measure (Church, 2000; Stenchikova and Stent, 2007; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Pietsch et al., 2012; Reitter et al., 2006b; Ward and Litman, 2007).
205	20	We leave to future work the implementation and evaluation of DAS adaptation models in natural language generation systems.
