{"sections": [{"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "KDE (Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962) is a foundational aspect of nonparametric statistics. It is a powerful method to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. Moreover, it is simple to compute and has played a significant role in a very wide range of practical applications. Its convergence properties have been studied for a long time with most of the work dedicated to its asymptotic behavior or mean-squared risk (Tsybakov, 2008). However, there is still a surprising amount not yet fully understood about its convergence behavior. In this paper, we focus on the uniform finite-sample facet of KDE convergence theory. We handle the multivariate KDE setting in Rd which allows a d \u00d7 d bandwidth matrix H. This generalizes the scalar bandwidth h > 0 i.e. H = h2I. Such a generalization is significant to multivariate statistics e.g. Silverman (1986); Simonoff (1996).\nOur work begins by using VC-based Bernstein-type uniform convergence bounds to attain finite-sample rates for a fixed unknown density f over Rd (Theorem 1). These bounds hold with high-probability under general assumptions on f and the kernel i.e. we only require f to be\n1Google.

Moreover, these bounds hold uniformly over Rd and bandwidth matrices H.\nWe then show the versatility of our results by applying it to the related areas of KDE rates under `\u221e, mode estimation, density level-set estimation, and class probability estimation. We then extend our analysis to the manifold setting. Finally, we provide uniform finite-sample results for local intrinsic dimension estimation. Each of these contributions are significant on their own."}, {"heading": "2. Contributions and Related Works", "text": "`\u221e bounds for KDE: It must first be noted that bounding |f\u0302h \u2212 f |\u221e where f\u0302h is the KDE of f for scalar h > 0 is a more difficult problem than for example bounding the mean-squared error Ef [(f\u0302h \u2212 f)2]. Gine & Guillon (2002) and Einmahl & Mason (2005) give asymptotic convergence results on KDE for |f\u0302h \u2212 Ef f\u0302h|\u221e. In their work about density clustering, Rinaldo & Wasserman (2010) extends the results of the former to obtain high-probability finitesample bounds. This is to our knowledge the strongest and most general uniform finite-sample result about KDE thus far. We show a general bound of form |f\u0302h(x) \u2212 f(x)| . x +\u221a log n/nhd where x is a function of the kernel and the smoothness of f at x which holds with probability 1\u2212 1/n uniformly over x \u2208 Rd and h (Theorem 1). An almost direct consequence is that if we take f to be \u03b1-Ho\u0308lder continuous then under the optimal choice for h \u2248 n\u22121/(2\u03b1+d), we have |f\u0302h\u2212f |\u221e . n\u2212\u03b1/(2\u03b1+d) with probability 1\u22121/n (Theorem 2). This matches the known lower bound (Tsybakov, 2008).\nWhen comparing our finite-sample results to that of Rinaldo & Wasserman (2010), there are a few notable differences. Our results hold uniformly across bandwidths and the probability that the bounds hold are independent of the bandwidth (in fact, holds with probability 1 \u2212 1/n). Our results also extends to general bandwidth matrix H.\nThis can be significant to analyze KDE-based procedures with adaptive bandwidths\u2013 i.e. when the bandwidths change depending on the region. Then the need for bounds which hold simultaneously over bandwidth choices be-\ncomes clear. Such an example includes adaptive or variable KDE (Terrell & Scott, 1992; Botev et al., 2010) which extends KDE to bandwidths that vary over the data space.\nThus our result for uniform finite-sample KDE bounds can be seen as a refinement to existing results.\nMode estimation Estimating the modes of a distribution has a long history e.g. Parzen (1962); Chernoff (1964); Eddy (1980); Silverman (1981); Cheng (1995); Abraham et al. (2004); Li et al. (2007); Dasgupta & Kpotufe (2014); Genovese et al. (2015); Jiang & Kpotufe (2017). The modes can be viewed as the central tendancies of a distribution and this line of work has played a significant role in areas such as clustering, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.\nMuch of the early work focused on the estimator argmaxx\u2208Rd f\u0302h(x). While many useful insights have come from studying this, it is difficult to algorithmically compute. Abraham et al. (2004) turned to the simple estimator argmaxx\u2208X f\u0302h(x) and showed that it behaves asymptotically as argmaxx\u2208Rd f\u0302h(x) where X is the data. In this paper, we show that this estimator is actually a rate-optimal estimator of the mode under finite samples with appropriate bandwidth choice. This would not have been possible without the appropriate bounds on KDE. This approach is similar to that of Dasgupta & Kpotufe (2014), who apply their k-NN density estimation bounds to show that the kNN analogue of the estimator is rate-optimal.\nAnother approach to mode estimation that must be noted is mean-shift (Fukunaga & Hostetler, 1975; Cheng, 1995; Comaniciu & Meer, 2002; Arias-Castro et al., 2016), which is a popular clustering algorithm amongst practitioners based on performing a gradient-ascent of the KDE. Its theoretical analysis however is still far from complete; the difficulty comes from analyzing KDE\u2019s ability to estimate gradients. Here we are focused on density estimation rather than density derivative estimation so our results do not appear immediately applicable to mean-shift.\nDensity level-set estimation The problem of density-level set estimation has been extensively studied e.g. Carmichael et al. (1968); Hartigan (1975); Cuevas & Fraiman (1997); Tsybakov (1997); Cadre (2006); Rigollet & Vert (2009); Singh et al. (2009); Rinaldo & Wasserman (2010); Steinwart (2011); Jiang (2017). It involves estimating {x : f(x) \u2265 \u03bb} for some \u03bb > 0 and density f based on samples drawn from f . This turns out to be one of the earliest and still currently most popular means of modeling clusters in the context of density-based clustering. The level-sets also influenced much of the work on hierarchical clustering (Chaudhuri & Dasgupta, 2010).\nNaturally, we must use some density estimator to get a handle on \u03bb. It turns out that in order to obtain the most gen-\neral uniform recovery bounds (e.g. finite-sample Hausdorff rates (Singh et al., 2009)), one also needs similar uniform density estimation bounds. The strongest known results thus far use density estimators that are often impractical (e.g. histogram density estimator) in order to obtain these theoretical rates over a practical one such as KDE. Much of the work, especially ones using more practical density estimators have focused on bounding metrics such as symmetric set difference, which are computed as an expectation over f . This is considerably weaker than the Hausdorff metric, which imposes a uniform guarantee over each estimated point and each point in the level-set.\nWe show that a simple KDE-based estimator is consistent under the Hausdorff metric; moreoever when the bandwidth is appropriately chosen, it attains the minimax optimal rate established by Tsybakov (1997).\nClass probability estimation Class probability estimation involves estimating the probability distribution over a set of classes for a given input. In other words, it is an approach to classification which involves first estimating the marginal density f(Y |X) (where X is the observation and Y is its category) and then choosing the category with highest probability. This density-based approach to classification has been studied in many places under nonparametric assumptions. e.g. Rigollet (2007); Chaudhuri et al. (2009). However, there are still aspects about its convergence properties that haven\u2019t been fully understood. In the current work, we give uniform rates on the approximation of f(Y |X). Much of the related work assume the binary classification case and derive a hard classifier based on the marginal density and compare the risk between that and the Bayes-optimal classifier. Our work differs in that we give uniform bounds on the recovery of the marginal density, which is a considerably stronger notion of consistency. This is important in situations where a worst-case bound on classifier performance is required.\nDensity Estimation on Manifolds Density estimation on manifolds has received much less attention than the fulldimensional counterpart. However, understanding density estimation in situations where the intrinsic dimension can be much lower than the ambient dimension is becoming ever more important: modern systems are able to capture data at an increasing resolution while the number of degrees of freedom stays relatively constant. One of the limiting aspects of density-based approaches is their performance in high dimensions. It takes an exponential in dimension number of samples to estimate the density \u2013 this is the so-called curse of dimensionality. Here we give results whose rates of convergence depend on the dimension of the manifold dM compared to a much higher ambient dimension d; thus the convergence properties become much more attractive under the manifold hypothesis.\nLocal Intrinsic Dimension Estimation Many learning algorithms require the intrinsic dimension as an input in order to take advantage of the lower dimensional structure that arises. There has been much work on estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data given finite samples e.g. (Ke\u0301gl, 2003). However, the more interesting problem of estimating the local intrinsic dimension has received much less attention. The bulk of the work in this area e.g. (Costa et al., 2005; Houle, 2013; Amsaleg et al., 2015) provide interesting estimators, but are unable to establish strong finitesample guarantees under nonparametric assumptions. In this paper, we consider a simple notion of local intrinsic dimension based on the doubling dimension and utilize a simple estimator. We then give a uniform finite-sample convergence result for the estimator under nonparametric assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is perhaps the strongest finite-sample result obtained this far for this problem."}, {"heading": "3. Background and Setup", "text": "Definition 1.

These conditions can be satisfied by taking h sufficiently small.\nRemark 6. The parameter allows us the amount of slack in the estimation errors. This is useful in a few aspects. Oftentimes, we don\u2019t require tight bounds, especially when reasoning about low density regions thus having a large allows us to satisfy the conditions more easily. In the case that we want tight bounds, the additive error controlled by the pointwise smoothness of the density can be encoded in , so to not require global smoothness assumptions.\nRemark 7. Besides the ||f ||\u221e factor, the value of C at the end of the theorem statement is a quantity which can be known without any a priori knowledge of f . We can bound ||f ||\u221e in terms of known quantities given smoothness assumptions near argmaxxf(x). This is used in later results where knowing a value of C is important.\nIn order to prove Theorem 1, we first define the following two functions which serve to approximateK as a step-wise linear combination of uniform kernels.

We (1) derive finite-sample high-probability density estimation bounds for multivariate KDE under mild density assumptions which hold uniformly in x \u2208 R and bandwidth matrices. We apply these results to (2) mode, (3) density level set, and (4) class probability estimation and attain optimal rates up to logarithmic factors. We then (5) provide an extension of our results under the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we (6) give uniform convergence results for local intrinsic dimension estimation.", "title": "Uniform Convergence Rates for Kernel Density Estimation"}
