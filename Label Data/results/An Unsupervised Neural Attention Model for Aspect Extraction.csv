Entering a new group is rarely easy.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Adjusting to unfamiliar behavioral norms and donning a new identity can be cognitively and emotionally taxing, and failure to do so can lead to exclusion.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"But successful enculturation to the group often yields significant rewards, especially in organizational contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Fitting in has been tied to positive career outcomes such as faster time-to-promotion, higher performance ratings, and reduced risk of being fired (O’Reilly et al., 1991; Goldberg et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A major challenge for enculturation research is distinguishing between internalization and self-
regulation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Internalization, a more inwardly focused process, involves identifying as a group member and accepting group norms, while selfregulation, a more outwardly oriented process, entails deciphering the group’s normative code and adjusting one’s behavior to comply with it.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing approaches, which generally rely on selfreports, are subject to various forms of reporting bias and typically yield only static snapshots of this process.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent computational approaches that use language as a behavioral signature of group integration uncover dynamic traces of enculturation but cannot distinguish between internalization and self-regulation.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To overcome these limitations, we introduce a dynamic measure of directed linguistic accommodation between a newcomer and existing group members.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Our approach differentiates between an individual’s (1) base rate of word use and (2) linguistic alignment to interlocutors.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The former corresponds to internalization of the group’s linguistic norms, whereas the latter reflects the capacity to regulate one’s language in response to peers’ language use.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We apply this language model to a corpus of internal email communications and personnel records, spanning a seven-year period, from a mid-sized technology firm.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that changes in base rates and alignment, especially with respect to pronoun use, are consistent with successful assimilation into a group and can predict eventual employment outcomes— continued employment, involuntary exit, or voluntary exit—at levels above chance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We use this predictive problem to investigate the nature of linguistic alignment.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our results suggest that the common formulation of alignment as a lexical-level phenomenon is incomplete.

Linguistic alignment Linguistic alignment is the tendency to use the same or similar words as one’s conversational partner.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Alignment is an instance of a widespread and socially important human behavior: communication accommodation, the tendency of two interacting people to nonconsciously adopt similar behaviors.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Evidence of accommodation appears in many behavioral dimensions, including gestures, postures, speech rate, self-disclosure, and language or dialect choice (see Giles et al. (1991) for a review).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"More accommodating people are rated by their interlocutors as more intelligible, attractive, and cooperative (Feldman, 1968; Ireland et al., 2011; Triandis, 1960).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"These perceptions have material consequences—for example, high accommodation requests are more likely to be fulfilled, and pairs who accommodate more in how they express uncertainty perform better in lab-based tasks (Buller and Aune, 1988; Fusaroli et al., 2012).
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Although accommodation is ubiquitous, individuals vary in their levels of accommodation in ways that are socially informative.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Notably, more powerful people are accommodated more strongly in many settings, including trials (Gnisci, 2005), online forums (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012), and Twitter (Doyle et al., 2016).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Most relevant for this work, speakers may increase their accommodation to signal camaraderie or decrease it to differentiate from the group.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For example, Bourhis and Giles (1977) found that Welsh English speakers increased their use of the Welsh accent and language in response to an English speaker who dismissed it.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
Person-group fit and linguistic alignment These findings suggest that linguistic alignment is a useful avenue for studying how people assimilate into a group.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Whereas traditional approaches to studying person-group fit rely on self-reports that are subject to various forms of reporting bias and cannot feasibly be collected with high granularity across many points in time, recent studies have proposed language-based measures as a means to tracing the dynamics of person-group fit without having to rely on self-reports.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Building on Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013)’s research into language use similarities as a proxy for social distance between individuals, Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) and Goldberg et al. (2016) devel-
oped a measure of cultural fit based on the similarity in linguistic style between individuals and their colleagues in an organization.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Their timevarying measure highlights linguistic compatibility as an important facet of cultural fit and reveals distinct trajectories of enculturation for employees with different career outcomes.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While this approach can help uncover the dynamics and consequences of an individual’s fit with her colleagues in an organization, it cannot disentangle the underlying reasons for this alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For two primary reasons, it cannot distinguish between fit that arises from internalization and fit produced by self-regulation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"First, Goldberg et al. (2016) and Srivastava et al. (forthcoming) define fit using a symmetric measure, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which does not take into account the direction of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
Yet the distinction between an individual adapting to peers versus peers adapting to the individual would appear to be consequential.,2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Second, this prior work considers fit across a wide range of linguistic categories but does not interrogate the role of particular categories, such as pronouns, that can be especially informative about enculturation.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"For example, a person’s base rate use of the first-person singular (I) or plural (we) might indicate the degree of group identity internalization, whereas adjustment to we usage in response to others’ use of the pronoun might reveal the degree of self-regulation to the group’s normative expectations.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Modeling fit with WHAM To address these limitations, we build upon and extend the WHAM alignment framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016) to analyze the dynamics of internalization and selfregulation using the complete corpus of email communications and personnel records from a mid-sized technology company over a seven-year period.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM uses a conditional measure of alignment, separating overall homophily (unconditional similarity in people’s language use, driven by internalized similarity) from in-the-moment adaptation (adjusting to another’s usage, corresponding to self-regulation).",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"WHAM also provides a directed measure of alignment, in that it estimates a replier’s adaptation to the other conversational participant separately from the participant’s adaptation to the replier.
Level(s) of alignment The convention within linguistic alignment research, dating back to early
work on Linguistic Style Matching (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002), is to look at lexical alignment: the repetition of the same or similar words across conversation participants.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"From a communication accommodation standpoint, this is justified by assuming that one’s choice of words represents a stylistic signal that is partially independent of the meaning one intends to express—similar to the accommodation on paralinguistic signals discussed above.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"The success of previous linguistic alignment research shows that this is valid.
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"However, words are difficult to divorce from their meanings, and sometimes repeating a word conflicts with repeating its referent.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"In particular, pronouns often refer to different people depending on who uses the pronoun.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"While there is evidence that one person using a first-person singular pronoun increases the likelihood that her conversation partner will as well (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007), we may also expect that one person using first-person singular pronouns may cause the other to use more second-person pronouns, so that both people are referring to the same person.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"This is especially important under the Interactive Alignment Model view (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), where conversants align their entire mental representations, which predicts both lexical and referential alignment behaviors will be observed.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Discourse-strategic explanations for alignment also predict alignment at multiple levels (Doyle and Frank, 2016).
",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"Since we have access to a high-quality corpus with meaningful outcome measures, we can investigate the relative importance of these two types of alignment.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We will show that referential alignment is more predictive of employment outcomes than is lexical alignment, suggesting a need for alignment research to consider both levels rather than just the latter.",2 Linguistic Alignment and Group Fit,[0],[0]
"We use the complete corpus of internal emails exchanged among full-time employees at a midsized US-based technology company between 2009 to 2014 (Srivastava et al., forthcoming).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
Each email was summarized as a count of word categories in its text.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"These categories are a subset of the Linguistic Information and Word Count system (Pennebaker et al., 2007).",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"The categories were chosen because they are likely to be indica-
tive of one’s standing/role within a group.1
We divided email chains into message-reply pairs to investigate conditional alignment between a message and its reply.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To limit these pairs to cases where the reply was likely related to the preceding message, we removed all emails with more than one sender or recipient (including CC/BCC), identical sender and recipient, or where the sender or recipient was an automatic notification system or any other mailbox that was not specific to a single employee.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"We also excluded emails with no body text or more than 500 words in the body text, and pairs with more than a week’s latency between message and reply.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Finally, because our analyses involve enculturation dynamics over the first six months of employment, we excluded replies sent by an employee whose overall tenure was less than six months.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"This resulted in a collection of 407,779 messagereply pairs, with 485 distinct replying employees.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
We combined this with monthly updates of employees joining and leaving the company and whether they left voluntarily or involuntarily.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Of the 485, 66 left voluntarily, 90 left involuntarily, and 329 remained employed at the end of the observation period.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
Privacy protections and ethical considerations Research based on employees’ archived electronic communications in organizational settings poses potential threats to employee privacy and company confidentiality.,3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To address these concerns, and following established ethical guidelines for the conduct of such research (Borgatti and Molina, 2003), we implemented the following procedures: (a) raw data were stored on secure research servers behind the company’s firewall; (b) messages exchanged with individuals outside the firm were eliminated; (c) all identifying information such as email addresses was transformed into hashed identifiers, with the company retaining access to the key code linking identifying information to hashed identifiers; and (d) raw message content was transformed into linguistic categories so that identities could not be inferred from message content.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"Per terms of the non-disclosure agreement we signed with the firm, we are not able to share the data underlying the analyses reported below.
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"1Six pronoun categories (first singular (I), first plural (we), second (you), third singular personal (he, she), third singular impersonal (it, this), and third plural (they)) and five time/certainty categories (past tense, present tense, future tense, certainty, and tentativity).
",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"We can, however, share the code and dummy test data, both of which can be accessed at http: //github.com/gabedoyle/acl2017.",3 Data: Corporate Email Corpus,[0],[0]
"To assess alignment, we use the Word-Based Hierarchical Alignment Model (WHAM) framework (Doyle and Frank, 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The core principle of WHAM is that alignment is a change, usually an increase, in the frequency of using a word category in a reply when the word category was used in the preceding message.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For instance, a reply to the message What will we discuss at the meeting?, is likely to have more instances of future tense than a reply to the message What did we discuss at the meeting?",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Under this definition, alignment is the log-odds shift from the baseline reply frequency, the frequency of the word in a reply when the preceding message did not contain the word.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"WHAM is a hierarchical generative modeling framework, so it uses information from related observations (e.g., multiple repliers with similar demographics) to improve its robustness on sparse data (Doyle et al., 2016).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"There are two key parameters, shown in Figure 2: ηbase, the log-odds of a given word category c when the preceding message did not contain c, and ηalign, the increase in the log-odds of c when the preceding message did contain c.
A dynamic extension To understand enculturation, we need to track changes in both the alignment and baseline over time.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"We add a month-bymonth change term to WHAM, yielding a piecewise linear model of these factors over the course of an employee’s tenure.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Each employee’s tenure is broken into two or three segments: their first six months after being hired, their last six months before leaving (if they leave), and the rest of their tenure.2 The linear segments for their alignment are fit as an intercept term ηalign, based at their first month (for the initial period) or their last month (for the final period), and per-month slopes α.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Baseline segments are fit similarly, with parameters ηbase and β.3",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To visualize the align-
2Within each segment, the employee’s alignment model is similar to that of Yurovsky et al. (2016), who introduced a constant by-month slope parameter to model changes in parent-child alignment during early linguistic development.
3The six month timeframe was chosen as previous research has found it to be a critical period for early enculturation (Bauer et al., 1998).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Pilot investigations into the change
ment behaviors and the parameter values, we create “sawhorse” plots, with an example in Figure 1.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In our present work, we are focused on changes in cultural fit during the transitions into or out of the group, so we collapse observations outside the first/last six months into a stable point estimate, constraining their slopes to be zero.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This simplification also circumvents the issue of different employees having different middle-period lengths.4
Model structure The graphical model for our instantiation of WHAM is shown in Figure 2.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For each word category c, WHAM’s generative model represents each reply as a series of tokenby-token independent draws from a binomial distribution.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The binomial probability µ is dependent on whether the preceding message did (µalign) or did not (µbase) contain a word from category c, and the inferred alignment value is the difference between these probabilities in log-odds space (ηalign).
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The specific values of these variables depend on three hierarchical features: the word category c, the group g that a given employee falls into, and the time period t (a piece of the piece-wise
in baseline usage over time showed roughly linear changes over the first/last six months, but our linearity assumption may mask interesting variation in the enculturation trajectories.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"4As shown in Figure 1, the pieces do not need to define a continuous function.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Alignment behaviors continue to change in the middle of an employee’s tenure (Srivastava et al., forthcoming), so alignment six months in to the job is unlikely to be equal to alignment six months from leaving, or the average alignment over the middle tenure.
linear function: beginning, middle, or end).",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Note that the hierarchical ordering is different for the η chains and the α/β chains; c is above g and t for the η chains, but below them for the α/β chains.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This is because we expect the static (η) values for a given word category to be relatively consistent across different groups and at different times, but we expect the values to be independent across the different word categories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Conversely, we expect that the enculturation trajectories across word categories (α/β) will be similar, while the trajectories may vary substantially across different groups and different times.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Lastly, the month m in which a reply is written (measured from the start of the time period t) has a linear effect on the η value, as described below.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"To estimate alignment, we first divide the replies up by group, time period, and calendar month.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We separate the replies into two sets based on whether the preceding message contained the category c (the “alignment” set) or not (the “baseline” set).,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All replies within a set are then aggregated in a single bag-of-words representation, with category token counts Calignc,g,t,m and C base c,g,t,m, and total token counts N basec,g,t,m and N base c,g,t,m comprising the observed variables on the far right of the model.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"Moving from right to left, these counts are assumed to come from binomial draws with prob-
ability µalignc,g,t,m or µ base c,g,t,m. The µ values are then in turn generated from η values in log-odds space by an inverse-logit transform, similar to linear predictors in logistic regression.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The ηbase variables are representations of the baseline frequency of a marker in log-odds space, and µbase is simply a conversion of ηbase to probability space, the equivalent of an intercept term in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"ηalign is an additive value, with µalign = logit−1(ηbase + ηalign), the equivalent of a binary feature coefficient in a logistic regression.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The specific month’s η variables are calculated as a linear function: ηalignc,g,t,m = η align c,g,t +",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"mαc,g,t, and similarly with β for the baseline.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The remainder of the model is a hierarchy of normal distributions that integrate social structure into the analysis.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In the present work, we have three levels in the hierarchy: category, group, and time period.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"In Analysis 1, employees are grouped by their employment outcome (stay, leave voluntarily, leave involuntarily); in Analyses 2 & 3, where we predict the employment outcomes, each group is a single employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
The normal distributions that connect these levels have identical standard deviations σ2 = .25.5,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The hierarchies
5The deviation is not a theoretically motivated choice, and was chosen as a good empirical balance between reasonable parameter convergence (improved by smaller σ2) and good model log-probability (improved by larger σ2).
are headed by a normal distribution centered at 0, except for the ηbase hierarchy, which has a Cauchy(0, 2.5) distribution.6
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
Message and reply length can affect alignment estimates; the WHAM model was developed in part to reduce this effect.,4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"As different employees had different email length distributions, we further accounted for length by dividing all replies into five quintile length bins, and treated each bin as separate observations for each employee.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"This design choice adds an additional control factor, but results were qualitatively similar without it.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"All of our analyses are based on parameter estimates from RStan fits of WHAM with 500 iterations over four chains.
",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"While previous research on cultural fit has emphasized either its internalization (O’Reilly et al., 1991) or self-regulation (Goldberg et al., 2016) components, our extension to the WHAM framework helps disentangle them by estimating them as separate baseline and alignment trajectories.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"For example, we can distinguish between an archetypal individual who initially aligns to her colleagues and then internalizes this style of communication such that her baseline use also shifts and another archetypal person who aligns to her colleagues but does not change her baseline usage.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
"The former exhibits high correspondence between internalization and self-regulation, whereas the latter demonstrates an ability to decouple them.",4 Model: An Extended WHAM Framework,[0],[0]
We perform three analyses on this data.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"First, we examine the qualitative behaviors of pronoun alignment and how they map onto employee outcomes in the data.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Second, we show that these qualitative differences in early enculturation are meaningful, with alignment behaviors predicting employment outcome above chance.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we consider lexical versus referential levels of alignment and show that predictions are improved under the referential formulation, suggesting that alignment is not limited to low-level wordrepetition effects.
",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"6As ηbase is the log-odds of each word in a reply being a part of the category c, it is expected to be substantially negative.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"For example, second person pronouns (you), are around 2% of the words in replies, approximately −4 in log-odds space.",5 Analyses,[0],[0]
We follow Gelman et al. (2008)’s recommendation of the Cauchy prior as appropriate for parameter estimation in logistic regression.,5 Analyses,[0],[0]
"We begin with descriptive analyses of the behavior of pronouns, which are likely to reflect incorporation into the company.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"In particular, we look at first-person singular (I), first-person plural (we), and second-person pronouns (you).",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"We expect that increases in we usage will occur as the employee is integrated into the group, while I and you usage will decrease, and want to understand whether these changes manifest on baseline usage (i.e., internalization), alignment (i.e., self-regulation), or both.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Design We divided each employee’s emails by calendar month, and separated them into the employee’s first six months, their last six months (if an employee left the company within the observation period), and the middle of their tenure.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees with fewer than twelve months at the company were excluded from this analysis, so that their first and last months did not overlap.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
We fit two WHAM models in this analysis.,5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The first aggregated all employees, regardless of employment outcome, to minimize noise; the second separated them by outcome to analyze cultural fit differences.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Outcome-aggregated model We start with the aggregated behavior of all employees, shown in Figure 3.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"For baselines, we see decreased use of I
and you over the first six months, with we usage increasing over the same period, confirming the expected result that incorporating into the group is accompanied by more inclusive pronoun usage.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Despite the baseline changes, alignment is fairly stable through the first six months.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Alignment on first-person singular and second-person pronouns is lower than first-person plural pronouns, likely due to the fact that I or you have different referents when used by the two conversants, while both conversants could use we to refer to the same group.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
We will consider this referential alignment in more detail in Analysis 3.,5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Since employees with different outcomes have much different experiences over their last six months, we will not discuss them in aggregate, aside from noting the sharp decline in we alignment near the end of the employees’ tenures.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Outcome-separated model Figure 4 shows outcome-specific trajectories, with green lines showing involuntary leavers (i.e., those who are fired or downsized), blue showing voluntary leavers, and orange showing employees who remained at the company through the final month of the data.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The use of I and you is similar to the aggregates in Figure 3, regardless of group.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The last six months of I usage show an interesting difference, where involuntary leavers align more on I but retain a stable baseline while voluntary leavers retain a stable alignment but increase I overall, which is consistent with group separation.
",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"The most compelling result we see here, though, is the changes in we usage by different groups of employees.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees who eventually leave the
company involuntarily show signs of more selfregulation than internalization over the first six months, increasing their alignment while decreasing their baseline use (though they return to more similar levels as other employees later in their tenure).",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"Employees who stay at the company, as well as those who later leave voluntarily, show signs of internalization, increasing their baseline usage to the company average, as well as adapting their alignment levels to the mean.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"This finding suggests that how quickly the employees internalize culturally-standard language use predicts their eventual employment outcome, even if they eventually end up near the average.",5.1 Analysis 1: Dynamic Qualitative Changes,[0],[0]
"This analysis tests the hypothesis that there are meaningful differences in employees’ initial enculturation, captured by alignment behaviors.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
We examine the first six months of communications and attempt to predict whether the employee will leave the company.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We find that, even with a simple classifier, alignment behaviors are predictive of employment outcome.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
Design We fit the WHAM model to only the first six months of email correspondence for all employees who had at least six months of email.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"The model estimated the initial level of baseline use (ηbase) and alignment (ηalign) for each employee, as well as the slope (α, β) for baseline and alignment over those first six months, over all 11 word categories mentioned in Section 3.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We then created logistic regression classifiers, using the parameter estimates to predict whether an employee would leave the company.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
We fit separate classifiers for leaving voluntarily or involuntarily.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our results show that early alignment behaviors are better at identifying employees who will leave involuntarily than voluntarily, consistent with Srivastava et al.’s (forthcoming) findings that voluntary leavers are similar to stayers until late in their tenure.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We fit separate classifiers using the alignment parameters and the baseline parameters to investigate their relative informativity.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"For each model, we report the area under the curve (AUC).",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This value is estimated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate over different classification thresholds.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
An AUC of 0.5 represents chance performance.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We use balanced, stratified cross-
validation to reduce AUC misestimation due to unbalanced outcome frequencies and high noise (Parker et al., 2007).
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Results The left column of Figure 5 shows the results over 10 runs of 10-fold balanced logistic classifiers with stratified cross-validation in R. The alignment-based classifiers are both above chance at predicting that an employee will leave the company, whether involuntarily or voluntarily.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"The baseline-based classifiers perform worse, especially on voluntary leavers.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This finding is consistent with the idea that voluntary leavers resemble stayers (who form the bulk of the employees) until late in their tenure when their cultural fit declines.
",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"We fit a model using both alignment and baseline parameters, but this model yielded an AUC value below the alignment-only classifier.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"This suggests that where alignment and baseline behaviors are both predictive, they do not provide substantially different predictive power and lead to overfitting.",5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
A more sophisticated classifier may overcome these challenges; our goal here was not to achieve maximal classification performance but to test whether alignment provided any useful information about employment outcomes.,5.2 Analysis 2: Predicting Outcomes,[0],[0]
"Our final analysis investigates the nature of linguistic alignment: specifically, whether there is an effect of referential alignment beyond that of the more commonly used lexical alignment.
",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
Testing this hypothesis requires a small change to the alignment calculations.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"Lexical alignment is based on the conditional probability of the replier using a word category c given that the preceding message used that same category c. For referential alignment, we examine the conditional probability of the replier using a word category cj given that the preceding message used the category ci, where ci and cj are likely to be referentially linked.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"We also consider cases where ci is likely to transition to cj throughout the course of the conversation, such as present tense verbs turning into past tense as the event being described recedes into the past.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"The pairs of categories that are likely to be referentially or transitionally linked are: (you, I); (we, I); (you, we); (past, present); (present, future); and (certainty, tentativity).",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"We include both directions of these pairs, so this provides approximately the same number of predictor variables for both situa-
tions to maximize comparability (12 for the referential alignments, 11 for the lexical).",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"This modification does not change the structure of the WHAM model, but rather changes its C and N counts by reclassifying replies between the baseline or alignment pathways.
",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
Results Figure 5 plots the differences in predictive model performance using lexical versus referential alignment parameters.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
We find that the semantic parameters provide more accurate classification than the lexical both for voluntarily and involuntarily-leaving employees.,5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"This suggests that while previous work looking at lexical alignment successfully captures social structure, referential alignment may reflect a deeper and more accurate representation of the social structure.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"It is unclear if this behavior holds in less formal situations or with weaker organizational structure and shared goals, but these results suggest that the traditional alignment approach of only measuring lexical alignment should be augmented with referential alignment measures for a more complete analysis.",5.3 Analysis 3: Types of Alignment,[0],[0]
"A key finding from this work is that pronoun usage behaviors in employees’ email communication are consistent with social integration into the group; employees use “I” pronouns less and
“we” pronouns more as they integrate.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, we see the importance of using an alignment measure such as WHAM for distinguishing the base rate and alignment usage of words.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Employees who leave the company involuntarily show increased “we” usage through greater alignment, using “we” more when prompted by a colleague, but introducing it less of their own accord.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This suggests that these employees do not feel fully integrated into the group, although they are willing to identify as a part of it when a more fully-integrated group member includes them, corresponding to self-regularization over internalization.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The fact that these alignment measures alone, without any job productivity or performance metrics, have some predictive capability for employees’ leaving the company suggests the potential for support or intervention programs to help highperforming but poorly-integrated employees integrate into the company better.
",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"More generally, the prominence of pronominally-driven communication changes suggest that alignment analyses can provide insight into a range of social integration settings.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This may be especially helpful in cases where there is great pressure to integrate smoothly, and people would be likely to adopt a self-regulating approach even if they do not internalize their group membership.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Such settings not only include the high-stakes situation of keeping one’s job, but of transitioning from high school to college or moving to a new country or region.",6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Maximizing the chances for new members to become comfortable within a group is critical both for spreading useful aspects of the group’s existing culture to new members and for integrating new ideas from the new members’ knowledge and practices.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
Alignment-based approaches can be a useful tool in separating effective interventions that cause internalization of the group dynamics from those that lead to more superficial self-regularization changes.,6 Discussion,[0],[0]
This paper described an effort to use directed linguistic alignment as a measure of cultural fit within an organization.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"We adapted a hierarchical alignment model from previous work to estimate fit within corporate email communications, focusing on changes in language during employees’ entry to and exit from the company.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Our results
showed substantial changes in the use of pronouns, with pronoun patterns varying by employees’ outcomes within the company.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
The use of the firstperson plural “we” during an employee’s first six months is particularly instructive.,7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Whereas stayers exhibited increased baseline use, indicating internalization, those eventually departing involuntarily were on the one hand decreasingly likely to introduce “we” into conversation, but increasingly responsive to interlocutors’ use of the pronoun.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"While not internalizing a shared identity with their peers, involuntarily departed employees were overly self-regulating in response to its invocation by others.
",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Quantitatively, rates of usage and alignment in the first six months of employment carried information about whether employees left involuntarily, pointing towards fit within the company culture early on as an indicator of eventual employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Finally, we saw ways in which the application of alignment to cultural fit might help to refine ideas about alignment itself: preliminary analysis suggested that referential, rather than lexical, alignment was more predictive of employment outcomes.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"More broadly, these results suggest ways that quantitative methods can be used to make precise application of concepts like “cultural fit” at scale.",7 Conclusions,[0],[0]

Cultural fit is widely believed to affect the success of individuals and the groups to which they belong.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"Yet it remains an elusive, poorly measured construct.",abstractText,[0],[0]
Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"By contrast, we develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic alignment, which estimates the influence of one person’s word use on another’s and distinguishes between two enculturation mechanisms: internalization and selfregulation.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"We use this measure to trace employees’ enculturation trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of individuals downstream outcomes, especially involuntary exit.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"In instruction-following tasks, an agent executes a sequence of actions in a real or simulated environment, in response to a sequence of natural language commands.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Examples include giving navigational directions to robots and providing hints to automated game-playing agents.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Plans specified with natural language exhibit compositionality both at the level of individual actions and at the overall sequence level.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper describes a framework for learning to follow instructions by leveraging structure at both levels.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our primary contribution is a new, alignmentbased approach to grounded compositional semantics.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Building on related logical approaches (Reddy et al., 2014; Pourdamghani et al., 2014), we recast instruction following as a pair of nested, structured alignment problems.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Given instructions and a candidate plan, the model infers a sequenceto-sequence alignment between sentences and
atomic actions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Within each sentence–action pair, the model infers a structure-to-structure alignment between the syntax of the sentence and a graphbased representation of the action.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"At a high level, our agent is a block-structured, graph-valued conditional random field, with alignment potentials to relate instructions to actions and transition potentials to encode the environment model (Figure 3).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Explicitly modeling sequenceto-sequence alignments between text and actions allows flexible reasoning about action sequences, enabling the agent to determine which actions are specified (perhaps redundantly) by text, and which actions must be performed automatically (in order to satisfy pragmatic constraints on interpretation).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Treating instruction following as a sequence prediction problem, rather than a series of independent decisions (Branavan et al., 2009; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013), makes it possible to use general-purpose planning machinery, greatly increasing inferential power.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The fragment of semantics necessary to complete most instruction-following tasks is essentially predicate–argument structure, with limited influence from quantification and scoping.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Thus the problem of sentence interpretation can reasonably be modeled as one of finding an alignment between language and the environment it describes.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We allow this structure-to-structure alignment— an “overlay” of language onto the world—to be mediated by linguistic structure (in the form of dependency parses) and structured perception (in what we term grounding graphs).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our model thereby reasons directly about the relationship between language and observations of the environment, without the need for an intermediate logical representation of sentence meaning.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This, in turn, makes it possible to incorporate flexible feature representations that have been difficult to integrate with previous work in semantic parsing.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We apply our approach to three established

2 1 3
instruction-following benchmarks: the map reading task of Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), the maze navigation task of MacMahon et al. (2006), and the puzzle solving task of Branavan et al. (2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
An example from each is shown in Figure 1.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These benchmarks exhibit a range of qualitative properties—both in the length and complexity of their plans, and in the quantity and quality of accompanying language.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each task has been studied in isolation, but we are unaware of any published approaches capable of robustly handling all three.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our general model outperforms strong, task-specific baselines in each case, achieving relative error reductions of 15–20% over several state-of-the-art results.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Experiments demonstrate the importance of our contributions in both compositional semantics and search over plans.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We have released all code for this project at github.com/jacobandreas/instructions.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Existing work on instruction following can be roughly divided into two families: semantic parsers and linear policy estimators.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Semantic parsers Parser-based approaches (Chen and Mooney, 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013; Kim and Mooney, 2013) map from text into a formal language representing commands.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"These take familiar structured prediction models for semantic parsing (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006), and train them with task-provided supervision.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Instead of attempting to match the structure of a manually-annotated semantic parse, semantic parsers for instruction following are trained to maximize a reward signal
provided by black-box execution of the predicted command in the environment.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"(It is possible to think of response-based learning for question answering (Liang et al., 2013) as a special case.)
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"This approach uses a well-studied mechanism for compositional interpretation of language, but is subject to certain limitations.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Because the environment is manipulated only through black-box execution of the completed semantic parse, there is no way to incorporate current or future environment state into the scoring function.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
It is also in general necessary to hand-engineer a task-specific formal language for describing agent behavior.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Thus it is extremely difficult to work with environments that cannot be modeled with a fixed inventory of predicates (e.g. those involving novel strings or arbitrary real quantities).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Much of contemporary work in this family is evaluated on the maze navigation task introduced by MacMahon et al. (2006).,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Dukes (2013) also introduced a “blocks world” task for situated parsing of spatial robot commands.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Linear policy estimators An alternative family of approaches is based on learning a policy over primitive actions directly (Branavan et al., 2009; Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010).1 Policybased approaches instantiate a Markov decision process representing the action domain, and apply standard supervised or reinforcement-learning approaches to learn a function for greedily selecting among actions.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In linear policy approximators, natural language instructions are incorporated directly into state observations, and reading order
1This is distinct from semantic parsers in which greedy inference happens to have an interpretation as a policy (Vlachos and Clark, 2014).
becomes part of the action selection process.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Almost all existing policy-learning approaches make use of an unstructured parameterization, with a single (flat) feature vector representing all text and observations.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
Such approaches are thus restricted to problems that are simple enough (and have small enough action spaces) to be effectively characterized in this fashion.,2 Related work,[0],[0]
"While there is a great deal of flexibility in the choice of feature function (which is free to inspect the current and future state of the environment, the whole instruction sequence, etc.), standard linear policy estimators have no way to model compositionality in language or actions.
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Agents in this family have been evaluated on a variety of tasks, including map reading (Anderson et al., 1991) and gameplay (Branavan et al., 2009).
",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Though both families address the same class of instruction-following problems, they have been applied to a totally disjoint set of tasks.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"It should be emphasized that there is nothing inherent to policy learning that prevents the use of compositional structure, and nothing inherent to general compositional models that prevents more complicated dependence on environment state.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"Indeed, previous work (Branavan et al., 2011; Narasimhan et al., 2015) uses aspects of both to solve a different class of gameplay problems.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"In some sense, our goal in this paper is simply to combine the strengths of semantic parsers and linear policy estimators for fully general instruction following.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
"As we shall see, however, this requires changes to many aspects of representation, learning and inference.",2 Related work,[0],[0]
We wish to train a model capable of following commands in a simulated environment.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"We do so by presenting the model with a sequence of training pairs (x,y), where each x is a sequence of natural language instructions (x1, x2, . . .",3 Representations,[0],[0]
", xm), e.g.:
(Go down the yellow hall., Turn left., . . . )
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"and each y is a demonstrated action sequence (y1, y2, . . .",3 Representations,[0],[0]
", yn), e.g.:
(rotate(90), move(2), . . . )
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Given a start state, y can equivalently be characterized by a sequence of (state, action, state)
triples resulting from execution of the environment model.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
An example instruction is shown in Figure 2a.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example action, situated in the environment where it occurs, is shown in Figure 2e.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
Our model performs compositional interpretation of instructions by leveraging existing structure inherent in both text and actions.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Thus we interpret xi and yj not as raw strings and primitive actions, but rather as structured objects.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Linguistic structure We assume access to a pretrained parser, and in particular that each of the instructions xi is represented by a tree-structured dependency parse.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example is shown in Figure 2b.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Action structure By analogy to the representation of instructions as parse trees, we assume that each (state, action, state) triple (provided by the environment model) can be characterized by a grounding graph.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
The structure and content of this representation is task-specific.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"An example grounding graph for the maze navigation task is
shown in Figure 2d.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"The example contains a node corresponding to the primitive action move(2) (in the upper left), and several nodes corresponding to locations in the environment that are visible after the action is performed.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Each node in the graph (and, though not depicted, each edge) is decorated with a list of features.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"These features might be simple indicators (e.g. whether the primitive action performed was move or rotate), real values (the distance traveled) or even string-valued (English-language names of visible landmarks, if available in the environment description).",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Formally, a grounding graph consists of a tuple (V,E,L, fV , fE), with
– V a set of vertices
– E ∈ V × V a set of (directed) edges – L a space of labels (numbers, strings, etc.) – fV : V → 2L a vertex feature function – fE : E → 2L an edge feature function In this paper we have tried to remain agnostic to details of graph construction.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
Our goal with the grounding graph framework is simply to accommodate a wider range of modeling decisions than allowed by existing formalisms.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Graphs might be constructed directly, given access to a structured virtual environment (as in all experiments in this paper), or alternatively from outputs of a perceptual system.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"For our experiments, we have remained as close as possible to task representations described in the existing literature.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Details for each task can be found in the accompanying software package.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Graph-based representations are extremely common in formal semantics (Jones et al., 2012; Reddy et al., 2014), and the version presented here corresponds to a simple generalization of familiar formal methods.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Indeed, if L is the set of all atomic entities and relations, fV returns a unique label for every v ∈ V , and fE always returns a vector with one active feature, we recover the existentially-quantified portion of first order logic exactly, and in this form can implement large parts of classical neo-Davidsonian semantics (Parsons, 1990) using grounding graphs.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Crucially, with an appropriate choice of L this formalism also makes it possible to go beyond settheoretic relations, and incorporate string-valued features (like names of entities and landmarks) and real-valued features (like colors and positions) as well.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
Lexical semantics We must eventually combine features provided by parse trees with features provided by the environment.,3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Examples here might include simple conjunctions (word=yellow ∧ rgb=(0.5, 0.5, 0.0)) or more complicated computations like edit distance between landmark names and lexical items.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Features of the latter kind make it possible to behave correctly in environments containing novel strings or other features unseen during training.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"This aspect of the syntax–semantics interface has been troublesome for some logic-based approaches: while past work has used related machinery for selecting lexicon entries (Berant and Liang, 2014) or for rewriting logical forms (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), the relationship between text and the environment has ultimately been mediated by a discrete (and indeed finite) inventory of predicates.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Several recent papers have investigated simple grounded models with realvalued output spaces (Andreas and Klein, 2014; McMahan and Stone, 2015), but we are unaware of any fully compositional system in recent literature that can incorporate observations of these kinds.
",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"Formally, we assume access to a joining feature function φ : (2L × 2L)→ Rd.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"As with grounding graphs, our goal is to make the general framework as flexible as possible, and for individual experiments have chosen φ to emulate modeling decisions from previous work.",3 Representations,[0],[0]
"As noted in the introduction, we approach instruction following as a sequence prediction problem.",4 Model,[0],[0]
Thus we must place a distribution over sequences of actions conditioned on instructions.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"We decompose the problem into two components, describing interlocking models of “path structure” and “action structure”.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Path structure captures how sequences of instructions give rise to sequences of actions, while action structure captures the compositional relationship between individual utterances and the actions they specify.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Path structure: aligning utterances to actions
The high-level path structure in the model is depicted in Figure 3.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Our goal here is to permit both under- and over-specification of plans, and to expose a planning framework which allows plans to be computed with lookahead (i.e. non-greedily).
",4 Model,[0],[0]
These goals are achieved by introducing a sequence of latent alignments between instructions and actions.,4 Model,[0],[0]
Consider the multi-step example in Figure 1b.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"If the first instruction go down the yellow hall were interpreted immediately, we would have a presupposition failure—the agent is facing a wall, and cannot move forward at all.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Thus an implicit rotate action, unspecified by text, must be performed before any explicit instructions can be followed.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"To model this, we take the probability of a (text, plan, alignment) triple to be log-proportional to the sum of two quantities:
1.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"a path-only score ψ(n; θ) + ∑
j ψ(yj ; θ)
2.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"a path-and-text score, itself the sum of all pair scores ψ(xi, yj ; θ) licensed by the alignment
(1) captures our desire for pragmatic constraints on interpretation, and provides a means of encoding the inherent plausibility of paths.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"We take ψ(n; θ) and ψ(y; θ) to be linear functions of θ. (2) provides context-dependent interpretation of text by means of the structured scoring function ψ(x, y; θ), described in the next section.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Formally, we associate with each instruction xi a sequence-to-sequence alignment variable ai ∈ 1 . . .",4 Model,[0],[0]
n,4 Model,[0],[0]
"(recalling that n is the number of actions).
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Then we have2 p(y,a|x; θ) ∝ exp { ψ(n) + n∑ j=1 ψ(yj)
+",4 Model,[0],[0]
"m∑ i=1 n∑ j=1 1[aj = i] ψ(xi, yj) } (1)
We additionally place a monotonicity constraint on the alignment variables.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"This model is globally normalized, and for a fixed alignment is equivalent to a linear-chain CRF.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"In this sense it is analogous to IBM Model I (Brown et al., 1993), with the structured potentials ψ(xi, yj) taking the place of lexical translation probabilities.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"While alignment models from machine translation have previously been used to align words to fragments of semantic parses (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Pourdamghani et al., 2014), we are unaware of such models being used to align entire instruction sequences to demonstrations.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Action structure: aligning words to percepts Intuitively, this scoring function ψ(x, y) should capture how well a given utterance describes an action.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"If neither the utterances nor the actions had structure (i.e. both could be represented with simple bags of features), we would recover something analogous to the conventional policy-learning approach.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"As structure is essential for some of our tasks, ψ(x, y) must instead fill the role of a semantic parser in a conventional compositional model.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Our choice of ψ(x, y) is driven by the following fundamental assumptions: Syntactic relations approximately represent semantic relations.",4 Model,[0],[0]
Syntactic proximity implies relational proximity.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"In this view, there is an additional hidden structure-tostructure alignment between the grounding graph and the parsed text describing it.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"3 Words line up with nodes, and dependencies line up with relations.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Visualizations are shown in Figure 2c and the zoomed-in portion of Figure 3.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"As with the top-level alignment variables, this approach can viewed as a simple relaxation of a familiar model.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"CCG-based parsers assume that syntactic type strictly determines semantic type,
2Here and the remainder of this paper, we suppress the dependence of the various potentials on θ in the interest of readability.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
3It is formally possible to regard the sequence-tosequence and structure-to-structure alignments as a single (structured) random variable.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"However, the two kinds of alignments are treated differently for purposes of inference, so it is useful to maintain a notational distinction.
and that each lexical item is associated with a small set of functional forms.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Here we simply allow all words to license all predicates, multiple words to specify the same predicate, and some edges to be skipped.",4 Model,[0],[0]
We instead rely on a scoring function to impose soft versions of the hard constraints typically provided by a grammar.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"Related models have previously been used for question answering (Reddy et al., 2014; Pasupat and Liang, 2015).
",4 Model,[0],[0]
For the moment let us introduce variables b to denote these structure-to-structure alignments.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"(As will be seen in the following section, it is straightforward to marginalize over all choices of b.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Thus the structure-to-structure alignments are never explicitly instantiated during inference, and do not appear in the final form of ψ(x, y).)",4 Model,[0],[0]
"For a fixed alignment, we define ψ(x, y, b) according to a recurrence relation.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Let xi be the ith word of the sentence, and let yj be the jth node in the action graph (under some topological ordering).",4 Model,[0],[0]
Let c(i) and c(j) give the indices of the dependents of xi and children of yj respectively.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"Finally, let xik and yjl denote the associated dependency type or relation.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Define a “descendant” function:
d(i, j) = { (k, l) : k ∈ c(i), l ∈ c(j), (k, l) ∈ b}
Then, ψ(xi, yj , b) = exp { θ>φ(xi, yj)
+ ∑
(k,l)∈d(x,y)

"[ θ>φ ( xik, yjl ) · ψ(xk, yl, b)]}
This is just an unnormalized synchronous derivation between x and y—at any aligned (node, word) pair, the score for the entire derivation is the score produced by combining that word and node, times the scores at all the aligned descendants.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Observe that as long as there are no cycles in the dependency parse, it is perfectly acceptable for the relation graph to contain cycles and even self-loops— the recurrence still bottoms out appropriately.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Given a sequence of training pairs (x,y), we wish to find a parameter setting that maximizes p(y|x; θ).",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"If there were no latent alignments a or b, this would simply involve minimization of a convex objective.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
The presence of latent variables complicates things.,5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"Ideally, we would like

"Instead we make a series of variational approximations: first we replace the sum with a maximization, then perform iterated conditional modes, alternating between maximization of the conditional probability of a and θ.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"We begin by initializing θ randomly.
",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"As noted in the preceding section, the variable b does not appear in these equations.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"Conditioned on a, the sum over structure-to-structure ψ(x, y) = ∑ b ψ(x, y, b) can be performed exactly using a simple dynamic program which runs in time O(|x||y|)",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]

"This is Algorithm 1.
",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, θ is optimized using LBFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989).",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"Calculation of the gradient with respect to θ requires computation of a normalizing constant involving the sum over p(x,y′,a) for all y′.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"While in principle the normalizing constant can be computed using the forward algorithm, in practice the state spaces under consideration are so large that even this is intractable.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]

"Meanwhile, maximization of a can be performed exactly using the Viterbi algorithm, without computation of normalizers.
",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
Inference at test time involves a slightly different pair of optimization problems.,5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"We again perform iterated conditional modes, here on the alignments a and the unknown output path y. Maximization of a is accomplished with the Viterbi algorithm, exactly as before; maximization of y also uses the Viterbi algorithm, or a beam search when this is computationally infeasible.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"If bounds on path length are known, it is straightforward to adapt these dynamic programs to efficiently consider paths of all lengths.",5 Learning and inference,[0],[0]
"As one of the main advantages of this approach is its generality, we evaluate on several different benchmark tasks for instruction following.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
These exhibit great diversity in both environment structure and language use.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]

"Map reading Our first application is the map navigation task established by Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), based on data collected for a psychological experiment by Anderson et al. (1991) (Figure 1a).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Each training datum consists of a map with a designated starting position, and a collection of landmarks, each labeled with a spatial coordinate and a string name.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Names are not always unique, and landmarks in the test set are never observed during training.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This map is accompanied by a set of instructions specifying a path from the starting position to some (unlabeled) destination point.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"These instruction sets are informal and redundant, involving as many as a hundred utterances.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"They are transcribed from spoken text, so grammatical errors, disfluencies, etc. are common.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This is a
prime example of a domain that does not lend itself to logical representation—grammars may be too rigid, and previously-unseen landmarks and real-valued positions are handled more easily with feature machinery than predicate logic.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The map task was previously studied by Vogel and Jurafsky (2010), who implemented SARSA with a simple set of features.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"By combining these features with our alignment model and search procedure, we achieve state-of-the-art results on this task by a substantial margin (Table 1).
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Some learned feature values are shown in Table 2.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The model correctly infers cardinal directions (the example shows the preferred side of a destination landmark modified by the word top).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Like Vogel et al., we see support for both allocentric references (you are on top of the hill) and egocentric references (the hill is on top of you).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We can also see pragmatics at work: the model learns useful text-independent constraints—in this case, that near destinations should be preferred to far ones.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Maze navigation The next application we consider is the maze navigation task of MacMahon et al. (2006) (Figure 1b).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, a virtual agent is sit-
uated in a maze (whose hallways are distinguished with various wallpapers, carpets, and the presence of a small set of standard objects), and again given instructions for getting from one point to another.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This task has been the subject of focused attention in semantic parsing for several years, resulting in a variety of sophisticated approaches.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Despite superficial similarity to the previous navigation task, the language and plans required for this task are quite different.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The proportion of instructions to actions is much higher (so redundancy much lower), and the interpretation of language is highly compositional.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in Table 3, we outperform a number of systems purpose-built for this navigation task.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We also outperform both variants of our system, most conspicuously the variant without grounding graphs.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This highlights the importance of compositional structure.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Recent work by Kim and Mooney (2013) and Artzi et al. (2014) has achieved better results; these systems make use of techniques and resources (respectively, discriminative reranking and a seed lexicon of handannotated logical forms) that are largely orthogonal to the ones used here, and might be applied to improve our own results as well.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Puzzle solving The last task we consider is the Crossblock task studied by Branavan et al. (2009) (Figure 1c).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, again, natural language is used to specify a sequence of actions, in this case the solution to a simple game.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The environment is simple enough to be captured with a flat feature

",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"representation, so there is no distinction between the full model and the variant without grounding graphs.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Unlike the other tasks we consider, Crossblock is distinguished by a challenging associated search problem.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Here it is nontrivial to find any sequence that eliminates all the blocks (the goal of the puzzle).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Thus this example allows us measure the effectiveness of our search procedure.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Results are shown in Table 4.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"As can be seen, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task when attempting to match the humanspecified plan exactly.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"If we are purely concerned with task completion (i.e. solving the puzzle, perhaps not with the exact set of moves specified in the instructions) we can measure this directly.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Here, too, we substantially outperform a no-text baseline.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Thus it can be seen that text induces a useful heuristic, allowing the model to solve a considerable fraction of problem instances not solved by naı̈ve beam search.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The problem of inducing planning heuristics from side information like text is an important one in its own right, and future work might focus specifically on coupling our system with a more sophisticated planner.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Even at present, the results in this section demonstrate the importance of lookahead and high-level reasoning in instruction following.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"We have described a new alignment-based compositional model for following sequences of natural language instructions, and demonstrated the effectiveness of this model on a variety of tasks.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"A fully general solution to the problem of contextual interpretation must address a wide range of wellstudied problems, but the work we have described
here provides modular interfaces for the study of a number of fundamental linguistic issues from a machine learning perspective.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"These include:
Pragmatics How do we respond to presupposition failures, and choose among possible interpretations of an instruction disambiguated only by context?",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The mechanism provided by the sequence-prediction architecture we have described provides a simple answer to this question, and our experimental results demonstrate that the learned pragmatics aid interpretation of instructions in a number of concrete ways: ambiguous references are resolved by proximity in the map reading task, missing steps are inferred from an environment model in the maze navigation task, and vague hints are turned into real plans by knowledge of the rules in Crossblock.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"A more comprehensive solution might explicitly describe the process by which instruction-givers’ own beliefs (expressed as distributions over sequences) give rise to instructions.
",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Compositional semantics,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The graph alignment model of semantics presented here is an expressive and computationally efficient generalization of classical logical techniques to accommodate environments like the map task, or those explored in our previous work (Andreas and Klein, 2014).",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"More broadly, our model provides a compositional approach to semantics that does not require an explicit formal language for encoding sentence meaning.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Future work might extend this approach to tasks like question answering, where logicbased approaches have been successful.
",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Our primary goal in this paper has been to explore methods for integrating compositional semantics and the pragmatic context provided by sequential structures.,7 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"While there is a great deal of work left to do, we find it encouraging that this general approach results in substantial gains across multiple tasks and contexts.",7 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"With more than one hundred thousand new scholarly articles being published each year, there is a rapid growth in the number of citations for the relevant scientific articles.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this context, we highlight the following interesting facts about the process of citing scientific articles: (i) the most commonly cited paper by Gerard Salton, titled “A Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval” (alleged to have been published in 1975) does not actually exist in reality (Dubin, 2004), (ii) the scientific authors read only 20% of the works they cite (Simkin and Roychowdhury, 2003), (iii) one third of the refer-
ences in a paper are redundant and 40% are perfunctory (Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975), (iv) 62.7% of the references could not be attributed a specific function (definition, tool etc.)",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"(Teufel et al., 2006).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Despite these facts, the existing bibliographic metrics consider that all citations are equally significant.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we would emphasize the fact that all the references of a paper are not equally influential.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, we believe that for our current paper, (Wan and Liu, 2014) is more influential reference than (Garfield, 2006), although the former has received lower citations (9) than the latter (1650) so far1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Therefore the influence of a cited paper completely depends upon the context of the citing paper, not the overall citation count of the cited paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We further took the opinion of the original authors of few selective papers and realized that around 16% of the references in a paper are highly influential, and the rest are trivial (Section 4).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This motivates us to design a prediction model, GraLap to automatically label the influence of a cited paper with respect to a citing paper.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here, we label paper-reference pairs rather than references alone, because a reference that is influential for one citing paper may not be influential with equal extent for another citing paper.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We experiment with ACL Anthology Network (AAN) dataset and show that GraLap along with the novel feature set, quite efficiently, predicts the intensity of references of papers, which achieves (Pearson) correlation of 0.90 with the human annotations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, we present four interesting appli-

cations to show the efficacy of considering unequal intensity of references, compared to the uniform intensity.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The contributions of the paper are four-fold: (i) we acquire a rich annotated dataset where paperreference pairs are labeled based on the influence scores (Section 4), which is perhaps the first goldstandard for this kind of task; (ii) we propose a graph-based label propagation model GraLap for semi-supervised learning which has tremendous potential for any task where the training set is less in number and labels are non-uniformly distributed (Section 3); (iii) we propose a diverse set of features (Section 3.3); most of them turn out to be quite effective to fit into the prediction model and yield improved results (Section 5); (iv) we present four applications to show how incorporating the reference intensity enhances the performance of several stateof-the-art systems (Section 6).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
All the references of a paper usually do not carry equal intensity/strength with respect to the citing paper because some papers have influenced the research more than others.,2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"To pin down this intuition, here we discretize the reference intensity by numerical values within the range of 1 to 5, (5: most influential, 1: least influential).",2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"The appropriate definitions of different labels of reference intensity are presented in Figure 1, which are also the basis of building the annotated dataset (see Section 4):
Note that “reference intensity” and “reference similarity” are two different aspects.",2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
It might happen that two similar reference are used with different intensity levels in a citing paper – while one is just mentioned somewhere in the paper and other is used as a baseline.,2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"Here, we address the former problem as a semi-supervised learning problem with clues taken from content of the citing and cited papers.",2 Defining Intensity of References,[0],[0]
"In this section, we formally define the problem and introduce our prediction model.",3 Reference Intensity Prediction Model,[0],[0]
"We are given a set of papers P = {P1, P2, ..., PM} and a sets of references R = {R1, R2, ..., RM}, where Ri corresponds to the set of references (or cited papers) of Pi.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"There is a set of papers PL ∈ P whose references RL ∈ R are already labeled by ` ∈ L = {1, ..., 5} (each reference is labeled with exactly one value).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Our objective is to define a predictive function f that labels the references RU ∈ {R \ RL} of the papers PU ∈ {P \ PL} whose reference intensities are unknown, i.e., f : (P,R, PL, RL, PU , RL) −→ L.
Since the size of the annotated (labeled) data is much smaller than unlabeled data (|PL| |PU |), we consider it as a semi-supervised learning problem.

"Each entry x ∈ X is represented by a set of features {f1, f2, ..., fD}.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"The problem is to determine the unknown labels using X and YL.
3.2 GraLap: A Prediction Model We propose GraLap, a variant of label propagation (LP) model proposed by (Zhu et al., 2003) where a node in the graph propagates its associated label to its neighbors based on the proximity.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
We intend to assign same label to the vertices which are closely connected.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"However unlike the traditional LP model where the original values of the labels continue to fade as the algorithm progresses, we systematically handle this problem in GraLap.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Additionally, we follow a post-processing in order to handle “classimbalance problem”.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Graph Creation.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"The algorithm starts with the creation of a fully connected weighted graph G = (X,E) where nodes are data points and the weight wij of each edge eij ∈ E is determined by the radial basis function as follows:

"Later in this section, we shall discuss how σ is selected.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Each node is allowed to propagate its label to its neighbors through edges (the more the edge weight, the easy to propagate).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Transition Matrix.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]

Label Matrix.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Here, we allow a soft label (interpreted as a distribution of labels) to be associated with each node.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"We then define a label matrix Y|X|×|L|, where ith row indicates the label distribution for node xi.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Initially, Y contains only the values of the labeled data; others are zero.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Label Propagation Algorithm.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"This algorithm works as follows:
After initializing Y and T , the algorithm starts by disseminating the label from one node to its neighbors (including self-loop) in one step (Step 3).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Then we normalize each entry of Y by the sum of its cor-

Step 5 is crucial; here we want the labeled sources XL to be persistent.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"During the iterations, the initial labeled nodes XL may fade away with other labels.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Therefore we forcefully restore their actual label by setting yil = 1 (if xi ∈ XL is originally labeled as l), and other entries (∀j 6=lyij) by zero.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
We keep on “pushing” the labels from the labeled data points which in turn pushes the class boundary through high density data points and settles in low density space.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"In this way, our approach intelligently uses the unlabeled data in the intermediate steps of the learning.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Assigning Final Labels.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Once YU is computed, one may take the most likely label from the label distribution for each unlabeled data.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"However, this approach does not guarantee the label proportion observed in the annotated data (which in this case is not well-separated as shown in Section 4).",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we adopt a label-based normalization technique.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"Assume that the label proportions in the labeled data are c1, ..., c|L| (s.t. ∑|L| i=1",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
ci = 1).,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"In case of YU , we try to balance the label proportion observed in the ground-truth.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
"The label mass is the column sum of YU , denoted by YU.1 , ..., YU.|L| , each of which is scaled in such a way that YU.1 : ... : YU.|L| = c1 : ... : c|L|.",3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
The label of an unlabeled data point is finalized as the label with maximum value in the row of Y .,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Convergence.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]
Here we briefly show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge.,3.1 Problem Definition,[0],[0]

The hardest challenge in this task is that there is no publicly available dataset where references are annotated with the intensity value.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we constructed our own annotated dataset in two different ways.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
(i) Expert Annotation: we requested members of our research group4 to participate in this survey.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"To facilitate the labeling process, we designed a portal where all the papers present in our dataset are enlisted in a drop-down menu.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Upon selecting a paper, its corresponding references were shown with five possible intensity values.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
The citing and cited papers are also linked to the original texts so that the annotators can read the original papers.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
A total of 20 researchers participated and they were asked to label as many paperreference pairs as they could based on the definitions of the intensity provided in Section 2.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
The annotation process went on for one month.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Out of total 1640 pairs annotated, 1270 pairs were taken such that each pair was annotated by at least two annotators, and the final intensity value of the pair was considered to be the average of the scores.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
The Pearson correlation and Kendell’s τ among the annotators are 0.787 and 0.712 respectively.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
(ii) Author Annotation: we believe that the authors of a paper are the best experts to judge the intensity of references present in the paper.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"With this intension, we launched a survey where we requested the authors whose papers are present in our dataset with significant numbers.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
We designed a web portal in similar fashion mentioned earlier; but each author was only shown her own papers in the drop-down menu.,4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]
"Out of 35 requests, 22 authors responded and total 196 pairs are annotated.",4 Dataset and Annotation,[0],[0]

Influential papers in a particular area are often discovered by considering equal weights to all the citations of a paper.,6.1 Discovering Influential Articles,[0],[0]

"To show this, Here we use the following measures individually to compute the influence of a paper: (i) RawCite: total number of citations per paper, (ii) RawPR: we construct a citation network (nodes: papers, links: citations), and measure PageRank (Page et al., 1998) of each node n: PR(n) = 1−qN + q ∑ m∈M(n) PR(m)",6.1 Discovering Influential Articles,[0],[0]

However they too could benefit from filtering or weighting references with a model of influence.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]

"To score sentences, we use a scoring function based on Naı̈ve Bayes classification.",2 Related works,[0],[0]

MT evaluation metrics are tested for correlation with human judgments either at the sentence- or the corpus-level. Trained metrics ignore corpus-level judgments and are trained for high sentence-level correlation only. We show that training only for one objective (sentence or corpus level), can not only harm the performance on the other objective, but it can also be suboptimal for the objective being optimized. To this end we present a metric trained for corpus-level and show empirical comparison against a metric trained for sentencelevel exemplifying how their performance may vary per language pair, type and level of judgment. Subsequently we propose a model trained to optimize both objectives simultaneously and show that it is far more stable than–and on average outperforms– both models on both objectives.",text,[0],[0]
"Ever since BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) many proposals for an improved automatic evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) have been made.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Some proposals use additional information for extracting quality indicators, like paraphrasing (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), syntactic trees (Liu and Gildea, 2005; Stanojević and Sima’an, 2015) or shallow semantics (Rios et al., 2011; Lo et al., 2012) etc.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Whereas others use different matching strategies, like n-grams (Papineni et al., 2002), treelets (Liu and Gildea, 2005) and skip-bigrams (Lin and Och, 2004).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most metrics use several indicators of translation quality which are often combined in a linear model whose weights are estimated on a training set of human judgments.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Because the most widely available type of human judgments are relative ranking (RR) judgments, the main machine learning method used for training the metrics were based on the learningto-rank framework (Li, 2011).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the effectiveness of this framework for training evaluation metrics has been confirmed many times, e.g., (Ye et al., 2007; Duh, 2008; Stanojević and Sima’an, 2014; Ma et al., 2016), so far there is no prior work exploring alternative objective functions for training learning-to-rank models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Without exception, all existing learning-to-rank models are trained to rank sentences while completely ignoring the corpora judgments, likely because human judgments come in the form of sentence rankings.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It might seem that sentence and corpus level tasks are very similar but that is not the case.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Empirically it has been shown that many metrics that perform well on the sentence level do not perform well on the corpus level and vice versa.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"By training to rank sentences the model does not necessarily learn to give scores that are well scaled, but only to give higher scores to better translations.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Training for the corpus level score would force the metric to give well scaled scores on the sentence level.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Human judgments of sentences can be aggregated in different ways to hypothesize human judgments of full corpora.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this fact has not been used so far to train learning-to-rank models that are good for ranking different corpora.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This work fills-in this gap by exploring the merits of different objective functions that take corpus level judgments into consideration.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We first create a learning-to-rank model for ranking corpora and compare it to the standard learning-to-rank model that is trained for ranking sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This comparison shows that performance of these two objectives can vary radically depending on the chosen meta-evaluation method.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To tackle this prob-
20
lem we contribute a new objective function, inspired by multi-task learning, in which we train for both objectives simultaneously.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This multiobjective model behaves a lot more stable over all methods of meta-evaluation and achieves a higher correlation than both single objective models.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"All the models that we define have one basic function in common, we call it a forward(·) function, that maps the features of any sentence to a single real number.",2 Models,[0],[0]
"That function can be any differentiable function including multi-layer neural networks as in (Ma et al., 2016), but here we will stick with the standard linear model:
forward(φ) = φTw + b
Here φ is a vector with feature values of a sentence, w is a weight vector and b is a bias term.",2 Models,[0],[0]
"Usually in training we would like to process a mini-batch of feature vectors Φ, where Φ is a matrix in which each column is a feature vector of individual sentence in the mini-batch or in the corpus.",2 Models,[0],[0]
"By using broadcasting we can rewrite the previous definition of the forward(·) function as:
forward(Φ) = ΦTw + b
Now we can define the score of a sentence as a sigmoid function applied over the output of the forward(·) function because we want to get a score between 0 and 1:
sentScore(φ) = σ(forward(φ))
",2 Models,[0],[0]
"As the corpus level score we will use just the average of sentence level scores:
corpScore(Φ) = 1
m
∑ sentScore(Φ)
where m is the number of sentences in the corpus.",2 Models,[0],[0]
Next we present several objective functions that are illustrated by the computation graph in Figure 1.,2 Models,[0],[0]
"Here we use the training objective very similar to BEER (Stanojević and Sima’an, 2014) which is a learning-to-rank framework that finds a separating hyper-plane between “good” and “bad” translations.",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"Unlike BEER, we use a max-margin objective instead of logistic regression.
",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
For each mini-batch we randomly select m human relative ranking pairwise judgments and after extracting features for all the sentences taking part in these judgments we put features in two matrices Φswin and Φslos.,2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"These matrices are structured in such a way that for judgment i the column i in Φswin contains the features of the “good” translation in the judgment and the column i in Φslos the features of the “bad” translation.
",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
We would like to maximize the average margin that would separate sentence level scores of pairs of translations in each judgment.,2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"Because the squashing sigmoid function does not influence the ranking we can directly optimize on the unsquashed forward pass and require that the margin between “good” and “bad” translation is at least 1:
∆sent = forward(Φswin)− forward(Φslos)
",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"LossSent = 1
m
∑ max(0, 1−∆sent)",2.1 Training for Sentence Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
At the corpus level we would like to do a similar thing as on the sentence level: maximize the distance between the scores of “good” and “bad” corpora.,2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"In this case we have additional information that is not present on the sentence level: we know not only which corpus is (according to humans) better, but also by how much it is better.",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"For
that we can use one of the heuristics such as the Expected Wins (Koehn, 2012).",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"We can use this information to guide the learning model by how much it should separate the scores of two corpora.
",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"For doing this we use an approach similar to Max-Margin Markov Networks (Taskar et al., 2003) where for each training instance we dynamically scale the margin that should be enforced.",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
We want the margin between the scores ∆corp to be at least as big as the margin between the human scores ∆human assigned to these systems.,2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
In one mini-batch we will use only a randomly chosen pair of corpora with feature matrices Φcwin and Φclos for which we have a human comparison.,2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"The corpus level loss function is given by:
∆corp = corpScore(Φcwin)− corpScore(Φclos) LossCorp = max(0,∆human −∆corp)",2.2 Training for Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"In this model we optimize both objectives jointly in the style of multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997).",2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"Here we employ the simplest approach of just tasking the interpolation of the previously introduced loss functions.
",2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
LossJoint = α · LossSent + (1− α) ·,2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
"LossCorp
The interpolation is controlled by the hyperparameter α which could in principle be tuned for good performance, but here we just fix it to 0.5 to give both objectives equal importance.",2.3 Training Jointly for Sentence and Corpus Level Accuracy,[0],[0]
The feature functions that are used are reimplementation of many (but not all) feature functions of BEER.,2.4 Feature Functions,[0],[0]
"Because the point of this paper is about the exploration of different objective functions we did not try to experiment with more complex feature functions based on paraphrasing, function words or permutation trees.

"We use just simple precision, recall and 3 types of F-score (with β parameters 1, 2 and 0.5) over different “pieces” of translation:

"Experiments are conducted on WMT13 (Macháček and Bojar, 2013), WMT14 (Machacek and Bojar, 2014) and WMT16 (Bojar et al., 2016) datasets which were used as training, validation and testing datasets respectively.

All of the models are implemented using TensorFlow1 and trained with L2 regularization λ = 0.001 and ADAM optimizer with learning rate 0.001.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]

We show the results for the relative ranking (RR) judgments correlation in Table 1.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]

"RR corpus vs. sentence objective The corpusobjective is better than the sentence-objective for both corpus and sentence level RR judgments on 5 out of 7 languages and also on average correlation.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"RR joint vs. single-objectives Training for the joint objective improves even more on both levels of RR correlation and outperforms both singleobjective models on average and on 4 out of 7 languages.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"Making confident conclusions from these results is difficult because, to the best of our knowledge, there is no principled way of measuring statistical significance on the RR judgments.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
That is why we also tested on direct assessment (DA) judgments available from WMT16.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On DA we can measure statistical significance on the sentence level using Williams test (Graham et al., 2015) and on the corpus level using combination of hybrid-supersampling and Williams test (Graham and Liu, 2016).",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"The results of correlation with human judgment are for sentence and corpus level are shown in Table 2.

DA corpus vs. other objectives On DA judgments the results for corpus level objective are completely different than on the RR judgments.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On DA judgments the corpus-objective model is significantly outperformed on both levels and on all languages by both of the other objectives.

This shows that gambling on one objective function (being that sentence or corpus level objective) could give unpredictable results.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"This is precisely the motivation for creating the joint model with multi-objective training.
",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
DA joint vs. single objectives By choosing to jointly optimize both objectives we get a much more stable model that performs well both on DA and RR judgments and on both levels of judgment.,3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On the DA sentence level, the joint model was not outperformed by any other model and on 3 out of 7 language pairs it significantly outperforms both alternative objectives.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
"On the corpus level results are
a bit mixed, but still joint objective outperforms both other models on 4 out of 7 language pairs and also it gives higher correlation on average.",3 Experiments,[0],[0]
In this work we found that altering the objective function for training MT metrics can have radical effects on performance.,4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
Also the effects of the objective functions can sometimes be unexpected: the sentence objective might not be good for sentence level correlation (in case of RR judgments) and the corpus objective might not be good for corpus level correlation (in case of DA judgments).,4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The difference among objectives is better explained by different types of human judgments: the corpus objective is better for RR while sentence objective is better for DA judgments.
",4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Finally, the best results are achieved by training for both objectives at the same time.",4 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This gives
an evaluation metric that is far more stable in its performance over all methods of meta-evaluation.",4 Conclusion,[0],[0]

MT evaluation metrics are tested for correlation with human judgments either at the sentenceor the corpus-level.,abstractText,[0],[0]
Trained metrics ignore corpus-level judgments and are trained for high sentence-level correlation only.,abstractText,[0],[0]
"We show that training only for one objective (sentence or corpus level), can not only harm the performance on the other objective, but it can also be suboptimal for the objective being optimized.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"To this end we present a metric trained for corpus-level and show empirical comparison against a metric trained for sentencelevel exemplifying how their performance may vary per language pair, type and level of judgment.",abstractText,[0],[0]

"Over the past few years, Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs, Banarescu et al. (2013)) have become a popular target representation for semantic parsing.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
AMRs are graphs which describe the predicate-argument structure of a sentence.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Because they are graphs and not trees, they can capture reentrant semantic relations, such as those induced by control verbs and coordination.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, it is technically much more challenging to parse a string into a graph than into a tree.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, grammar-based approaches (Peng et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015) require the induction of a grammar from the training corpus, which is hard because graphs can be decomposed into smaller pieces in far more ways than trees.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Neural sequence-to-sequence models, which do very well on string-to-tree parsing (Vinyals et al., 2014), can be applied to AMRs but face the challenge that graphs cannot easily be represented as sequences (van Noord and Bos, 2017a,b).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we tackle this challenge by making the compositional structure of the AMR explicit.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As in our previous work, Groschwitz et al. (2017), we view an AMR as consisting of atomic graphs representing the meanings of the individual words,
which were combined compositionally using linguistically motivated operations for combining a head with its arguments and modifiers.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We represent this structure as terms over the AM algebra as defined in Groschwitz et al. (2017).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This previous work had no parser; here we show that the terms of the AM algebra can be viewed as dependency trees over the string, and we train a dependency parser to map strings into such trees, which we then evaluate into AMRs in a postprocessing step.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The dependency parser relies on type information, which encodes the semantic valencies of the atomic graphs, to guide its decisions.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More specifically, we combine a neural supertagger for identifying the elementary graphs for the individual words with a neural dependency model along the lines of Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016) for identifying the operations of the algebra.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
One key challenge is that the resulting term of the AM algebra must be semantically well-typed.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This makes the decoding problem NP-complete.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We present two approximation algorithms: one which takes the unlabeled dependency tree as given, and one which assumes that all dependencies are projective.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We evaluate on two data sets, achieving state-of-the-art results on one and near state-of-theart results on the other (Smatch f-scores of 71.0 and 70.2 respectively).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our approach clearly outperforms strong but non-compositional baselines.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Plan of the paper.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"After reviewing related work in Section 2, we explain the AM algebra in Section 3 and extend it to a dependency view in Section 4.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We explain model training in Section 5 and decoding in Section 6.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Section 7 evaluates a number of variants of our system.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recently, AMR parsing has generated considerable research activity, due to the availability of large-
scale annotated data (Banarescu et al., 2013) and two successful SemEval Challenges (May, 2016; May and Priyadarshi, 2017).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Methods from dependency parsing have been shown to be very successful for AMR parsing.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"For instance, the JAMR parser (Flanigan et al., 2014, 2016) distinguishes concept identification (assigning graph fragments to words) from relation identification (adding graph edges which connect these fragments), and solves the former with a supertagging-style method and the latter with a graph-based dependency parser.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Foland and Martin (2017) use a variant of this method based on an intricate neural model, yielding state-of-the-art results.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"We go beyond these approaches by explicitly modeling the compositional structure of the AMR, which allows the dependency parser to combine AMRs for the words using a small set of universal operations, guided by the types of these AMRs.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Other recent methods directly implement a dependency parser for AMRs, e.g. the transitionbased model of Damonte et al. (2017), or postprocess the output of a dependency parser by adding missing edges (Du et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast to these, our model makes no strong assumptions on the dependency parsing algorithm that is used; here we choose that of Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The commitment of our parser to derive AMRs compositionally mirrors that of grammar-based AMR parsers (Artzi et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2015).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In particular, there are parallels between the types we use in the AM algebra and CCG categories (see Section 3 for details).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As a neural system, our parser struggles less with coverage issues than these, and avoids the complex grammar induction process these models require.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More generally, our use of semantic types to restrict our parser is reminiscent of Kwiatkowski et al. (2010), Krishnamurthy et al. (2017) and Zhang et al. (2017), and the idea of deriving semantic representations from dependency trees is also present in Reddy et al. (2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"A core idea of this paper is to parse a string into a graph by instead parsing a string into a dependencystyle tree representation of the graph’s compositional structure, represented as terms of the ApplyModify (AM) algebra (Groschwitz et al., 2017).
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The values of the AM algebra are annotated s-
graphs, or as-graphs: directed graphs with node and edge labels in which certain nodes have been designated as sources (Courcelle and Engelfriet, 2012) and annotated with type information.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Some examples of as-graphs are shown in Fig. 1.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Each as-graph has exactly one root, indicated by the bold outline.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The sources are indicated by red labels; for instance, Gwant has an S-source and an O-source.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The annotations, written in square brackets behind the red source names, will be explained below.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"We use these sources to mark open argument slots; for example, Gsleep in Fig. 1 represents an intransitive verb, missing its subject, which will be added at the S-source.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The AM algebra can combine as-graphs with each other using two linguistically motivated operations: apply and modify.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Apply (APP) adds an argument to a predicate.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, we can add a subject – the graph Gwriter in Fig. 1 – to the graph GVP in Fig. 2d using APPS, yielding the complete AMR in Fig. 2b.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Linguistically, this is like filling the subject (S) slot of the predicate wants to sleep soundly with the argument the writer.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In general, for a source a, APPa(GP , GA), combines the asgraph GP representing a predicate, or head, with the as-graph GA, which represents an argument.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"It does this by plugging the root node of GA into the a-source u of GP – that is, the node u of GP marked with source a.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"The root of the resulting as-graph G is the root of GP , and we remove the a marking on u, since that slot is now filled.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The modify operation (MOD) adds a modifier to a graph.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, we can combine two elementary graphs from Fig. 1 with MODm (Gsleep, Gsound), yielding the graph in Fig. 2c.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The Msource of the modifier Gsoundly attaches to the root of Gsleep.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
The root of the result is the same as the root of Gsleep in the same sense that a verb phrase with an adverb modifier is still a verb phrase.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In general, MODa(GH , GM ), combines a head GH with a modifier GM .",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
It plugs the root of GH into the a-source u of GM .,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Although this may add incoming edges to the root of GH , that node is still
the root of the resulting graph G. We remove the a marking from GM .
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In both APP and MOD, if there is any other source b which is present in both graphs, the nodes marked with b are unified with each other.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, when Gwant is O-applied to t1 in Fig. 2d, the S-sources of the graphs for “want” and “sleep soundly” are unified into a single node, creating a reentrancy.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"This falls out of the definition of merge for s-graphs which formally underlies both operations (see (Courcelle and Engelfriet, 2012)).
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Finally, the AM algebra uses types to restrict its operations.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Here we define the type of an as-graph as the set of its sources with their annotations1; thus for example, in Fig. 1, the graph for “writer” has the empty type [ ],Gsleep has type [S], andGwant has type [S, O[S]].",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Each source in an as-graph specifies with its annotation the type of the as-graph which is plugged into it via APP.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In other words, for a source a, we may only a-apply GP with GA if the annotation of the a-source in GP matches the type of GA.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"For example, the O-source of Gwants (Fig. 1) requires that we plug in an as-graph of type [S]; observe that this means that the reentrancy in Fig.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
2b is lexically specified by the control verb “want”.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"All other source nodes in Fig. 1 have no annotation, indicating a type requirement of [ ].
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Linguistically, modification is optional; we therefore want the modified graph to be derivationally just like the unmodified graph, in that exactly the same operations can apply to it.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In a typed algebra, this means MOD should not change the type of the head.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"MODa therefore requires that the modifier GM have no sources not already present in the head GH , except a, which will be deleted anyway.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"As in any algebra, we can build terms from constants (denoting elementary as-graphs) by recursively combining them with the operations of the AM algebra.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"By evaluating the operations bottomup, we obtain an as-graph as the value of such a term; see Fig. 2 for an example.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"However, as discussed above, an operation in the term may be undefined due to a type mismatch.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
We call an AMterm well-typed if all its operations are defined.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Every well-typed AM-term evaluates to an as-graph.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Since the applicability of an AM operation depends only on the types, we also write τ = f(τ1, τ2) if as-graphs of type τ1 and τ2 can be combined with the operation f and the result has type τ .
1See (Groschwitz et al., 2017) for a more formally complete definition.
",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
Relationship to CCG.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
There is close relationship between the types of the AM algebra and the categories of CCG.,3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"A type [S, O] specifies that the as-graph needs to be applied to two arguments to be semantically complete, similar a CCG category such as S\NP/NP, where a string needs to be applied to two NP arguments to be syntactically complete.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"However, AM types govern the combination of graphs, while CCG categories control the combination of strings.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"This relieves AM types of the need to talk about word order; there are no “forward” or “backward” slashes in AM types, and a smaller set of operations.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"Also, the AM algebra spells out raising and control phenomena more explicitly in the types.",3 The AM algebra,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we connect AM terms to the input string w for which we want to produce a graph.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"We do this in an indexed AM term, exemplified in Fig. 3a.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"We assume that every elementary as-graph G at a leaf represents the meaning of an individual word token wi in w, and write G[i] to annotate the leaf G with the index i of this token.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"This induces a connection between the nodes of the AMR and the tokens of the string, in that the label of each node was contributed by the elementary as-graph of exactly one token.
",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
We define the head index of a subtree t to be the index of the token which contributed the root of the as-graph to which t evaluates.,4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"For a leaf with annotation i, the head index is i; for an APP or MOD node, the head index is the head index of the left child, i.e. of the head argument.",4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
We annotate each APP and MOD operation with the head index of the left and right subtree.,4 Indexed AM terms,[0],[0]
"We can represent indexed AM terms more compactly as AM dependency trees, as shown in Fig.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
3b.,4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
The nodes of such a dependency tree are the tokens of w. We draw an edge with label f from i to k if there is a node with label f,4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"[i, k] in the indexed AM term.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"For example, the tree in 3b has an edge labeled MODm from 5 (Gsleep) to 6 (Gsoundly) because there is a node in the term in 3a labeled MODm[5, 6].",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"The same AM dependency tree may represent multiple indexed AM terms, because the order of apply and modify operations is not specified in the dependency tree.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]

"As a special case, we allow the constant ⊥, which represents a dummy as-graph (of type ⊥) which we use as the semantic value of words without a semantic value in the AMR.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"We furthermore allow the edge label IGNORE in an AM dependency tree, where IGNORE(τ1, τ2) = τ1 if τ2 = ⊥ and is undefined otherwise; in particular, an AM dependency tree with IGNORE edges is only well-typed if all IGNORE edges point into ⊥ nodes.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"We keep all other operations f(τ1, τ2) as is, i.e. they are undefined if either τ1 or τ2 is⊥, and never yield ⊥ as a result.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"When reconstructing an AM term from the AM dependency tree, we skip IGNORE edges, such that the subtree below them will not contribute to the overall AMR.",4.1 AM dependency trees,[0],[0]
"In order to train a model that parses sentences into AM dependency trees, we need to convert an AMR corpus – in which sentences are annotated with AMRs – into a treebank of AM dependency trees.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We do this in three steps: first, we break each AMR up into elementary graphs and identify their roots; second, we assign sources and annotations to make elementary as-graphs out of them; and third, combine them into indexed AM terms.
",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"For the first step, an aligner uses hand-written heuristics to identify the string token to which each
node in the AMR corresponds (see Section C in the Supplementary Materials for details).",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We proceed in a similar fashion as the JAMR aligner (Flanigan et al., 2014), i.e. by starting from high-confidence token-node pairs and then extending them until the whole AMR is covered.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"Unlike the JAMR aligner, our heuristics ensure that exactly one node in each elementary graph is marked as the root, i.e. as the node where other graphs can attach their edges through APP and MOD.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"When an edge connects nodes of two different elementary graphs, we use the “blob decomposition” algorithm of Groschwitz et al. (2017) to decide to which elementary graph it belongs.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"For the example AMR in Fig. 2b, we would obtain the graphs in Fig. 1 (without source annotations).",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"Note that ARG edges belong with the nodes at which they start, whereas the “manner” edge in Gsoundly goes with its target.
",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
In the second step we assign source names and annotations to the unlabeled nodes of each elementary graph.,4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
Note that the annotations are crucial to our system’s ability to generate graphs with reentrancies.,4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We mostly follow the algorithm of Groschwitz et al. (2017), which determines necessary annotations based on the structure of the given graph.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
The algorithm chooses each source name depending on the incoming edge label.,4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"For instance, the two leaves of Gwant can have the source labels S and O because they have incoming edges labeled ARG0 and ARG1.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"However, the Groschwitz algorithm is not deterministic: It allows object promotion (the sources for an ARG3 edge may be O3, O2, or O), unaccusative subjects (promoting the minimal object to S if the elementary graph contains an ARGi-edge (i > 0) but no ARG0-edge (Perlmutter, 1978)), and passive alternation (swapping O and S).",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"To make our as-graphs more consistent, we prefer constants that promote objects as far as possible, use unaccusative subjects, and no passive alternation, but still allow constants that do not satisfy these conditions if necessary.",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"This increased our Smatch score significantly.
",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"Finally, we choose an arbitrary AM dependency
tree that combines the chosen elementary as-graphs into the annotated AMR; in practice, the differences between the trees seem to be negligible.2",4.2 Converting AMRs to AM terms,[0],[0]
"We can now model the AMR parsing task as the problem of computing the best well-typed AM dependency tree t for a given sentence w. Because t is well-typed, it can be decoded into an (indexed) AM term and thence evaluated to an as-graph.

"The projective decoder assumes that the AM dependency tree is projective, i.e. has no crossing dependency edges.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Because of this assumption, it can recursively combine adjacent substrings using dynamic programming.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"The algorithm is shown in Fig. 5 as a parsing schema (Shieber et al., 1995), which derives items of the form ([i, k], r, τ) with scores s. An item represents a well-typed derivation of the substring from i to k with head index r, and which evaluates to an as-graph of type τ .
",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"The parsing schema consists of three types of
rules.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"First, the Init rule generates an item for each graph fragment G[i] that the supertagger predicted for the token wi, along with the score and type of that graph fragment.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Second, given items for adjacent substrings [i, j] and [j, k], the Arc rules apply an operation f to combine the indexed AM terms for the two substrings, with Arc-R making the left-hand substring the head and the right-hand substring the argument or modifier, and Arc-L the other way around.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
We ensure that the result is well-typed by requiring that the types can be combined with f .,6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Finally, the Skip rules allow us to extend a substring such that it covers tokens which do not correspond to a graph fragment (i.e., their AM term is ⊥), introducing IGNORE edges.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"After all possible items have been derived, we extract the best well-typed tree from the item of the form ([1, n], r, τ) with the highest score, where τ =",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"[ ].
",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"Because we keep track of the head indices, the projective decoder is a bilexical parsing algorithm, and shares a parsing complexity of O(n5) with other bilexical algorithms such as the Collins parser.",6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
It could be improved to a complexity of O(n4) using the algorithm of Eisner and Satta (1999).,6.1 Projective decoder,[0],[0]
"The fixed-tree decoder computes the best unlabeled dependency tree tr for w, using the edge scores ω(i→ k), and then computes the best AM dependency tree forw whose unlabeled version is tr.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"The Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm produces a forest of dependency trees, which we want to combine into tr.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"We choose the tree whose root r has the highest score for being the root of the AM dependency tree and make the roots of all others children of r.
At this point, the shape of tr is fixed.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"We choose
supertags for the nodes and edge labels for the edges by traversing tr bottom-up, computing types for the subtrees as we go along.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"Formally, we apply the parsing schema in Fig. 6.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"It uses items of the form (i, C, τ) : s, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n is a node of tr, C is the set of children of i for which we have already chosen edge labels, and τ is a type.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"We write Ch(i) for the set of children of i in tr.
",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"The Init rule generates an item for each graph that the supertagger can assign to each token i in w, ensuring that every token is also assigned ⊥ as a possible supertag.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"The Edge rule labels an edge from a parent node i in tr to one of its children k, whose children already have edge labels.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"As above, this rule ensures that a well-typed AM dependency tree is generated by locally checking the types.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]
"In particular, if all types τ2 that can be derived for k are incompatible with τ1, we fall back to an item for k with τ2 = ⊥ (which always exists), along with an IGNORE edge from i to k.
The complexity of this algorithm is O(n · 2d · d), where d is the maximal arity of the nodes in tr.",6.2 Fixed-tree decoder,[0],[0]

"We replace these node labels with LEX in preprocessing, reducing the number of different elementary as-graphs from 28730 to 2370.",7.2 Pre- and postprocessing,[0],[0]

Abstract
This paper addresses the task of AMR-totext generation by leveraging synchronous node replacement grammar. During training, graph-to-string rules are learned using a heuristic extraction algorithm. At test time, a graph transducer is applied to collapse input AMRs and generate output sentences. Evaluated on a standard benchmark, our method gives the state-of-the-art result.",text,[0],[0]

of all, the percentage of rules containing nonterminals are much more than those without nonterminals, as we collapse each pair of initial rules (in Algorithm 1) and the results can be quadratic the number of initial rules.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"In addition, most rules are small containing 1 to 3 terminals, meaning that they represent small pieces of meaning and are easier to matched on a new AMR graph.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"Finally, there are a few large rules, which represent complex meaning.
",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"Statistics on the rules used for decoding In addition, we collect the rules that our well-tuned system used for generating the 1-best output on the testset, and categorize them into 3 types: (1) glue rules, (2) nonterminal rules, which are not glue rules but contain nonterminals on the righthand side and (3) terminal rules, whose right-hand side only contain terminals.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"Over the rules used on the 1-best result, more than 30% are non-terminal rules, showing that the induced rules play an important role.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, 30% are glue rules.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"The reason is that the data sparsity for graph grammars is more severe than string-based grammars (such as CFG), as the graph structures are more complex than strings.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"Finally, terminal rules take the largest percentage, while most are induced rules, but not concept rules.
",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"Rule examples Finally, we show some rules in Table 4, where F and E are the right-hand-side AMR fragment and phrase, respectively.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"For the first rule, the root of F is a verb (“give-01”) whose subject is a nonterminal and object is a AMR fragment “(p / person :ARG0-of (u / use-01))”, which means “user”.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
So it is easy to see that the corresponding phrase E conveys the same meaning.,4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"For the second rule, “(s3 / stay-01 :accompanier (i / i))” means “stay
with me”, which is also covered by its phrase.",4.3 Grammar analysis,[0],[0]
"Finally, we show an example in Table 5, where the top is the input AMR graph, and the bottom is the generation result.",4.4 Generation example,[0],[0]
"Generally, most of the meaning of the input AMR are correctly translated, such as “:example”, which means “such as”, and “thing”, which is an abstract concept and should not be translated, while there are a few errors, such as “that” in the result should be “what”, and there should be an “in” between “tmt” and “fairfax”.",4.4 Generation example,[0],[0]

"A basic nonlinear dependence measure is the HilbertSchmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the covariance operator between feature mappings of the random variables (Gretton et al., 2005; 2008).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Each random variable X and Y is mapped to a respective reproducing kernel Hilbert space Hk and Hl.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For sufficiently rich mappings, the covariance operator norm is zero if and only if the variables are independent.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A second basic nonlinear dependence measure is the smoothed difference between the characteristic function of the joint distribution, and that of the product of marginals.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"When a particular smoothing function is used, the statistic corresponds to the covariance between distances ofX and Y variable pairs (Feuerverger, 1993; Székely et al., 2007; Székely & Rizzo, 2009), yielding a simple test statistic based on pairwise distances.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
It has been shown by Sejdinovic et al. (2013) that the distance covariance (and its generalization to semi-metrics) is an instance of HSIC for an appropriate choice of kernels.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A disadvantage of these feature covariance statistics, however, is that they require quadratic time to compute (besides in the special case of the distance covariance with univariate real-valued variables, where Huo & Székely (2016) achieve an O(n log n) cost).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, the feature covariance statistics have intractable null distributions, and either a permutation approach or the solution of an expensive eigenvalue problem (e.g. Zhang et al., 2011) is required for consistent estimation of the quantiles.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
Several approaches were proposed by Zhang et al. (2017) to obtain faster tests along the lines of HSIC.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"These include computing HSIC on finite-dimensional feature mappings chosen as random Fourier features (RFFs) (Rahimi & Recht, 2008), a block-averaged statistic, and a Nyström approximation to the statistic.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Key to each of these approaches is a more efficient computation of the statistic and its threshold under the null distribution: for RFFs, the null distribution is a finite weighted sum of χ2 variables; for the block-averaged statistic, the null distribution is asymptotically normal; for Nyström, either a permutation approach is employed, or the spectrum of the Nyström approximation to the kernel matrix is used in approximating the null distribution.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Each of these methods costs significantly less than theO(n2) cost of the full HSIC (the cost is linear in n, but also depends quadratically on the number of features retained).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A potential disadvantage of the Nyström and Fourier approaches is that the features are not optimized to maximize test power,
but are chosen randomly.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The block statistic performs worse than both, due to the large variance of the statistic under the null (which can be mitigated by observing more data).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition to feature covariances, correlation measures have also been developed in infinite dimensional feature spaces: in particular, Bach & Jordan (2002); Fukumizu et al. (2008) proposed statistics on the correlation operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"While convergence has been established for certain of these statistics, their computational cost is high at O(n3), and test thresholds have relied on permutation.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"A number of much faster approaches to testing based on feature correlations have been proposed, however.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, Dauxois & Nkiet (1998) compute statistics of the correlation between finite sets of basis functions, chosen for instance to be step functions or low order B-splines.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The cost of this approach is O(n).,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"This idea was extended by Lopez-Paz et al. (2013), who computed the canonical correlation between finite sets of basis functions chosen as random Fourier features; in addition, they performed a copula transform on the inputs, with a total cost of O(n log n).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, space partitioning approaches have also been proposed, based on statistics such as the KL divergence, however these apply only to univariate variables (Heller et al., 2016), or to multivariate variables of low dimension (Gretton & Györfi, 2010) (that said, these tests have other advantages of theoretical interest, notably distribution-independent test thresholds).
",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
The approach we take is most closely related to HSIC on a finite set of features.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our simplest test statistic, the Finite Set Independence Criterion (FSIC), is an average of covariances of analytic functions (i.e., features) defined on each of X and Y .",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
A normalized version of the statistic (NFSIC) yields a distribution-independent asymptotic test threshold.,1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"We show that our test is consistent, despite a finite number of analytic features being used, via a generalization of arguments in Chwialkowski et al. (2015).",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"As in recent work on two-sample testing by Jitkrittum et al. (2016), our test is adaptive in the sense that we choose our features on a held-out validation set to optimize a lower bound on the test power.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]
"The design of features for independence testing turns out to be quite different to the case of two-sample testing, however: the task is to find correlated feature pairs on the respective marginal domains, rather than attempting to find a single, high-dimensional feature representation on the tensor product of the marginals, as we would need to do if we were comparing distributions Pxy and Qxy .",1.

"While the use of coupled feature pairs on the marginals entails a smaller feature space dimension, it introduces significant complications in the proof of the lower bound, compared with the two-sample case.",1. Introduction,[0],[0]

"1 + sin(ωx) sin(ωy), where the domains of X ,Y = (−π, π) and ω is the frequency of the sinusoid.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"As the frequency ω increases, the drawn sample becomes more similar to a sample drawn from Uniform((−π, π)2).",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"That is, the higher ω, the harder to detect the dependency between X and Y .",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
This problem was studied in Sejdinovic et al. (2013).,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
Plots of the density for a few values of ω are shown in Figures 6 and 7 in the appendix.,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
The main characteristic of interest in this problem is the local change in the density function.,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]

"In particular, we point out that NFSIC-opt’s rejection rate is well controlled as the sample used for testing and the sample used for parameter tuning are independent.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"The rejection rate would have been much higher had we done the optimization and testing on the same sample (i.e., overfitting).",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]

This phenomenon clearly emphasizes the importance of the optimization to place the locations at the relevant regions in X×Y .,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"RDC has a remarkably high performance in both Sin and GSign (Figure 2c, 2d) despite no parameter tuning.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"The ability to simultaneously consider interacting features of NFSIC-opt is indicated by its superior test power in GSign, especially at the challenging settings of dx = 5, 6.
NFSIC vs. QHSIC.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
We observe that NFSIC-opt outperforms the quadratic-time QHSIC in these two problems.,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
QHSIC is defined as the RKHS norm of the witness function u (see (2)).,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, one can think of the RKHS norm as taking into account all the locations (v,w).",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"By contrast, the proposed NFSIC evaluates the witness function at J locations.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"If the differences in pxy and pxpy are local (e.g., Sin problem), or there are interacting features (e.g., GSign problem), then only small regions in the space of (X,Y ) are relevant in detecting the difference of pxy and pxpy.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"In these cases, pinpointing exact test locations by the optimization of NFSIC performs well.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, taking into account all possible test locations as done implicitly in QHSIC also integrates over regions where the difference between pxy and pxpy is small, resulting in a weaker indication of dependence.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"Whether QHSIC is better than NFSIC depends heavily on the problem, and there is no one best answer.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"If the difference between pxy and pxpy is large only in localized regions, then the proposed linear time statistic has an advantage.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"If the difference is spatially diffuse, then QHSIC has an advantage.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"No existing work has proposed a procedure to optimally tune kernel parameters for QHSIC; by contrast, NFSIC has a clearly defined objective for parameter tuning.
",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"To investigate the sample efficiency of all the tests, we fix dx = dy = 250 in SG, ω = 4 in Sin, dx = 4 in GSign, and increase n. Figure 3 shows the results.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
The quadratic dependency on n in QHSIC makes it infeasible both in terms of memory and runtime to consider n larger than 6000 (Figure 3a).,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"By constrast, although not the most time-efficient, NFSIC-opt has the highest sample-efficiency for GSign, and for Sin in the low-sample regime, significantly outperforming QHSIC.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"Despite the small additional overhead from the optimization, we are yet able to conduct an accurate test with n = 105, dx = dy = 250 in less than 100 seconds.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
We observe in Figure 3b that the two NFSIC variants have correct type-I errors across all sample sizes.,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
We recall from Theorem 5 that the NFSIC test with random test locations will asymptotically reject H0 if it is false.,3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]
"A demonstration of this property is given in Figure 3c, where the test power of NFSIC-med eventually reaches 1 with n higher than 105.",3.1. Toy Problems,[0],[0]

Most of the songs are western commercial tracks from 1922 to 2011.,3.2. Real Problems,[0],[0]
The goal is to detect the dependency between each song and its year of release (Y ).,3.2. Real Problems,[0],[0]

Other settings are the same as in the toy problems.,3.2. Real Problems,[0],[0]
"To make sure that the type-I error is correct, we use the permutation approach in the NFSIC tests to compute the threshold.",3.2. Real Problems,[0],[0]

Its test power is second to only QHSIC.,3.2. Real Problems,[0],[0]
We recall that NFSIC-opt uses half of the sample for parameter tuning.,3.2. Real Problems,[0],[0]
"Thus, at n = 500, the actual sample for testing is 250, which is relatively small.",3.2. Real Problems,[0],[0]
"The fact that there is a vast power gain from 0.4 (NFSIC-med) to 0.8 (NFSIC-opt) at n = 500 suggests that the optimization procedure can perform well even at a lower sample sizes.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new rich resource enhanced AMR aligner which produces multiple alignments and a new transition system for AMR parsing along with its oracle parser. Our aligner is further tuned by our oracle parser via picking the alignment that leads to the highestscored achievable AMR graph. Experimental results show that our aligner outperforms the rule-based aligner in previous work by achieving higher alignment F1 score and consistently improving two open-sourced AMR parsers. Based on our aligner and transition system, we develop a transition-based AMR parser that parses a sentence into its AMR graph directly. An ensemble of our parsers with only words and POS tags as input leads to 68.4 Smatch F1 score, which outperforms the parser of Wang and Xue (2017).",text,[0],[0]
"Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013) is a semantic representation which encodes the meaning of a sentence in a rooted and directed graph, whose nodes are abstract semantic concepts and edges are semantic relations between concepts (see Figure 1 for an example).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Parsing a sentence into its AMR graph has drawn a lot of research attention in recent years with a number of parsers being developed (Flanigan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015b; Pust et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016; Goodman et al., 2016; Damonte et al., 2017; Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan, 2017; Foland and Martin, 2017; Konstas et al., 2017).

"In previous works, such alignment is extracted by either greedily applying a set of heuristic rules (Flanigan et al., 2014) or adopting the unsupervised word alignment technique from machine translation (Pourdamghani et al., 2014; Wang and Xue, 2017).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The rule-based aligner – JAMR aligner proposed by Flanigan et al. (2014) is widely used in previous works thanks to its flexibility of incorporating additional linguistic resources like WordNet.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, achieving good alignments with the JAMR aligner still faces some difficult challenges.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The first challenge is deriving an optimal alignment in ambiguous situations.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Taking the sentence-AMR-graph pair in Figure 1 for example, the JAMR aligner doesn’t distinguish between the two “nuclear”s in the sentence and can yield sub-optimal alignment in which the first “nuclear” is aligned to the nucleus˜2 concept.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The second challenge is recalling more semantically matched word-concept pair without harming the
alignment precision.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The JAMR aligner adopts a rule that aligns the word-concept pair which at least have a common longest prefix of 4 characters, but omitting the shorter cases like aligning the word “actions” to the concept act-01 and the semantically matched cases like aligning the word “example” to the concept exemplify-01.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The final challenge which is faced by both the rule-based and unsupervised aligners is tuning the alignment with downstream parser learning.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Previous works treated the alignment as a fixed input.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Its quality is never evaluated and its alternatives are never explored.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"All these challenges make the JAMR aligner achieve only an alignment F1 score of about 90% and influence the performance of the trained AMR parsers.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve these challenges and improve the word-toconcept alignment, which further improves the AMR parsing performance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A rule-based aligner and a transition-based oracle AMR parser lie in the core of our method.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the aligner part, we incorporate rich semantic resources into the JAMR aligner to recall more word-concept pairs and cancel its greedily aligning process.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This leads to multiple alignment outputs with higher recall but lower precision.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For the parser part, we propose a new transition system that can parse the raw sentence into AMR graph directly.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

AMR Parsers.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
AMR parsing maps a natural language sentence into its AMR graph.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Most current parsers construct the AMR graph in a two-staged manner which first identifies concepts (nodes in the graph) from the input sentence, then identifies relations (edges in the graph) between the identified concepts.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Flanigan et al. (2014) and their follow-up works (Flanigan et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016) model the parsing problem as finding the maximum spanning connected graph.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Wang et al. (2015b) proposes to greedily transduce the dependency tree into AMR graph and a bunch of works (Wang et al., 2015a; Goodman et al., 2016; Wang and Xue, 2017) further improve the transducer’s performance with rich features and imitation learning.2 Transition-based methods
2Wang et al. (2015b) and the follow-up works refer their transducing process as “transition-based”.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, to dis-
that directly parse an input sentence into its AMR graph have also been studied (Ballesteros and AlOnaizan, 2017; Damonte et al., 2017).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In these works, the concept identification and relation identification are performed jointly.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"An aligner which maps a span of words into its concept serves to the generation of training data for the concept identifier, thus is important to the parser training.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Missing or incorrect alignments lead to poor concept identification, which then hurt the overall AMR parsing performance.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Besides the typical two-staged methods, the aligner also works in some other AMR parsing algorithms like that using syntax-based machine translation (Pust et al., 2015), sequence-to-sequence (Peng et al., 2017; Konstas et al., 2017), Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (Peng et al., 2015) and Combinatory Category Grammar (Artzi et al., 2015).
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Previous aligner works solve the alignment problem in two different ways.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The rule-based aligner (Flanigan et al., 2014) defines a set of heuristic rules which align a span of words to the graph fragment and greedily applies these rules.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The unsupervised aligner (Pourdamghani et al., 2014; Wang and Xue, 2017) uncovers the word-toconcept alignment from the linearized AMR graph through EM.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"All these approaches yield a single alignment for one sentence and its effect on the downstream parsing is not considered.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"JAMR Aligner (Flanigan et al., 2014).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Two components exist in the JAMR aligner: 1) a set of heuristic rules and 2) a greedy search process.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The heuristic rules in the JAMR aligner are a set of indicator functions ρ(c, ws,e) which take a concept c and a span of words ws,e starting from s and ending with e as input and return whether they should be aligned.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
These rules can be categorized into matching rules and updating rules.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The matching rules directly compare c with ws,e and determine if they should be aligned.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The updating rules first retrieve the concept c′ that ws,e aligns, then determine if c and ws,e should be aligned by checking whether c and c′ meet some conditions.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Here, we illustrate how update rules work by applying a rule named Entity Type on the AMR graph in Figure 1 as an example.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"When determining if the entity type concept country should be aligned to “North Korea”, the Entity

",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Type rule first retrieve that this span is aligned to the fragment (name :op1 ""North"" :op2 ""Korea""), then determine if they are aligned by checking if name is the tail concept of country.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
The greedy search process applies rules in a manually defined order.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The results are mutually exclusive which means once a graph fragment is aligned by one rule, it cannot be realigned.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"By doing so, conflicts between the alignments produced by different rules are resolved.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Flanigan et al. (2014) didn’t talk about the principle of orders but it generally follows the principle that 1) the matching rules have higher priorities than the updating rules, and 2) exact matching rules have higher priorities than the fuzzy matching rules.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Error propagates in the greedy search process.,3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
An alignment error can lead to future errors because of the dependencies and mutual exclusions between rules.,3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"In the JAMR aligner, rules that recall more alignments but introduce errors are carefully opted out and it influences the aligner’s performance.",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
Our motivation is to use rich semantic resources to recall more alignments.,3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"Instead of resolving the resulted conflicts and errors by greedy search, we keep the multiple alignments produced by the aligner and let a parser decide the best alignment.
",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we use two kinds of semantic resources to recall more alignments, which include the similarity drawn from Glove embedding (Pennington et al., 2014)3 and the morphosemantic database (Fellbaum et al., 2009) in the WordNet project4.",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"Two additional matching schemes semantic match and morphological match are proposed as:
Semantic Match.",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
Glove embedding encodes a word into its vector representation.,3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"We define semantic match of a concept as a word in the sentence that has a cosine similarity greater than 0.7 in the embedding space with the concept striping off trailing number (e.g. run-01→ run).

Morphological Match.,3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"Morphosemantic is a database that contains links among derivational

links connecting noun and verb senses (e.g., “example” and exemplify).",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"We define morphological match of a concept as a word in the sentence having the (word, concept) link in the database.
",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"By defining the semantic match and morphological match, we extend the rules in Flanigan et al. (2014) with four additional matching rules as shown in Table 1.",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"These rules are intended to recall the concepts or entities which either semantically resemble a span of words but differ in the surface form, or match a span of words in their morphological derivation.",3.1 Enhancing Aligner with Rich Semantic Resources,[0],[0]
"Using the rules in the JAMR aligner along with our four extended matching rules, we propose an algorithm to draw multiple alignments from a pair of sentence and AMR graph and it is shown in Algorithm 1.",3.2 Producing Multiple Alignments,[0],[0]
"In this algorithm, Ac denotes the set of candidate alignments for a graph fragment c, in which each alignment is represented as a tuple (s, e, c′) where s denotes the starting position, e denotes the ending position, and c′ denotes the concept that lead to this alignment.",3.2 Producing Multiple Alignments,[0],[0]
"At the beginning, Ac is initialized as an empty set (line 1 to 2).",3.2 Producing Multiple Alignments,[0],[0]
Then all the matching rules are tried to align a span of words to that fragment (line 3 to 7).,3.2 Producing Multiple Alignments,[0],[0]
"After applying all the matching rules, all the updating rules are repeatedly applied until no new alignment is generated in one iteration (line 8 to 16).",3.2 Producing Multiple Alignments,[0],[0]
"During applying the updating rules, we keep track of the dependencies between fragments.",3.2 Producing Multiple Alignments,[0],[0]
"Finally, all the possible combination of the alignments are enumerated without considering the one that violates the fragment dependencies (line 17 to 26).",3.2 Producing Multiple Alignments,[0],[0]

A parameterized parser does not accomplish such goal because training its parameters depends on the aligner’s outputs.,4 Transition-based AMR Parser,[0],[0]
A deterministic parser works in this situation but is required to consider the association between concepts and spans.,4 Transition-based AMR Parser,[0],[0]
"This stops the deterministic parsers which build AMR graph only from the derived concepts5 from being used because they do not distinguish alignments that yields to the same set of concepts.6
This discussion shows that to evaluate the quality of an alignment, we need a deterministic (oracle) parser which builds the AMR graph from the raw sentence.",4 Transition-based AMR Parser,[0],[0]
Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) presented a transition-based parser that directly parses a sentence into its AMR graph.,4 Transition-based AMR Parser,[0],[0]

"What’s more, in the non-projective dependency parsing, Choi and McCallum (2013)’s extension to the list-based system (Nivre, 2008) with caching mechanism achieves expected linear time complexity and requires fewer actions to parse a non-projective tree than the swap-based system.",4 Transition-based AMR Parser,[0],[0]

The oracle parser is used for tuning our aligner and training our parser.,4 Transition-based AMR Parser,[0],[0]
We also present a comprehensive comparison of our system with that of Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan (2017) in Section 6.3.,4 Transition-based AMR Parser,[0],[0]
"We follow Choi and McCallum (2013) and define a state in our transition system as a quadruple s = (σ, δ, β,A), where σ is a stack holding processed words, δ is a deque holding words popped out of σ that will be pushed back in the future, and β is a buffer holding unprocessed words.",4.1 List-based Extension for AMR Parsing,[0],[0]
A is a set of labeled relations.,4.1 List-based Extension for AMR Parsing,[0],[0]
A set of actions is defined to parse sentence into AMR graph.,4.1 List-based Extension for AMR Parsing,[0],[0]
Table 2 gives a formal illustration of these actions and how they work.,4.1 List-based Extension for AMR Parsing,[0],[0]
"The first five actions in Table 2 are our ex-
tended actions, and they are used to deriving concepts from the input sentence.",4.1 List-based Extension for AMR Parsing,[0],[0]
"Given an alignment and the gold standard AMR graph, we can build the best AMR graph by repeatedly applying one of these actions and this is what we called oracle parser.",4.2 Oracle Parser,[0],[0]

Action recognition is the task of identifying the action being depicted in a video or still image.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The task is useful for a range of applications such as generating descriptions, image/video retrieval, surveillance, and human–computer interaction.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It has been widely studied in computer vision, often on videos (Nagel, 1994; Forsyth et al., 2005), where motion and temporal information provide cues for recognizing actions (Taylor et al., 2010).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, many actions are recognizable from still images, see the examples in Figure 1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Due to the absence of motion cues and temporal features (Ikizler et al., 2008) action recognition from stills is more challenging.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Most of the existing work can be categorized into four tasks: (a) action classification (AC); (b) determining human–object interaction (HOI); (c) visual verb sense disambiguation (VSD); and (d) visual semantic role labeling (VSRL).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In Figure 2 we illustrate each of these
tasks and show how they are related to each other.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Until recently, action recognition was studied as action classification on small-scale datasets with a limited number of predefined actions labels (Ikizler et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2009; Yao and FeiFei, 2010; Everingham et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2011).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Often the labels in action classification tasks are verb phrases or a combination of verb and object such as playing baseball, riding horse.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These datasets have helped in building models and understanding which aspects of an image are important for classifying actions, but most methods are not scalable to larger numbers of actions (Ramanathan et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Action classification models are trained on images annotated with mutually exclusive labels, i.e., the assumption is that only a single label is relevant for a given image.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This ignores the fact that actions such as holding bicycle and riding bicycle can co-occur in the same image.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To address these issues and also to understand the range of possible interactions between humans and objects, the human–object interaction (HOI) detection task has been proposed, in which all possible interactions between a human and a given object have to be identified (Le et al., 2014; Chao et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, both action classification and HOI detection do not consider the ambiguity that arises when verbs are used as labels, e.g., the verb play has multiple meanings in different contexts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, action labels consisting of verbobject pairs can miss important generalizations:
64
riding horse and riding elephant both instantiate the same verb semantics, i.e., riding animal.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thirdly, existing action labels miss generalizations across verbs, e.g., the fact that fixing bike and repairing bike are semantically equivalent, in spite of the use of different verbs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
These observations have led authors to argue that actions should be analyzed at the level of verb senses.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Gella et al. (2016) propose the new task of visual verb sense disambiguation (VSD), in which a verb– image pair is annotated with a verb sense taken from an existing lexical database (OntoNotes in this case).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While VSD handles distinction between different verb senses, it does not identify or localize the objects that participate in the action denoted by the verb.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent work (Gupta and Malik, 2015; Yatskar et al., 2016) has filled this gap by proposing the task of visual semantic role labeling (VSRL), in which images are labeled with verb frames, and the objects that fill the semantic roles of the frame are identified in the image.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we provide a unified view of action recognition tasks, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We survey existing literature and provide insights into existing datasets and models for action recognition tasks.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We give an overview of commonly used datasets for action recognition tasks in Table 1 and group them according to subtask.,2 Datasets for Action Recognition,[0],[0]
"We observe that the number of verbs covered in these datasets is often smaller than the number of action labels reported (see Table 1, columns #V and #L) and in many cases the action label involves object reference.",2 Datasets for Action Recognition,[0],[0]
"A few of the first action recognition datasets such as the Ikizler and Willow datasets (Ikizler et al.,
2008; Delaitre et al., 2010) had action labels such as throwing and running; they were taken from the sports domain and exhibited diversity in camera view point, background and resolution.",2 Datasets for Action Recognition,[0],[0]
"Then datasets were created to capture variation in human poses in the sports domain for actions such as tennis serve and cricket bowling; typically features based on poses and body parts were used to build models (Gupta et al., 2009).",2 Datasets for Action Recognition,[0],[0]
"Further datasets were created based on the intuition that object information helps in modeling action recognition (Li and Fei-Fei, 2007; Ikizler-Cinbis and Sclaroff, 2010), which resulted in the use of action labels such as riding horse or riding bike (Everingham et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2011).",2 Datasets for Action Recognition,[0],[0]
"Not only were most of these datasets domain specific, but the labels were also manually selected and mutually exclusive, i.e., two actions cannot co-occur in the same image.",2 Datasets for Action Recognition,[0],[0]
"Also, most of these datasets do not localize objects or identify their semantic roles.",2 Datasets for Action Recognition,[0],[0]
"The limitations with early datasets (small scale, domain specificity, and the use of ad-hoc labels that combine verb and object) have been recently addressed in a number of broad-coverage datasets that offer linguistically motivated labels.",2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses,[0],[0]
"Often these datasets use existing linguistic resources such as VerbNet (Schuler, 2005), OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) to classify verbs and their senses.",2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses,[0],[0]
"This allows for a more general, semantically motivated treatment of verbs and verb phrases, and also takes into account that not all verbs are depictable.",2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses,[0],[0]
"For example, abstract verbs such as presuming and acquiring are not depictable at all, while other verbs have both depictable and non-depictable senses: play is non-depictable in playing with emotions, but depictable in playing instrument and playing sport.",2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses,[0],[0]
"The process of identifying depictable verbs or verb senses is used by Ronchi and Perona (2015), Gella et al. (2016) and Yatskar et al. (2016) to identify visual verbs, visual verb senses, and the semantic roles of the participating objects respectively.",2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses,[0],[0]
In all the cases the process of identifying visual verbs or senses is carried out by human annotators via crowd-sourcing platforms.,2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses,[0],[0]
"Visualness labels for 935 OntoNotes verb senses corresponding to 154 verbs is provided by Gella et al. (2016), while Yatskar et al. (2016) provides visualness labels for 9683 FrameNet verbs.",2.1 Identifying Visual Verbs and Verb Senses,[0],[0]
Over the last few years tasks that combine language and vision such as image description and visual question answering have gained much attention.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"This has led to the creation of new, large datasets such as MSCOCO (Chen et al., 2015) and the VQA dataset (Antol et al., 2015).",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"Although these datasets are not created for action recognition, a number of attempts have been made to use the verbs present in image descriptions to annotate actions.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"The COCO-a, VerSe and VCOCO-SRL datasets all use the MSCOCO image descriptions to annotate fine-grained aspects of interaction and semantic roles.
HICO:",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
The HICO dataset has 47.8k images annotated with 600 categories of human-object interactions with 111 verbs applying to 80 object categories of MSCOCO.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
It is annotated to include diverse interactions for objects and has an average of 6.5 distinct interactions per object category.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike other HOI datasets such as TUHOI which label interactions as verbs and ignore senses, the HOI categories of HICO are based on WordNet (Miller, 1995) verb senses.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
The HICO dataset also has multiple annotations per object and it incorporates the information that certain interactions such as riding a bike and holding a bike often co-occur.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"However, it fails to include annotations to distinguish between multiple senses of a verb.
",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"Visual Genome: The dataset created by Krishna et al. (2016) has dense annotations of objects, at-
tributes, and relationships between objects.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
The Visual Genome dataset contains 105k images with 40k unique relationships between objects.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"Unlike other HOI datasets such as HICO, visual genome relationships also include prepositions, comparative and prepositional phrases such as near and taller than, making the visual relationship task more generic than action recognition.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"Krishna et al. (2016) combine all the annotations of objects, relationships, and attributes into directed graphs known as scene graphs.
",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"COCO-a: Ronchi and Perona (2015) present Visual VerbNet (VVN), a list of 140 common visual verbs manually mined from English VerbNet (Schuler, 2005).",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"The coverage of visual verbs in this dataset is not complete, as many visual verbs such as dive, perform and shoot are not included.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
This also highlights a bias in this dataset as the authors relied on occurrence in MSCOCO as a verification step to consider a verb as visual.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"They annotated 10k images containing human subjects with one of the 140 visual verbs, for 80 MSCOCO objects.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"This dataset has better coverage of human-object interactions than the HICO dataset despite of missing many visual verbs.
",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
VerSe: Gella et al. (2016) created a dataset of 3.5k images sampled from the MSCOCO and TUHOI datasets and annotated it with 90 verbs and their OntoNotes senses to distinguish different verb senses using visual context.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"This is the first dataset that aims to annotate all visual senses
of a verb.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"However, the total number of images annotated and number of images for some senses is relatively small, which makes it difficult to use this dataset to train models.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"The authors further divided their 90 verbs into motion and non-motion verbs according to Levin (1993) verb classes and analyzed visual ambiguity in the task of visual sense disambiguation.
",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
VCOCO-SRL: Gupta and Malik (2015) annotated a dataset of 16k person instances in 10k images with 26 verbs and associated objects in the scene with the semantic roles for each action.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
The main aim of the dataset is to build models for visual semantic role labeling in images.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"This task involves identifying the actions depicted in an image, along with the people and objects that instantiate the semantic roles of the actions.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"In the VCOCO-SRL dataset, each person instance is annotated with a mean of 2.8 actions simultaneously.
",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"imSitu: Yatskar et al. (2016) annotated a large dataset of 125k images with 504 verbs, 1.7k semantic roles and 11k objects.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"They used FrameNet verbs, frames and associated objects or scenes with roles to develop the dataset.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
They annotate every image with a single verb and the semantic roles of the objects present in the image.,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
VCOCOSRL,2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"the is dataset most similar to imSitu, however VCOCO-SRL includes localization information of agents and all objects and provides multiple action annotations per image.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, imSitu is the dataset that covers highest number of verbs, while also omitting many commonly studied polysemous verbs such as play.",2.2 Datasets Beyond Action Classification,[0],[0]
"With the exception of a few datasets such as COCO-a, VerSe, imSitu all action recognition datasets have manually picked labels or focus on covering actions in specific domains such as sports.",2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, many datasets only cover actions relevant to specific object categories such as musical instruments, animals and vehicles.",2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
"In the real world, people interact with many more objects and perform actions relevant to a wide range of domains such as personal care, household activities, or socializing.",2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
This limits the diversity and coverage of existing action recognition datasets.,2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
Recently proposed datasets partly handle this issue by using generic linguistic resources to extend the vocabulary of verbs in action labels.,2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
"The diversity issue has also been high-
lighted and addressed in recent video action recognition datasets (Caba Heilbron et al., 2015; Sigurdsson et al., 2016), which include generic household activities.",2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
An analysis of various image description and question answering datasets by Ferraro et al. (2015) shows the bias in the distribution of word categories.,2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
"Image description datasets have a higher distribution of nouns compared to other word categories, indicating that the descriptions are object specific, limiting their usefulness for action-based tasks.",2.3 Diversity in Datasets,[0],[0]
"Template based description generation systems for both videos and images rely on identifying subject–verb–object triples and use language modeling to generate or rank descriptions (Yang et al., 2011; Thomason et al., 2014; Bernardi et al., 2016).",3 Relevant Language and Vision Tasks,[0],[0]
"Understanding actions also plays an important role in question answering, especially when the question is pertaining to an action depicted in the image.",3 Relevant Language and Vision Tasks,[0],[0]
"There are some specifically curated question answering datasets which target human activities or relationships between a pair of objects (Yu et al., 2015).",3 Relevant Language and Vision Tasks,[0],[0]
Mallya and Lazebnik (2016) have shown that systems trained on action recognition datasets could be used to improve the accuracy of visual question answering systems that handle questions related to human activity and human–object relationships.,3 Relevant Language and Vision Tasks,[0],[0]
"Action recognition datasets could be used to learn actions that are visually similar such as interacting with panda and feeding a panda or tickling a baby and calming a baby, which cannot be learned from text alone (Ramanathan et al., 2015).",3 Relevant Language and Vision Tasks,[0],[0]
"Visual semantic role labeling is a crucial step for grounding actions in the physical world (Yang et al., 2016).",3 Relevant Language and Vision Tasks,[0],[0]
"Most of the models proposed for action classification and human–object interaction tasks rely on identifying higher-level visual cues present in the image, including human bodies or body parts (Ikizler et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2011; Andriluka et al., 2014), objects (Gupta et al., 2009), and scenes (Li and Fei-Fei, 2007).",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"Higherlevel visual cues are obtained through low-level features extracted from the image such as Scale Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Spatial Envelopes (Gist) features (Lowe, 1999; Dalal and Triggs,
2005).",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"These are useful in identifying key points, detecting humans, and scene or background information in images, respectively.",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"In addition to identifying humans and objects, the relative position or angle between a human and an object is useful in learning human–object interactions (Le et al., 2014).",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"Most of the existing approaches rely on learning supervised classifiers over low-level features to predict action labels.
",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"More recent approaches are based on end-toend convolutional neural network architectures which learn visual cues such as objects and image features for action recognition (Chao et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016; Mallya and Lazebnik, 2016).",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"While most of the action classification models rely solely on visual information, models proposed for human–object interaction or visual relationship detection sometimes combine human and object identification (using visual features) with linguistic knowledge (Le et al., 2014; Krishna et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2016).",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"Other work on identifying actions, especially methods that focus on relationships that are infrequent or unseen, utilize word vectors learned on large text corpora as an additional source of information (Lu et al., 2016).",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"Similarly, Gella et al. (2016) show that embeddings generated from textual data associated with images (object labels, image descriptions) is useful for visual verb sense disambiguation, and is complementary to visual information.",4 Action Recognition Models,[0],[0]
"Linguistic resources such as WordNet, OntoNotes, and FrameNet play a key role in textual sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The visual action disambiguation and visual semantic role labeling tasks are extensions of their textual counterparts, where context is provided as an image instead of as text.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
Linguistic resources therefore have to play a key role if we are to make rapid progress in these language and vision tasks.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"However, as we have shown in this paper, only a few of the existing datasets for action recognition and related tasks are based on linguistic resources (Chao et al., 2015; Gella et al., 2016; Yatskar et al., 2016).",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This is despite the fact that the WordNet noun hierarchy (for example) has played an important role in recent progress in object recognition, by virtue of underlying the ImageNet database, the de-facto standard for this task (Russakovsky et al., 2015).",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"The success of ImageNet for objects has
in turn helped NLP tasks such as bilingual lexicon induction (Vulić et al., 2016).",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"In our view, language and vision datasets that are based on the WordNet, OntoNotes, or FrameNet verb sense inventories can play a similar role for tasks such as action recognition or visual semantic role labeling, and ultimately be useful also for more distantly related tasks such as language grounding.
",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
Another argument for linking language and vision datasets with linguistic resources is that this enables us to deploy the datasets in a multilingual setting.,5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"For example a polysemous verb such as ride in English has multiple translations in German and Spanish, depending on the context and the objects involved.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Riding a horse is translated as reiten in German and cabalgar in Spanish, whereas riding a bicycle is translated as fahren in German and pedalear in Spanish.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"In contrast, some polysemous verb (e.g., English play) are always translated as the same verb, independent of sense (spielen in German).",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"Such sense mappings are discoverable from multilingual lexical resources (e.g., BabelNet, Navigli and Ponzetto 2010), which makes it possible to construct language and vision models that are applicable to multiple languages.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"This opportunity is lost if language and vision dataset are constructed in isolation, instead of using existing linguistic resources.",5 Discussion,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we have shown the evolution of action recognition datasets and tasks from simple ad-hoc labels to the fine-grained annotation of verb semantics.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"It is encouraging to see the recent increase in datasets that deal with sense ambiguity and annotate semantic roles, while using standard linguistic resources.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"One major remaining issue with existing datasets is their limited coverage, and the skewed distribution of verbs or verb senses.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
Another challenge is the inconsistency in annotation schemes and task definitions across datasets.,6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"For example Chao et al. (2015) used WordNet senses as interaction labels, while Gella et al. (2016) used the more coarsegrained OntoNotes senses.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"Yatskar et al. (2016) used FrameNet frames for semantic role annotation, while Gupta and Malik (2015) used manually curated roles.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"If we are to develop robust, domain independent models, then we need to standardize annotation schemes and use the same linguistic resources across datasets.",6 Conclusions,[0],[0]
"A large amount of recent research has focused on tasks that combine language and vision, resulting in a proliferation of datasets and methods.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"One such task is action recognition, whose applications include image annotation, scene understanding and image retrieval.",abstractText,[0],[0]
"In this survey, we categorize the existing approaches based on how they conceptualize this problem and provide a detailed review of existing datasets, highlighting their diversity as well as advantages and disadvantages.",abstractText,[0],[0]
We focus on recently developed datasets which link visual information with linguistic resources and provide a fine-grained syntactic and semantic analysis of actions in images.,abstractText,[0],[0]

structions has been observed to have a substantial effect on language processing. This begs the question of what causes certain constructions to be more or less frequent. A theory of grounding (Phillips, 2010) would suggest that cognitive limitations might cause languages to develop frequent constructions in such a way as to avoid processing costs. This paper studies how current theories of working memory fit into theories of language processing and what influence memory limitations may have over reading times. Measures of such limitations are evaluated on eye-tracking data and the results are compared with predictions made by different theories of processing.",text,[0],[0]
"Frequency effects in language have been isolated and observed in many studies (Trueswell, 1996; Jurafsky, 1996; Hale, 2001; Demberg and Keller, 2008).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"These effects are important because they illuminate the ontogeny of language (how individual speakers have acquired language), but they do not answer questions about the phylogeny of language (how the language came to its current form).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Phillips (2010) has hypothesized that grammar rule probabilities may be grounded in memory limitations.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Increased delays in processing centerembedded sentences as the number of embeddings increases, for example, are often explained in terms of a complexity cost associated with maintaining incomplete dependencies in working memory (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Other studies have shown a link between processing delays
and the low frequency of center-embedded constructions like object relatives (Hale, 2001), but they have not explored the source of this low frequency.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
A grounding hypothesis would claim that the low probability of generating such a structure may arise from an associated memory load.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this account, while these complexity costs may involve languagespecific concepts such as referent or argument linking, the underlying explanation would be one of memory limitations (Gibson, 2000) or neural activation (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper seeks to explore the different predictions made by these theories on a broad-coverage corpus of eye-tracking data (Kennedy et al., 2003).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In addition, the current experiment seeks to isolate memory effects from frequency effects in the same task.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The results show that memory load measures are a significant factor even when frequency measures are residualized out.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe several frequency and memory measures.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Section 4 describes a probabilistic hierarchic sequence model that allows all of these measures to be directly computed.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Section 5 describes how these measures were used to predict reading time durations on the Dundee eye-tracking corpus.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Sections 6 and 7 present results and discuss.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"One of the strongest predictors of processing complexity is surprisal (Hale, 2001).",2.1 Surprisal,[0],[0]
"It has been shown in numerous studies to have a strong correlation with reading time durations in eye-tracking and selfpaced reading studies when calculated with a variety
95
of models (Levy, 2008; Roark et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010).
",2.1 Surprisal,[0],[0]
"Surprisal predicts the integration difficulty that a word xt at time step t presents given the preceding context and is calculated as follows:
surprisal(xt) =",2.1 Surprisal,[0],[0]

In essence, surprisal measures how unexpected constructions are in a given context.",2.1 Surprisal,[0],[0]
What it does not provide is an explanation for why certain constructions would be less common and thus more surprising.,2.1 Surprisal,[0],[0]
"Processing difficulty can also be measured in terms of entropy (Shannon, 1948).",2.2 Entropy Reduction,[0],[0]
A larger entropy over a random variable corresponds to greater uncertainty over the observed value it will take.,2.2 Entropy Reduction,[0],[0]

This measures the change in uncertainty about the discourse as each new word is processed.",2.2 Entropy Reduction,[0],[0]
"In Dependency Locality Theory (DLT) (Gibson, 2000), complexity arises from intervening referents introduced between a predicate and its argument.",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"Under the original formulation of DLT, there is a
1The parser in this study uses a beam.",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"However, given high parser accuracy, Roark (2001) showed that calculating complexity metrics over a beam should obtain similar results to the full complexity calculation.",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"2The incremental formulation used here was first proposed in Wu et al. (2010).
",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
storage cost for each new referent introduced and an integration cost for each referent intervening in a dependency projection.,3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"This is a simplification made for ease of computation, and subsequent work has found DLT to be more accurate cross-linguistically if the intervening elements are structurally defined rather than defined in terms of referents (Kwon et al., 2010).",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"That is, simply having a particular referent intervene in a dependency projection may not have as great an effect on processing complexity as the syntactic construction the referent appears in.",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"Therefore, this work reinterprets the costs of dependency locality to be related to the events of beginning a center embedding (storage) and completing a center embedding (integration).",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"Note that antilocality effects (where longer dependencies are easier to process) have also been observed in some languages, and DLT is unable to account for these phenomena (Vasishth and Lewis, 2006).",3.1 Dependency Locality,[0],[0]
"Processing complexity has also been attributed to confusability (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005) as defined in domain-general cognitive models like ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004).
",3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
ACT-R is based on theories of neural activation.,3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
Each new word is encoded and stored in working memory until it is retrieved at a later point for modification before being re-encoded into the parse.,3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
"A newly observed sign (word) associatively activates any appropriate arguments from working memory, so multiple similarly appropriate arguments would slow processing as the parser must choose between the highly activated hypotheses.",3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
Any intervening signs (words or phrases) that modify a previously encoded sign re-activate it and raise its resting activation potential.,3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
"This can ease later retrieval of that sign in what is termed an anti-locality effect, contra predictions of DLT.",3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
"In this way, returning out of an embedded clause can actually speed processing by having primed the retrieved sign before it was needed.",3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
ACT-R attributes locality phenomena to frequency effects (e.g. unusual constructions) overriding such priming and to activation decay if embedded signs do not prime the target sign through modification (as in parentheticals).,3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]
"Finally, ACT-R predicts something like DLT’s storage cost due to the need to differentiate each newly encoded sign from

those previously encoded (similarity-based encoding interference) (Lewis et al., 2006).",3.2 ACT-R,[0],[0]

"Hierarchic sequential prediction may be directly applicable to processing syntactic center embeddings (van Schijndel et al., in press).",3.3 Hierarchic Sequential Prediction,[0],[0]
An ongoing parse may be viewed graph-theoretically as one or more connected components of incomplete phrase structure trees (see Figure 1).,3.3 Hierarchic Sequential Prediction,[0],[0]
"Beginning a new subordinate sequence (a center embedding) introduces a new connected component, disjoint from that of the superordinate sequence.",3.3 Hierarchic Sequential Prediction,[0],[0]
"As the subordinate sequence proceeds, the new component gains associated discourse referents, each sequentially cued from the last, until finally it merges with the superordinate connected component at the end of the embedded clause, forming a single connected component representing the parse up to that point.",3.3 Hierarchic Sequential Prediction,[0],[0]
"Since it is not connected to the subordinate connected component prior to merging, the superordinate connected component must be recalled through temporal cueing.

"McElree (2001; 2006) has found that retrieval of any non-focused (or in this case, unconnected) element from memory leads to slower processing.",3.3 Hierarchic Sequential Prediction,[0],[0]
"Therefore, integrating two disjoint connected components should be expected to incur a processing cost due to the need to recall the current state of the superordinate sequence to continue the parse.",3.3 Hierarchic Sequential Prediction,[0],[0]
Such a cost would corroborate a DLT-like theory where integration slows processing.,3.3 Hierarchic Sequential Prediction,[0],[0]
Language processing is typically centered in the left hemisphere of the brain (for right-handed individuals).,3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]
Just and Varma (2007) provide fMRI results suggesting readers dynamically recruit additional processing resources such as the right-side homologues of the language processing areas of the brain when processing center-embedded constructions.,3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]
"Once an embedded construction terminates, the reader may still have temporary access to these extra processing resources, which may briefly speed processing.
",3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]
"This hypothesis would, therefore, predict an encoding cost when a center embedding is initiated.",3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]
"The resulting inhibition would trigger recruitment of additional processing resources, which would then
allow the rest of the embedded structure to be processed at the usual speed.",3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]
"Upon completing an embedding, the difficulty arising from memory retrieval (McElree, 2001) would be ameliorated by these extra processing resources, and the reduced processing complexity arising from reduced memory load would yield a temporary facilitation in processing.",3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]
"No longer requiring the additional resources to cope with the increased embedding, the processor would release them, returning the processor to its usual speed.",3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]
"Unlike anti-locality, where processing is facilitated in longer passages due to accumulating probabilistic evidence, a model of dynamic recruitment of additional processing resources would predict universal facilitation after a center embedding of any length, modulo frequency effects.",3.4 Dynamic Recruitment of Additional Processing Resources,[0],[0]

"This paper uses a hierarchic sequence model implementation of a left-corner parser variant (van Schijndel et al., in press), which represents connected components of phrase structure trees in hierarchies of hidden random variables.",4 Model,[0],[0]

An example parse is shown in Figure 2.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"Since two binary structural decisions (F and L) must be made in order to generate each word, there are four possible structures that may be generated (see Table 1).",4 Model,[0],[0]
The F+L– transition initiates a new level of embedding at word xt and so requires the superordinate state to be encoded for later retrieval (e.g. on observing the in Figure 2).,4 Model,[0],[0]

subordinate connected component state will be integrated.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"For example, in Figure 2, upon observing ’s, the parser must use temporal cueing to recall that it is in the middle of processing an NP (to complete an S), which sequentially cues a prediction of N. F–L– transitions complete the awaited sign of the most subordinate state and so sequentially cue a following connected component state at the same tier of the hierarchy.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"For example, in Figure 2, after observing studio, the parser uses the completed NP to sequentially cue the prediction that it has finished the left child of an S. F+L+ transitions locally expand the awaited sign of the most subordinate state and so should also not require any recall or encoding.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"For example, in Figure 2, observing bought while awaiting a VP sequentially cues a prediction of NP.
F+L–, then, loosely corresponds to a storage action under DLT as more hierarchic levels must now be maintained at each future step of the parse.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"As stated before, it differs from DLT in that it is sensitive to the depth of embedding rather than a particular subset of syntactic categories.",4 Model,[0],[0]
Wu et al. (2010) found that increasing the embedding depth led to longer reading times in a self-paced reading experiment.,4 Model,[0],[0]
"In ACT-R terms, F+L– corresponds to an encoding action, potentially causing processing difficulty resulting from the similarity of the current sign to previously encoded signs.
",4 Model,[0],[0]
"F–L+, by contrast, is similar to DLT’s integration action since a subordinate connected component is integrated into the rest of the parse structure.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"This represents a temporal cueing event in which the awaited category of the superordinate connected
component is recalled.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"In contrast to DLT, embedding difference and dynamic recruitment would predict a shorter reading time in the F–L+ case because of the reduction in memory load.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"In an ACT-R framework, reading time durations can increase at the retrieval site because the retrieval causes competition among similarly encoded signs in the context set.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"While it is possible for reading times to decrease when completing a center embedding in ACT-R (Vasishth and Lewis, 2006), this would be expressed as a frequency effect due to certain argument types commonly foreshadowing their predicates (Jaeger et al., 2008).",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Since frequency effects are factored separately from memory effects in this study, ACT-R would predict longer residual (memory-based) reading times when completing an embedding.

and L transitions are summarized in Table 2.",4 Model,[0],[0]
"Eye-tracking and reading time data are often used to test complexity measures (Gibson, 2000; Demberg and Keller, 2008; Roark et al., 2009) under the assumption that readers slow down when reading more complex passages.",5 Eye-tracking,[0],[0]
"Readers saccade over portions of text and regress back to preceding text in complex patterns, but studies have correlated certain measures with certain processing constraints (see Clifton et al. 2007 for a review).",5 Eye-tracking,[0],[0]
"For example, the initial length of time fixated on a single word is correlated with word identification time; whereas regression durations after a word is fixated (but prior to a fixation in a new region) are hypothesized to correlate
with integration difficulty.
",5 Eye-tracking,[0],[0]
"Since this work focuses on incremental processing, all processing that occurs up to a given point in the sentence is of interest.",5 Eye-tracking,[0],[0]
"Therefore, in this study, predictions will be compared to go-past durations.",5 Eye-tracking,[0],[0]
"Go-past durations are calculated by summing all fixations in a region of text, including regressions, until a new region is fixated, which accounts for additional processing that may take place after initial lexical access, but before the next region is processed.",5 Eye-tracking,[0],[0]
"For example, if one region ends at word 5 in a sentence, and the next fixation lands on word 8, then the go-past region consists of words 6-8 and the go-past duration sums all fixations until a fixation occurs after word 8.",5 Eye-tracking,[0],[0]
"The measures presented in this paper were evaluated on the Dundee eye-tracking corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The corpus consists of 2388 sentences of naturally occurring news text written in standard British English.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The corpus also includes eye-tracking data from 10 native English speakers, which provides a test corpus of 260,124 subject-duration pairs of reading time data.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Of this, any fixated words appearing fewer than 5 times in the training data were considered unknown and were filtered out to obtain accurate predictions.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Fixations on the first or last words of a line were also filtered out to avoid any ‘wrap-up’ effects resulting from preparing to saccade to the beginning of the next line or resulting from orienting to a new line.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Additionally, following Demberg and Keller (2008), any fixations that skip more than 4 words were attributed to track loss by the eyetracker or lack of attention of the reader and so were excluded from the analysis.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This left the final evaluation corpus with 151,331 subject-duration pairs.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The evaluation consisted of fitting a linear mixedeffects model (Baayen et al., 2008) to reading time durations using the lmer function of the lme4 R package (Bates et al., 2011; R Development Core Team, 2010).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]

Included among the fixed effects were the position in the sentence that initiated the go-past region (SENTPOS) and the number of characters in the initiating word (NRCHAR).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"The difficulty of integrating a word may be seen in whether the immediately following word was fixated (NEXTISFIX), and similarly if the immediately previous word was fixated (PREVISFIX)",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
the current word probably need not be fixated for as long.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Finally, unigram (LOGPROB) and bigram probabilities are included.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The bigram probabilities are those of the current word given the previous word (LOGFWPROB) and the current word given the following word (LOGBWPROB).,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Fossum and Levy (2012) showed that for n-gram probabilities to be effective predictors on the Dundee corpus, they must be calculated from a wide variety of texts, so following them, this study used the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979), the WSJ Sections 02-21 (Marcus et al., 1993), the written text portion of the British National Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2007), and the Dundee corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
This amounted to an n-gram training corpus of roughly 87 million words.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"These statistics were smoothed using the SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) implementation of modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]

"The preceding measures are commonly used in baseline models to fit reading time data (Demberg and Keller, 2008; Frank and Bod, 2011; Fossum and Levy, 2012) and were calculated from the final word of each go-past region.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The following measures create a more sophisticated baseline by accumulating over the entire go-past region to capture what must be integrated into the discourse to continue the parse.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]

"7In particular, these models assume the noise in the data is normally distributed.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Initial exploratory trials showed that the residuals of fitting any sensible baseline also become more normally distributed if the response variable is log-transformed.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Finally, the directions of the effects remain the same whether or not the reading times are log-transformed, though significance cannot be ascertained without the transform.

"tive total surprisal (CUMUSURP) and cumulative entropy reduction (ENTRED) give the surprisal (Hale, 2001) and entropy reduction (Hale, 2003) summed over the go-past region.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"To avoid convergence issues, each of the cumulative measures is residualized from the next simpler model in the following order: CWDELTA from the standard baseline, CUMUSURP from the baseline with CWDELTA, and ENTRED from the baseline with all other effects.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Residualization was accomplished by using the simpler mixed-effects model to fit the measure of interest.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The residuals from that model fit were then used in place of the factor of interest.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
All joint interactions were included in the baseline model as well.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Finally, to account for spillover effects (Just et al., 1982) where processing from a previous region contributes to the following duration, the above baseline predictors from the previous go-past region were included as factors for the current region.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Having SURP as a predictor with CUMUSURP may seem redundant, but initial analyses showed SURP was a significant predictor over CUMUSURP when CWDELTA was a separate factor in the baseline (current: p = 2.2 · 10−16 spillover: p = 2 · 10−15) and vice versa (current: p = 2.2 · 10−16 spillover: p = 6 · 10−5).",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
One reason for this could be that go-past durations conflate complexity experienced when initially fixating on a region with the difficulty experienced during regressions.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"By including both versions of surprisal, the model is able to account for frequency effects occurring in both conditions.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This study is only interested in how well the proposed memory-based measures fit the data over the baseline, so to avoid fitting to the test data or weakening the baseline by overfitting to training data, the full baseline was used in the final evaluation.
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Each measure proposed in this paper was summed over go-past regions to make it cumulative and was residualized from all non-spillover factors before being included on top of the full baseline as a main effect.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Likewise, the spillover version of each proposed measure was residualized from the other spillover factors before being included as a main effect.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
Only a single proposed measure (or its spillover corrollary) was included in each model.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The results shown in Table 3 reflect the probability of the full model fit being obtained by the model lacking each factor of interest.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"This was found via posterior sam-
pling of each factor using the Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of the languageR R package (Baayen, 2008).
",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The results indicate that the F+L– and F–L+ measures were both significant predictors of duration as expected.,6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
"Further, F–L– and F+L+, which both simply reflect sequential cueing, were not significant predictors of go-past duration, also as expected.",6 Evaluation,[0],[0]
The fact that F+L– was strongly predictive over the baseline is encouraging as it suggests that memory limitations could provide at least a partial explanation of why certain constructions are less frequent in corpora and thus yield a high surprisal.,7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Moreover, it indicates that the model corroborates the shared prediction of most of the memory-based models that initiating a new connected component slows processing.
",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The fact that F–L+ is predictive but has a negative coefficient could be evidence of anti-locality, or it could be an indication of some sort of processing momentum due to dynamic recruitment of additional processing resources (Just and Varma, 2007).",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Since anti-locality is an expectation-based frequency effect, and since this study controlled for frequency effects with n-grams, surprisal, and entropy reduction, an anti-locality explanation would rely on either (i) more precise variants of the metrics used in this study or (ii) other frequency metrics altogether.",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Future work could investigate the possibility of anti-locality by looking at the distance between an encoding operation and its corresponding
integration action to see if the integration facilitation observed in this study is driven by longer embeddings or if there is simply a general facilitation effect when completing embeddings.
",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"The finding of a negative integration cost was previously observed by Wu et al. (2010) as well as Demberg and Keller (2008), although Demberg and Keller calculated it using the original referent-based definitions of Gibson (1998; 2000) and varied which parts of speech counted for calculating integration cost.",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Ultimately, Demberg and Keller (2008) concluded that the negative coefficient was evidence that integration cost was not a good broad-coverage predictor of reading times; however, this study has replicated the effect and showed it to be a very strong predictor of reading times, albeit one that is correlated with facilitation rather than inhibition.
",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"It is interesting that many studies have found negative integration cost using naturalistic stimuli while others have consistently found positive integration cost when using constructed stimuli with multiple center embeddings presented without context (Gibson, 2000; Chen et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2010).",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
It may be the case that any dynamic recruitment is overwhelmed by the memory demands of multiply center-embedded stimuli.,7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Alternatively, it may be that the difficulty of processing multiply center-embedded sentences containing ambiguities produces anxiety in subjects, which slows processing at implicit prosodic boundaries (Fodor, 2002; Mitchell et al., 2008).",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In any case, the source of this discrepancy presents an attractive target for future research.
",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"In general, sequential prediction does not seem to present people with any special ease or difficulty as evidenced by the lack of significance of F–L– and F+L+ predictions when frequency effects are factored out.",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This supports a theory of sequential, content-based cueing (Botvinick, 2007) that predicts that certain states would directly cue other states and thus avoid recall difficulty.",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
An example of this may be seen in the case of a transitive verb triggering the prediction of a direct object.,7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"This kind of cueing would show up as a frequency effect predicted by surprisal rather than as a memory-based cost, due to frequent occurrences becoming ingrained as a learned skill.",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Future work could use these sequential cueing operations to investigate further claims
of the dynamic recruitment hypothesis.",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"One of the implications of the hypothesis is that recruitment of resources alleviates the initial encoding cost, which allows the parser to continue on as before the embedding.",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"DLT, on the other hand, predicts that there is a storage cost for maintaining unresolved dependencies during a parse (Gibson, 2000).",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"By weighting each of the sequential cueing operations with the embedding depth at which it occurs, an experiment may be able to test these two predictions.
",7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
This study has shown that measures based on working memory operations have strong predictivity over other previously proposed measures including those associated with frequency effects.,7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
This suggests that memory limitations may provide a partial explanation of what gives rise to frequency effects.,7 Discussion and Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Lastly, this paper provides evidence that there is a robust facilitation effect in English that arises from completing center embeddings.

We try to answer the following research questions by comparing the syntactic model and the Ngram model using the same search algorithm.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
• What is the influence of automaticallyparsed training data on the performance of syntactic models.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Because manual syntactic annotations are relatively limited and highly expensive, it is necessary to use large-scale automatically-parsed sentences for training syntactic language models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a result, the syntactic structures that a word ordering system learns can be inaccurate.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, this might not affect
369
the quality of the synthesized output, which is a string only.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We quantitatively study the influence of parsing accuracy of syntactic training data on word ordering output.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
• What is the influence of data scale on the performance.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
N-gram language models can be trained efficiently over large numbers of raw sentences.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, syntactic language models can be much slower to train due to rich features.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We compare the output quality of the two models on different scales of training data, and also on different amounts of training time.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
•What are the errors characteristics of each model.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Syntactic language models can potentially be better in capturing larger constituents and overall sentence structures.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, compared with N-gram models, little work has been done to quantify the difference between the two models.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We characterise the outputs using a set of different measures, and show empirically the relative strength and weakness of each model.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
• What is the effect of model combination.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Finally, because the two models make different types of errors, they can be combined to give better outputs.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We develop a combined model by discretizing probability from N-gram model, and using them as features in the syntactic model.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The combined model gives the best results in a standard benchmark.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Syntactic word ordering algorithms take a multiset of input words constructing an output sentence and its syntactic derivation simultaneously.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"Transition-based syntactic word ordering can be modelled as an extension to transition-based parsing (Liu et al., 2015), with the main difference be-
ing that the order of words is not given in the input, which leads to a much larger search space.
",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"We take the system of Liu, et al.1, which gives state-of-the-art performance and efficiencies in standard word ordering benchmark.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"It maintains outputs in stack σ, and orders the unprocessed incoming words in a set ρ.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"Given an input bag of words, ρ is initialized to the input and σ is initialized as empty.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"The system repeatedly applies transition actions to consume words from ρ and construct output on σ.
",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"Figure 1 shows the deduction system, where ρ is unordered and any word in ρ can be shifted onto the stack σ.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"The set of actions are SHIFT, L-ARC and R-ARC.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
The SHIFT actions add a word to the stack.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"For the L-ARC and R-ARC actions, new arcs {j ← i} and {j → i} are constructed respectively.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"Under these possible actions, the unordered word set “potatoes0 Tom1 likes2” is generated as shown in Figure 2, and the result is “Tom1 ←likes2→potatoes0”.
",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
We apply the learning and search framework of Zhang and Clark (2011a).,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
Pseudocode of the search algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"[] refers to an empty stack, and set(1...n) represents the full set of input words W and n is the number of distinct words.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"candidates stores possible states, and agenda stores temporary states transited from possible actions.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
GETACTIONS generates a set of possible actions depending on the current state s. APPLY generates a new state by applying action on the current state s. N-BEST produces the top k candidates in agenda.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"Finally, the algorithm returns the highest-score state best in the agenda.
",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
A global linear model is used to score search hypotheses.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"Given a hypothesis h, its score is calculated by:
Score(h) = Φ(h) · ~θ, 1http://sourceforge.net/projects/zgen/
Algorithm 1 Transition-based linearisation Input: W, a set of input word Output: the highest-scored final state 1: candidates← ([], set(1..n),Ø) 2: agenda← Ø 3: N ← 2n 4: for i← 1..N do 5: for s in candidates do 6: for action in GETACTIONS(s) do 7: agenda← APPLY(s, action) 8: end for 9: end for 10: candidates← N-BEST(agenda) 11:",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"agenda← Ø 12: end for 13: best← BEST(candidates) 14: return best
where Φ(h) is the feature vector of h, extracted by using the same feature templates as Liu et al.(2015), which are shown in Table 1 and ~θ is the parameter vector of the model.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
The feature templates essentially represents a syntactic language model.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 2, from the hypotheses produced in steps 2 and 4, the features “Tom1 ← likes2” and “likes2 → potatoes0” are extracted, which corresponds to P (Tom1|likes2) and P (potatoes0|likes2) respectively in the dependency language model of Chen et al.,(2012).",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
Training.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"We apply perceptron with early-update (Collins and Roark, 2004), and iteratively tune related parameters on a set of development data.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"For each iteration, we measure the performance on the development data, and choose best parameters for final tests.
2.2 N-gram word ordering
We build an N-gram word ordering system under the same beam-search framework as the syntactic word ordering system.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"In particular, search is performed incrementally, from left to right, adding one word at each step.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"The decoding process can be regarded as a simplified version of Algorithm 1, with only SHIFT being returned by GETACTIONS, and the score of each transition is given by a standard N-gram language model.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
We use the same beam size for both N-gram and the syntactic word ordering.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"Compared with the syntactic model, the N-gram model has less information for disambiguation, but also has less structural ambiguities, and therefore a smaller search space.
",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
Training.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
We train N-gram language models from raw text using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing without pruning.,2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"The text is true-case tokenized, and we train 4-gram language modes using KenLM2, which gives high efficiencies in standard N-gram language model construction.",2.1 Syntactic word ordering,[0],[0]
"For training data, we use the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) sections 1-22 of the Penn Treebank (Mar-
2https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/
cus et al., 1993), and the Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Xinhua News Agency (XIN) subsets of the English Giga Word Fifth Edition (Parker et al., 2011).",3.1 Data,[0],[0]
"As the development data, we use WSJ section 0 for parameter tuning.",3.1 Data,[0],[0]
"For testing, we use data from various domain, which consist of WSJ section 23, Washington Post/Bloomberg(WPB) subsets of the English Giga Word Fifth Edition and SANCL blog data, as shown in Table 2.",3.1 Data,[0],[0]
Example sentence in various test domains are shown in Table 3.,3.1 Data,[0],[0]
"We follow previous work and use the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) for evaluation.",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"Since BLEU only scores N-gram precisions, it can be in favour of N-gram language models.",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"We additionally use METEOR3(Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) to evaluate the system performances.",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
The BLEU metric measures the fluency of generated sentence without considering long range ordering.,3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
The METEOR metric can potentially fix this problem using a set of mapping between generated sentences and references to evaluate distortion.,3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"The following example illustrates the difference between BLEU and METEOR on long range reordering, where the reference is
(1)",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"[The document is necessary for developer ,]0",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
[so you can not follow this document to get right options .]1,3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"and the generated output sentence is
(2)",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
[so you can not follow this document to get right options .]1,3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"[The document is necessary for developer ,]0 .",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
There is a big distortion in the output.,3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"The BLEU metric gives a score of 90.09 out of 100, while
3http://www.cs.cmu.edu/∼alavie/METEOR/
the METEOR gives a score of 61.34 out of 100.",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
This is because that METEOR is based on explicit word-to-word matches over the whole sentence.,3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"For word ordering, word-to-word matches are unique, which facilitates METEOR evaluation between generated sentences and references.",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"As can bee seen from the example, long range distortion can highly influence the METEOR scores making the METEOR metric more suitable for evaluating word ordering distortions.",3.2 Evaluation metrics,[0],[0]
"For all the experiments, we assume that the input is a bag of words without order, and the output is a fully ordered sentence.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"Following previous work (Wan et al., 2009; Zhang, 2013; Liu et al., 2015), we treat base noun phrases (i.e. noun phrases do not contains other noun phrases, such as ‘Pierre Vinken’ and ‘a big cat’) as a single word.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"This avoids unnecessary ambiguities in combination between their subcomponents.
",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
The syntactic model requires that the training sentences have syntactic dependency structure.,3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"However, only the WSJ data contains goldstandard annotations.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"In order to obtain automatically annotated dependency trees, we train a constituent parser using the gold-standard bracketed sentences from WSJ, and automatically parse the Giga Word data.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"The results are turned into dependency trees using Penn2Malt4, after base noun phrases are extracted.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"In our experiments, we use ZPar5 (Zhu et al., 2013) for automatic constituent parsing.
",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"In order to study the influence of parsing accuracy of the training data, we also use ten-fold jackknifing to construct WSJ training data with different accuracies.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"The data is randomly split into ten equal-size subsets, and each subset is automatically parsed with a parser trained on the other

nine subset.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
"In order to obtain datasets with different parsing accuracies, we randomly sample a small number of sentences from each training subset, as shown in Table 4.",3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
The dependency trees of each set are derived from these bracketed sentences using Penn2Malt after base noun phrase are extracted as a single word.,3.3 Data preparation,[0],[0]
We train the syntactic models on the WSJ training parsing data with different accuracies.,4.1 In-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"The WSJ development data are used to find out the optimal number of training iterations for each experiments, and the WSJ test results are shown in Table 5.
",4.1 In-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
Table 5 shows that the parsing accuracy can affect the performance of the syntactic model.,4.1 In-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
A higher parsing accuracy can lead to a better syntactic language model.,4.1 In-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
It conforms to the intuition that syntactic quality affects the fluency of surface texts.,4.1 In-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, the influence is not huge, the BLEU scores decrease by 1.0 points as the parsing accuracy decreases from 88.10% to 57.31%",4.1 In-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"The influence of parsing accuracy of the training data on cross-domain word ordering is measured by using the same training settings, but testing on the WPB and SANCL test sets.",4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
Table 5 shows that the performance on cross-domain word ordering cannot reach that of in-domain word ordering using the syntactic models.,4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"Compared with the cross-domain experiments, the influence of parsing accuracy becomes smaller.",4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"In the WPB test, the fluctuation of performance decline to about 0.9 BLEU points, and in the SANCL test, the fluctuation is about 1.1 BLEU points.
",4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"In conclusion, the experiments show that pars-
ing accuracies have a relatively small influence on the syntactic models.",4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
This suggests that it is possible to use large automatically-parsed data to train syntactic models.,4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, when the training data scale increases, syntactic models can become much slower to train compared with Ngram models.",4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
"The influence on data scale, which includes output quality and training time, is further studied in the next section.",4.2 Cross-domain word ordering,[0],[0]
We use the AFP news data as the training data for the experiments of this section.,5 Influence of data scale,[0],[0]
"The syntactic models are trained using automatically-parsed trees derived from ZPar, as described in Section 3.3.",5 Influence of data scale,[0],[0]
"The WPB test data is used to measure indomain performance, and the SANCL blog data is used to measure cross-domain performance.",5 Influence of data scale,[0],[0]
"The Figure 3 and 4 shows that using both the BLEU and the METEOR metrics, the performance of the syntactic model is better than that of the N-gram models.",5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
It suggests that sentences generated by the syntactic model have both better fluency and better ordering.,5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
"The performance of the syntactic models is not highly weakened in cross-domain tests.
",5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
"The grey dot in each figure shows the performance of the syntactic model trained on the gold WSJ training data, and evaluated on the same WPB and SANCL test data sets.",5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
A comparison between the grey dots and the dashed lines shows that the syntactic model trained on the WSJ data perform better than the syntactic model trained on similar amounts of AFP data.,5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
"This again shows the effect of syntactic quality of the training data.
",5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, as the scale of automaticallyparsed AFP data increases, the performance of the
syntactic model rapidly increases, surpassing the syntactic model trained on the high-quality WSJ data.",5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
"This observation is important, showing that large-scale data can be used to alleviate the problem of lower syntactic quality in automaticallyparsed data, which can be leveraged to address the scarcity issue of manually annotated data in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.",5.1 Influence on BLEU and METEOR,[0],[0]
The training time of both syntactic models and N-gram models increases as the size of training data increases.,5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
Figure 5 shows the BLEU of the two systems under different amounts of training time.,5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
"There is no result reported for the syntactic model beyond 1 million training sentences, because training becomes infeasibly slow 6.",5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]

"If the training time is over 90 hours for a model, we consider it infeasible.
other hand, the N-gram model can be trained using all the WSJ, AFP, XIN training sentences, which are 53 millions, within 103.2 seconds.",5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
"As a result, there is no overlap between the syntactic model and the N-gram model curves.
",5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
"As can be seen from the figure, the syntactic model is much slower to train.",5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
"However, it benefits more from the scale of the training data, with the slope of the dashed curve being steeper than that of the solid curve.",5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
The N-gram model can be trained with more data thanks to the fast training speed.,5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
"However, the performance of the Ngram model flattens when the training data size reaches beyond 3 million.",5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
Projection of the solid curve suggests that the performance of the N-gram model may not surpass that of the syntactic model even if sufficiently large data is available for training the N-gram model in more time.,5.2 Influence on training time,[0],[0]
"Although giving overall better performance, the syntactic model does not perform better than the N-gram model in all cases.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"Here we analyze the strength of each model via more fine-grained comparison.
",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"In this set of experiments, the syntactic model is trained using gold-standard annotated WSJ training parse trees, and the N-gram model is trained using the data containing WSJ training data, AFP and XIN.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
"The WSJ test data, which contains
golden constituent trees, is used to analyze errors in different aspects.",6 Error analysis,[0],[0]
The BLEU and METEOR scores of the two systems on various sentence lengths are shown in Figure 6.,6.1 Sentence length,[0],[0]
"The results are measured by binning sentences according to their lengths, so that each bin contains about the same number of sentences.",6.1 Sentence length,[0],[0]
"As shown by the figure, the N-gram model performs better on short sentences (less than 8 tokens), and the syntactic model performs better on longer sentences.",6.1 Sentence length,[0],[0]
"This can be explained by the fact that longer sentences have richer underlying syntactic structures, which can better captured by the syntactic model.",6.1 Sentence length,[0],[0]
"In contrast, for shorter sentences, the syntactic structure is relatively simple, and therefore the N-gram model can give better performance based on string patterns, which form smaller search spaces.",6.1 Sentence length,[0],[0]
"We measure the average distortion rate of output word w using the following metric:
distortion(w) = |iw",6.2 Distortion range,[0],[0]
"− i′w| len(Sw) ,
where iw is index of wordw in the output sentence Sw, i′w is the index of the word w in the reference sentence.",6.2 Distortion range,[0],[0]
"len(Sw) is the number of tokens in
sentence Sw.",6.2 Distortion range,[0],[0]
Figure 7 shows distributions of distortion respectively by the syntactic and N-gram model.,6.2 Distortion range,[0],[0]
"The N-gram model makes relatively fewer short-range distortions, but more long-range distortions.",6.2 Distortion range,[0],[0]
This can be explained by the local scoring nature of the N-gram model.,6.2 Distortion range,[0],[0]
"In contrast, the syntactic model makes less long-range distortions, which can suggest better sentence structure.",6.2 Distortion range,[0],[0]
"We further evaluate sentence structure correctness by evaluating the recalls of discovered constituent span in output two systems, respectively.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
As shown in Figure 8.,6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
The syntactic model performs better in most constituent labels.,6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"However, the N-gram model performs better in WHPP, SBARQ and WHNP.
",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"In the test data, WHPP, SBARQ and WHNP are much less than PP, NP, VP, ADJP, ADVP and CONJP, on which the syntactic model gives better recalls.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
WHNP spans are small and most of them consist of a question word (WP$) and one or two nouns (e.g. “whose (WP$) parents (NNS)”).,6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
WHPP spans are also small and usually consist of a preposition (IN) and a WHNP span (e.g “at (IN) what level (WHNP)”).,6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
The N-gram model performs better on these small spans.,6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"The syntactic model also performs better on S, which covers the whole sentence structure.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"This verifies the hypothesis introduce that syntactic language models better capture overall sentential grammaticality.
7",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"Combining the syntactic and N-gram models
The results above show the respective error characteristics of each model, which are complimentary.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"This suggests that better results can be achieved by model combination.
7.1 N-gram language model feature
We integrate the two types of models by using N-gram language model probabilities as features in the syntactic model.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"N-gram language model probabilities, which ranges from 0 to 1.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"Direct use of real value probabilities as features does not work well in our experiments, and we use discretized features instead.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"For the L-ARC and RARC actions, because no words are pushed onto the stack, The NLM feature is set to NULL by default.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"For the SHIFT action, different feature values are extracted depending on the NLM from 0 to 1.
",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"In order to measure the N-gram probabilities on our data, we train the 4-gram language model WSJ, AFP and XIN data, and randomly sample 4- gram probabilities from the syntactic model output on the WSJ development data, finding that most of 4-gram probabilities p are larger than 10−12.5.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"In this way, if p lower than 10−12.5, NLM feature value is set to LOW.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"As for p larger than 10−12.5, we extract the discrete features by assigning them into different bins.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
We bin the 4-gram probabilities with different granularities without overlap features.,6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"As shown in Table 6, NLM-20, NLM10, NLM-5 and NLM-2 respectively use 20, 10, 5
and 2 bins to capture NLM feature values.",6.3 Constituent span,[0],[0]
"We use the WSJ, AFP and XIN for training the Ngram model7.",7.2 Final results,[0],[0]
"The same WSJ, WPB and SANCL test data are used to measure performances on different domains.
",7.2 Final results,[0],[0]
The experimental results are shown in Tables 7 and 8.,7.2 Final results,[0],[0]

"A subtle but crucial aspect is that humans are aware that machines do not have feelings or experiences of their own, so any attempt at self-disclosure on the part of the machine is inherently disingenuous.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, Nass et al. (1994) suggests that humans tend to view computers as social actors, and interact with them in much the same way they do with humans.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Disclosure reciprocity in such a setting would have far-reaching implications for dialog systems which aim to elicit information from the user in order to offer more personalized experiences for example, or to better achieve task completion (Bickmore and Cassell, 2001; Bickmore and Picard, 2005; Goldstein and Benassi, 1994; Lee and Choi, 2017).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we study this phenomena by building an open-domain chatbot (§3) which engages in social conversation with hundreds of Amazon Alexa users (Figure 1.), and gains insights into two aspects of human-machine self-disclosure.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"First, self-disclosure by the dialog agent is strongly correlated with instances of self-disclosure by the user indicating disclosure reciprocity in interactions with spoken dialog systems (§4.1).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Second, initial self-disclosure by the user can characterize user behavior throughout the conversation (§4.2).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We additionally study the effect of self-disclosure and likability, but find no reliable linear relationship with the amount of self-disclosure in the conversation (§4.3).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first large-scale study of reciprocity and self-disclosure between users in the real world and spoken dialog systems.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Self-disclosure as a social phenomena is the act of revealing information about oneself to others.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"It has been of particular interest to study what factors makes humans self-disclose (Miller et al., 1983; Dindia and Allen, 1992; Hill and Stull, 1987; Buhrmester and Prager, 1995; Stokes, 1987; Qian and Scott, 2007; Jourard and Friedman, 1970; Ko and Kuo, 2009), how do they do it (Chen, 1995;
Greene et al., 2006; Chelune, 1975; Sprecher and Hendrick, 2004) and what are the effects of selfdisclosing (Gibbs et al., 2006; Mazer et al., 2009; Forest and Wood, 2012; Turner et al., 2007; Knox et al., 1997; Vittengl and Holt, 2000).
",2 Background,[0],[0]
"One such effect is disclosure reciprocity, which has been shown to be one of the most significant effects of self-disclosure (Jourard, 1971).",2 Background,[0],[0]
Reciprocity is the phenomenon by which selfdisclosure by one participant in a dyadic social interaction results in self-disclosure from the other participant in response.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"A substantial amount of research has shown that when one party selfdiscloses, the other party is much more likely to self-disclose (Jourard, 1971; Jourard and Friedman, 1970; Dindia et al., 2002; Derlega et al., 1973).",2 Background,[0],[0]
"While the exact cause of this phenomena is not known, it has been suggested that selfdisclosure can be viewed as a social exchange, where the party receiving self-disclosure feels obligated to self-disclose in return (Archer, 1979), or as a social conversational norm (Derlega et al., 1993), or from the point of view of social trustattraction (Vittengl and Holt, 2000) where people self-disclose to people who disclose to them, as they consider self-disclosure to be a sign of trust and liking.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Additionally, Sprecher and Hendrick (2004) find that people who consider themselves to be high self-disclosers are likely to be much better at eliciting self-disclosure as well.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Derlega et al. (1973) observe that self-disclosure is a positive function of self-disclosure received, regardless of liking for the initial discloser.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"Mikulincer and Nachshon (1991) analyze personality types and self-disclosure, and find that secure people are more likely to both self-disclose and reciprocate self-disclosure.",2 Background,[0],[0]
Cozby (1972) study the relationship between disclosure and liking and suggest that this relationship is not linear.,2 Background,[0],[0]
"In this work, we attempt to combine these perspectives to gain insights into the nature of self-disclosure in humanmachine dialog.",2 Background,[0],[0]
"In this work, we consider the definition of selfdisclosure within the theoretical framework of social penetration theory (Altman and Taylor, 1973) where it is defined to be the voluntary sharing of information which could include amongst other things one’s personal history, thoughts, opinions,
beliefs, feelings, preferences, attitudes, aspirations, likes, dislikes and favorites.",3.1 Coding Self Disclosure,[0],[0]
"In a humanmachine context, we define self-disclosure as the conversational act of revealing aspects of oneself voluntarily, which would otherwise not be possible to be known by the dialog system.",3.1 Coding Self Disclosure,[0],[0]
"A general rule-of-thumb we follow is, self-disclosure is proportional to the amount of extraneous information that is added to a conversation.",3.1 Coding Self Disclosure,[0],[0]
"For example, we do not identify a direct response to a question as self-disclosure as it is not strictly voluntary.",3.1 Coding Self Disclosure,[0],[0]
We show examples of our definition of human selfdisclosure and non-disclosure in the context of our dialog system in Figure.,3.1 Coding Self Disclosure,[0],[0]
2.,3.1 Coding Self Disclosure,[0],[0]
The data for this study was collected by having users from the real-world interact with our open-domain dialog agent.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"The dialog agent was hosted on Amazon Alexa devices as part of the AlexaPrize competition (Ram et al., 2018) and was one of sixteen socialbots that could be invoked by any user within the United States through the command ‘Let’s chat!’.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"The users that interacted with our socialbot were randomly chosen, and did not know which of the sixteen systems they were interacting with.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Users who interacted with our bot over a span of three days (N=1507) were randomly assigned to two groups: one received a bot that self-disclosed at high depth from the beginning of the conversation while the other group interacted with a socialbot that self-disclosed only later about superficial topics like movies and TV shows.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"At the end, both socialbots engaged in free-form conversation with the user, where the initiative of the interaction was on the user and both bots were free to self-disclose at any depth.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"The users were also free to end the interaction at any time, and thus had no motivation for continuing the conversation besides their own enter-
2Not real interaction data, however very similar to actual utterances found in the interaction data
tainment.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"To control the direction of the conversation and bot utterance, we utilize a finite state transducer-based dialog system that chats with the user about movies and TV shows, as well as plays games and supports open-domain conversation (Prabhumoye et al., 2017).",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"State transitions are decided based on sentiment analysis of user utterances, in order to gauge interest in a particular topic.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"Initially the dialog system takes initiative in the conversation and steers the topic of discussion, however later there is a handoff to the user whereby the user can determine the focus of the conversation.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"In this way, the socialbot leads the user through the following topics, conditioned on user interest as shown in Figure 3:",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"Greeting : In this phase, our dialog agent greets the user and asks them about their day.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
The bot which performs high self-disclosure initially also responds with information about it’s day and a personal anecdote.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
TV Shows:,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
The next phase involves chit chat about popular TV shows.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
The dialog agent asks the user if they are an enthusiast of a recent popular TV show and moves on to the next phase of the conversation if they aren’t.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Movie:,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"In this phase, the dialog agent attempts to engage the user in conversations about movies, asking them if they have seen any of the recent ones.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Word Game:,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"In this phase, the dialog agent requests the user to play a word game.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Participation in the game is completely optional and the user can move on to the next phase by stating that they do not wish to play.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
CQA:,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
The last phase supports uninhibited freeform conversation.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
The initiative of the exchange is now on the user and conversation is stateless.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
The dialog system response is determined by a retrieval model.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"For each utterance, the socialbot attempts to retrieve the most relevant response from the Yahoo L6 dataset (yl6, 2017), a dataset containing approximately 4 million questions and
their corresponding answers from the Community Question-Answering (CQA) website, Yahoo Answers 3.
",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"The users were then allowed to rate the interaction on a scale of 1-5, based on the question ‘Would you interact with this socialbot again?’.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
319 users rated the socialbot (Group 1) and 1507 users interacted with our system in total (Group 2).,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"Following this, to preserve confidentiality of the interaction data, one annotator annotated all turns of conversation from Group 1 for self-disclosure.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Annotator reliability was determined by calculating inter-annotator agreement from three external annotators on a carefully prepared anonymized subset of the data amounting to 62 interactions comprising of over 816 turns.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"The Fleiss’ kappa from the four annotators was 63.8, indicating substantial agreement.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Atleast two of three annotators agreed on 93.6% of the reference annotations.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"The full dataset contains a total of 319 conversations, spanning 10751 conversational turns.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"Out of the 5216 human dialog utterances, 13.8% featured some form of self-disclosure.
",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Since our agent is a spoken dialog system in the real world there is some amount of noise in the dataset caused due to ASR errors.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"To estimate this, we randomly sample 100 utterances from the dataset and annotate these utterances for whether they contained an ASR mistake, and if the sentence meaning was still apparent either from context or from the utterance itself.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"We find that at least one ASR error occurs in 13% of user utterances, but 46.1% of utterances with ASR mistakes can still be understood.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"Since our dialog agent relies on sentiment-based FST transitions during the initial stages of the conversation, we also analyze the rate of false transitions in the data.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"We randomly sample 100 utterances from across choice points of all conversations and find that 11% of them consisted of incorrect responses, either due to mistakes in sentiment analysis or due to nu-

ance in the user utterances which rendered a response from the dialog agent unusable.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"Finally, we analyze how many users had multiple interactions with our dialog agent during the course of our study.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
This is relevant as user behavior during a second interaction with the system might differ from initial interaction.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
Users are identifiable only by an anonymized hash key provided by Amazon along with the conversation data.,3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
"We find that out of 316 users who interacted with our dialog agent and left a rating, only 3 interacted with our agent twice and none of them interacted with our agent more than two times, largely allowing us to disregard this effect.",3.2 Dataset Preparation,[0],[0]
We utilize the annotations of 319 conversations to train and evaluate a Machine Learning model to identify user self-disclosure.,3.3 Feature Space Design,[0],[0]
"We categorize the features for this model at two levels, utterancelevel features wherein the user utterance is taken standalone and analyzed for self-disclosure and conversational-level features which consider the utterance in context of the current conversation.",3.3 Feature Space Design,[0],[0]
This represents a class of features that only consider the current utterance.,3.3.1 Utterance Features,[0],[0]

The test distribution contains 12.8% examples of self-disclosure and 87.2% examples of no disclosure.,3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]
We further perform an ablation study of each dialog-context feature as shown in Figure 4.,3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]
"We observe that considering the word in the context of the machine utterance is most helpful in identifying self-disclosure, indicating possibly that it helps us capture the notion of selfdisclosure being a voluntary phenomena whereby the user reveals information about himself or herself, by separating instances of direct answers to questions from turns where users disclose more than what is asked.",3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]
"We next conduct a careful manual error analysis of the mistakes made by our classifier, in an attempt to identify what cases are particularly hard or ambiguous.",3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]
"We observe that 85% of user turns which our model wrongly labeled as containing self-disclosure had personal pronouns, suggesting that our model considers these as a very strong signal for self-disclosure.",3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]
"However many of these utterances were in fact direct responses to questions, or questions to the bot itself prefaced with a personal pronoun, and thus not really instances of self-disclosure.",3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]
"25.9% of the mistakes were not well-formed or meaningful sentences, possibly due to ASR errors, speech disfluencies or user phrasing.",3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]

"In the future, real world knowledge and a larger amount of training data might help mitigate some of these error classes.",3.4 Results of Identification,[0],[0]
"We analyze common markers of reciprocity (Jourard and Jaffe, 1970; Harper and Harper, 2006), such as the usage of personal pronouns, word overlap with the previous sentence (normalized by length of previous utterance) and average user utterance length between two groups of usersones who were shown a bot that self-disclosed ini-

Are Conversations With Initial Self-Disclosure Longer?,4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
We analyze whether whether initial occurrences of user self-disclosure lead to users prolonging the conversation by examining average conversational length for two groups of users : those who decided to self-disclose at the very beginning of the conversation itself and those who didn’t.,4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"We find that users who self-disclose initially tend to have significantly longer conversation than users who do not (p<0.05), with an average conversational length of 37.19 turns compared to an average of 32.4 turns for users who chose not to self-disclose.
Does not self-disclosing initially imply reduced self-disclosure throughout the conversation?",4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
We next examine the hypothesis that users who do not self-disclose initially tend to self-disclose less throughout.,4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"This is based on the notion of openness and guardedness in personality (Stokes, 1987; Sermat and Smyth, 1973) indicating that some individuals are more likely to self-disclose than others.",4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"For this study, we do not consider interactions involving the word game as it prolongs the conversation without giving opportunities for self-disclosure.",4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"We examine to what extent do individuals who refuse to self-disclose initially, self-disclose later in the conversation compared to users who self-disclose from the beginning of the conversation itself.",4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"We find that on average, users who do not choose to self-disclose initially are significantly less likely to self-disclose (p<0.05) even later on in the conversation, only revealing information in 9% of their turns as compared to the 24.6% of turns of other users.

Do users who choose not to self-disclose initially exhibit less interest in following machine interests?,4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"To analyze openness to conversation, we invite users to play a long-winded word game with the dialog system.",4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
We analyze how much self-disclosure correlates with willingness to play the game and length of game playing.,4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"We find that on average users who self-disclose initially are also significantly more open to game-playing than those who don’t (p<0.05), playing on average 4.75 turns of the game compared to an average gameplay of 3.16 turns by other users.",4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"They are also significantly more likely to attempt to play the game (p<0.05), with 34.7% of self-disclosing users attempting to play the game and only 25.1% of non-disclosing users attempting to do so.",4.2 Initial Self-Disclosure and User behavior,[0],[0]
"Motivated by Cozby (1972), we attempt to analyze whether self-disclosure increases likability in human-machine interaction.",4.3 Does Self-Disclosure Increase Likability,[0],[0]
"We utilize the user ratings based on the question ‘Would you talk to this socialbot again’ as a proxy for likability of the dialog agent, and examine whether conversations where the user self-disclosed often were given higher ratings than ones where they didn’t.",4.3 Does Self-Disclosure Increase Likability,[0],[0]
We find that there is negligible correlation in general between user ratings and the amount of selfdisclosure (pearson’s r = 0.01).,4.3 Does Self-Disclosure Increase Likability,[0],[0]
"We then examine the differences in user ratings between the top 20% and bottom 20% of self-disclosing conversations, once more excluding interactions with the game.",4.3 Does Self-Disclosure Increase Likability,[0],[0]
"We observe that while more self-disclosing conversations get higher ratings in general, the results are not statistically significant (average rating of conversations with higher self-disclosure is 3.14 compared to 3.13 for conversations with lesser self-disclosure).",4.3 Does Self-Disclosure Increase Likability,[0],[0]
"Lastly, we analyze the effect of reciprocity and self-disclosure, by analyzing the ratings of users who self-disclosed in response to bot disclosure but find no significant difference in the ratings of such users (3.34 to 3.27).",4.3 Does Self-Disclosure Increase Likability,[0],[0]
Thus we are unable to find any conclusive linear relationship between self-disclosure and likability.,4.3 Does Self-Disclosure Increase Likability,[0],[0]

can significantly influence non-disclosing users, as our results find that users who do not initially selfdisclose continue to self-disclose at reduced levels throughout the conversation.",5 Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]

An important learning question in morphology— both for NLP and models of language acquisition—is the so-called Paradigm Cell Filling Problem (PCFP).,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"So dubbed by Ackerman et al. (2009), this problem asks how it is that speakers of a language can reliably produce inflectional forms of most lexemes without ever witnessing those forms before.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For example, a Finnish noun or adjective can be inflected in 2,263 ways if one includes case forms, number, and clitics (Karlsson, 2008).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, it is unlikely that a Finnish speaker would have heard all forms for even a single, highly frequent lexical item.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It is also unlikely that all 2,263 forms are found in the aggregate of all the witnessed inflected forms over different lexemes and speakers must be able to assess the felicity of, and possibly produce such inflectional combinations they have never witnessed for any noun or adjective.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Figure 1 illustrates the PCFP.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This paper investigates PCFP in three different settings: (1) when we know n > 1 randomly selected forms in each of a number of inflection tables, (2) when we know a set of frequent word forms in each table (this most closely resembles an L1 language learning setting), and finally (3)
1https://github.com/mpsilfve/pcfp-data
when we know exactly n = 1 word form from each table.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We treat settings (1) and (2) as traditional morphological reinflection tasks (Cotterell et al., 2016) as explained in Section 2.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast, setting (3) is substantially more challenging because it cannot be handled using a traditional reinflection approach.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To overcome this problem, we utilize an adaptive dropout mechanism which will be discussed in Section 2.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This allows us to train the reinflection system in a manner reminiscent of denoising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Related Work Neural models have recently been shown to be highly competitive in many different tasks of learning supervised morphological inflection (Faruqui et al., 2016; Kann and Schütze, 2016; Makarov et al., 2017; Aharoni and Goldberg, 2017) and derivation (Cotterell et al., 2017b).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Most current architectures are based on encoderdecoder models (Sutskever et al., 2014), and usually contain an attention component (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The SIGMORPHON (Cotterell et al., 2016) and CoNLL-SIGMORPHON (Cotterell et al., 2017a, 2018) shared tasks in recent years have explored morphological inflection but not explicitly the PCFP.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In the 2017 task, participants were given full paradigms—i.e. a listing of all forms—of
lexemes during training after which they were given incomplete paradigms which had to be completed at test time.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This is a slightly unrealistic setting in an L1-style learning scenario (Blevins and Blevins, 2009) where arguably very few full paradigms are ever witnessed and where generalization has to proceed on a number of very gappy paradigms.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Of course, such gaps form a distribution where frequently used lexemes have fewer gaps than infrequent ones, which we will attempt to model in this work.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Silfverberg et al. (2018) evaluate an extension to a linguistically informed symbolic paradigm model based on stem extraction from the longest common subsequence (LCS) shared among related forms (Ahlberg et al., 2014, 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"While the original LCS paradigm extraction method was intended to learn from complete inflection tables (Hulden, 2014), Silfverberg et al. (2018) present modifications to allow learning from incomplete paradigms as well, and apply it to the PCFP.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Comparing against their results, shows that our neural model consistently outperforms such a subsequence-based learning model.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Kann et al. (2017) report results on so-called multi-source reinflection in which several input forms are used to generate one output form.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This task is related to the PCFP; however, Kann et al. (2017) use full inflection tables for training.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, their approach is applicable for PCFP only when 3 or more forms are given in the input tables.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Since this mostly excludes our experimental settings, we do not compare to their system.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Malouf (2016, 2017) documents an experiment with a generator LSTM in completing inflection tables in up to seven languages with either 10% or 40% of table entries missing.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Our work differs from this in that Malouf gives as input a two-hot encoding of both the lexeme and the desired slot during training and testing for which an inflection table is to be completed, which means the system cannot complete paradigms which it has not seen examples of in the training data.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"By contrast, our system has no notion of lexeme and we simply work from the symbol strings which are collections of inflected forms of a lexeme given in the test data which may in principle be completely disjoint from training data lexemes.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We use the Malouf system as a baseline to compare against.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We explore two different models for paradigm filling.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
The first model is applicable when n > 1 forms are given in each inflection table.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"When exactly one (n = 1) form is given, we use another model.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Case n>1 When more than one form is given in training tables, PCFP can be treated as a morphological reinflection task (Cotterell et al., 2016), where the aim is to translate inflected word forms and their tags into target word forms.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"For example, a model would translate tried+PAST into the present participle (PRES,PCPLE) form trying.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"We adopt a common approach employed by Kann and Schütze (2016) and many others: we build a model which translates an input word form, its tag and a target tag, for example tried+PAST+PRES,PCPLE, into the target word form trying.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
Our model closely follows the formulation of the encoder-decoder LSTM model for morphological reinflection proposed by Kann and Schütze (2016).,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"We use a 1-layer bidirectional LSTM encoder for encoding the input word form into a sequence of state vectors and a 1-layer LSTM decoder with an attention mechanism over encoder states for generating the output word form.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"We form training pairs by using the given forms in each table, i.e. take the cross-product of the given forms and learn to reinflect each given form in a table to another given form in the same table as demonstrated in Figure 2.2 During test time, we predict forms for missing slots based on each of the given forms in the table and take a majority vote of the results.3
Case n=1",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"When only one form is given in each inflection table, we cannot train the model as a traditional reinflection model.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"The best we can do is to train a model to reinflect forms into the same form walked+PAST+PAST 7→ walked and then try to apply this model for reinflection to fill in missing forms walked+PAST+PRES,PCPLE 7→ walking.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"According to preliminary experiments, this however leads to massive over-fitting and the model simply learns to only copy input forms.
2Note that the CoNLL-SIGMORPHON data provides a ‘citation form’ that identifies each table; we do not use this form and the model has no knowledge of it.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"3When only two forms are given in the partial inflection table, we randomly choose one of the resulting output forms since the vote is always tied.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"The idea for our approach in case n = 1 is to first learn to segment word forms into a stem and an affix, for example walk+ed.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
We then hide the affix in the input form and learn to inflect.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"In other words, we map the word form walked into walk$$ and then learn a mapping walk$$+PAST 7→ walked.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"This model suffers less from overfitting and we can use it to find missing forms in partial inflection tables.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Since we do not have access to segmented training data, we cannot directly train a segmentation model.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Instead, we use the forms in the training data to train an LSTM language model conditioned on morphological tags.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"We then use the language model for identifying which characters belong to stems and which characters belong to affixes.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"As shown in Figure 3, the language model in general gives higher confidence for predictions of characters in the affix than in the word stem.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Nevertheless, it only gives a probabilistic segmentation into a stem and affix(es).",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Therefore, we do not perform a deterministic segmentation.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
Instead we use the language model to guide a character dropout mechanism in our word inflection model.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"When the language model is very confident, as in the case of affix characters, we frequently drop characters.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"In contrast, when the language model
is less confident, as in the case of stem characters, we typically keep the character.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Apart from this adaptive dropout applied during training, our inflection system in case n = 1 is exactly the same as in case n >",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"1.
More precisely, given an input word form, which is a sequence of characters x = x1, ..., xT , the LSTM language model emits a probability p(xt+1,ht,Ext ,Ey) for the next character xt+1 based on the entire previous input sequence x1, ..., xt.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Here ht is the hidden state vector of the language model at position t, E a joint tag and character embedding and y the morphological tag of the input word form.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
The embedding vector Ey is in fact a sum of sub-tag embeddings.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"For example, EPAST+PCPLE denotes EPAST+EPCPLE.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
This allows us to handle combinations of subtags which we have not seen in the training data.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"Guided by the language model, we replace input characters xt+1 during training of the reinflection system with a dropout character $ with probability equal to language model confidence p(xt+1,ht,Ext ,Ey).",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"4
Baseline Model As a baseline model, we use the neural system presented by Malouf (2016, 2017) for solving PCFP.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
It is an LSTM generator which is conditioned on the table number of the partial inflection tables and the morphological tag index.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
The model is trained to generate training word forms in inflection tables.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"During testing, it can then generate missing forms by conditioning on morphological tags for the missing forms.
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"In order to assure fair comparison, we perform the paradigm completion experiment described in Malouf (2017), where 90% of the word forms in the data set is used for training and the remaining 10% for testing.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
5,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"As the results in Table 1 show,
4In practice, we pad input forms with end-of-sequence characters in order to be able to drop x1 if needed.
5We perform the the experiments on the original data sets,
our results very closely replicate those reported by Malouf (2017).
",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
Implementation details,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"We use 1-layer bidirectional LSTM encoders, decoders and generators with embeddings and hidden states of size 100.",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
We train the language model for case n >,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
1 for 20 epochs and all other models for 60 epochs without batching.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
We train 10 models for every language and part-of-speech and apply majority voting to get the final output forms.,2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"All models were implemented using DyNet (Neubig et al., 2017).",2 Encoder-Decoder Models for PCFP,[0],[0]
"We use UniMorph morphological paradigm data in our experiments (Kirov et al., 2018).",3 Data,[0],[0]
Unimorph data sets are crowd-sourced collections of morphological inflection tables based on Wiktionary.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"We conduct experiments on noun and verb paradigms from eight languages.6 Not all languages have 1,000 noun and verb tables.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"Hence, our selection is not complete as seen in Table 3.
",3 Data,[0],[0]
"We conduct experiments on two different sets of tables: (1) we randomly sample 1,000 tables for each language and part-of-speech, and (2) we select Unimorph tables including some of the 10,000 most common word forms according to Wikipedia frequency.",3 Data,[0],[0]
"The Wikipedia word frequencies are based on plain Wikipedia text dumps from the Polyglot project (Al-Rfou et al., 2013).",3 Data,[0],[0]
Georgian and Latin did not have a Polyglot Wikipedia,3 Data,[0],[0]
so we excluded those.,3 Data,[0],[0]
"Moreover, we excluded Latvian verbs because there was very little overlap between the most frequent Wikipedia word forms and Unimorph table entries (< 200 forms occurred in both).",3 Data,[0],[0]
"Details for both types of data sets are given in Tables 3 and 2.
",3 Data,[0],[0]

"This may influence results.

We perform two experiments.,4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"In the first one, we take the set of 1,000 randomly sampled inflection tables for each language and part-of-speech and then randomly select n=1, 2 or 3 training forms from each table.",4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
We then train a reinflection system on these forms and use the resulting system to predict the missing forms.,4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
We report accuracy on correctly predicted missing forms and on reconstructing the entire paradigm correctly.,4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"In our second experiment, we consider Unimorph tables which contain entries from a list of 10,000 most common word tokens compiled using a Wikipedia dump of the language as explained above.",4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"We take the forms in the top-10,000 list as given and train a model which is used to reconstruct the remaining forms in each table.",4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
We train an identical model as in the case n > 1 on tables with more than one given form.,4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"As in the first task, we evaluate with regard to accuracy for reconstructed forms and full tables.",4 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]

Its paradigm consists of eight forms but four of those are identical: Gräben.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]

This strongly biases the system to copying input forms into the output.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]

There is a notable transition from witnessing one form in each inflection table to witnessing two forms.,5 Discussion and Conclusions,[0],[0]

"Human-human conversation has flexible turntaking behavior: back channeling, overlapping speech and smooth turn transitions.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
Imitating human-like turn-taking in a spoken dialog system (SDS) is challenging due to the degradation in quality of the dialog when overlapping speech is produced in the wrong place.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For this, a traditional SDS often uses a simplified turn-taking model with rigid turn taking.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
They only respond when users have finished speaking.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Thus past research has mostly focused on end-of-turn detection, finding the end of the user utterance as quickly as possible while minimizing the chance of wrongly interrupting the users.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We refer here to the interruption issue as false cut-ins (FCs).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Recent research in incremental dialog processing promises more flexible turn-taking behavior (Atterer et al., 2008; Breslin et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Here, the automatic speech recognizer (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) incrementally
produce partial decoding/understating messages for decision-making.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This allows for system barge-in (SB), starting to respond before end-of-utterance.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Although this framework has shown promising results in creating flexible SDSs, the following two fundamental issues remain:
1.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
We need a model that unifies incremental processing and traditional turn-taking behavior.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
2.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We also need a systematic procedure that trains a system to produce meaningful SBs.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This paper first proposes a finite state machine (FSM) that both shows superior performance in end-of-turn detection compared to previous methods and is compatible with incremental processing.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Then we propose a systematic procedure to endow a system with meaningful SB by combining the theory of optimal stopping with reinforcement learning.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Section 2 of the paper discusses related work; Section 3 describes the finite state machine; Sections 4, 5, and 6 describe how to produce meaningful SB; Section 7 gives experimental results of an evaluation using the CMU Let’s Go Live system and simulation results on the Dialog State Tracking Challenging (DTSC) Corpus and Section 8 concludes.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This work is closely related to end-of-turn detection and incremental processing (IP) dialog systems.
",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
There are several methods for detecting the endof-turn.,2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
Raux (2008) built a decision tree for final pause duration using ASR and NLU features.,2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"At runtime, the system first dynamically chooses the final pause duration threshold based on the dialog state and then predicts end-of-turn if final pause duration is longer than that threshold.",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
Other work explored predicting end-of-turn within a user’s speech.,2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"This showed substantial improvement in speed of response (Raux and Eske-
42
nazi, 2009).",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"Another approach examined prosodic and semantic features such as pitch and speaking rate in human-human conversation for turn-yielding cues (Gravano, 2009).
",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"The key limitation of those methods is that the decision made by the end-of-turn detector is treated as a “hard” decision, obliging developers to compromise in a tradeoff between response latency and FC rate (Raux and Eskenazi, 2008).",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"Although adding more complex prosodic and semantic features can improve the performance of the detector, it also increases computation cost and requires significant knowledge of the SDS, which can limit the accessibility for non-expert developers.
",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"For IP, Kim (2014) has demonstrated the possibility of learning turn-taking from human dialogs using inverse reinforcement learning.",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"Other work has focused on incremental NLU (DeVault et al., 2009), showing that the correct interpretation of users’ meaning can be predicted before end-of-turn.",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
Another topic is modeling user and system barge-in.,2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
Selfridge (2013) has presented a FSM that predicts users’ barge-ins.,2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"Also, Ghigi (2014) has shown that allowing SB when users produce lengthy speech increases robustness and task success.
",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
"Different from Kim’s work that learns humanlike turn-taking, our approach is more related to Ghigi’s method, which tries to improve dialog efficiency from a system-centric perspective.",2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
We take one step further by optimizing the turn-taking using all available features based on a global objective function with machine learning methods.,2 Related Work and Limitations,[0],[0]
Our model has two distinct modes: passive and active.,3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
The passive mode exhibits traditional rigid turn-taking behavior while the active mode has the system respond in the middle of a user turn.,3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"We first describe how these two modes operate, and then show how they are compatible with existing incremental dialog approaches.
",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
The idea is to combine an aggressive speaker with a patient listener.,3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
The speaker consists of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) modules.,3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
The listener is composed of the ASR and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) modules.,3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
The system attempts to respond to a user every time it detects a short pause (e.g. 100ms).,3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"But before a long pause (e.g. 1000ms) is detected, the user’s continued speech will stop the system from
responding, as shown on Figure 1:
Most of the system’s attempts to respond will thus be FCs.",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"However, since the listener can stop the system from speaking, the FCs have no effect on the conversation (users may hear the false start of the system’s prompt, but often the respond state is cancelled before the synthesized speech begins).",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"If the attempt is correct, however, the system responds with almost 0-latency, as shown in Figure 2.",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, because the dialog manager (DM) can receive partial ASR output whenever there is a short pause, this model produces relatively stable partial ASR output and supports incremental dialog processing.
",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"We then define the short pause as the action threshold (AT) and the long pause as the listening threshold (LT), where 0 < AT ≤ LT, which can be interpreted respectively as the “aggression” and “patience” of the system.",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"By changing the value of each of these thresholds we can modify the system’s behavior from rigid turn taking to active SB.
1.",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"Passive Agent: act fast and listen patiently (AT = small value, LT = large value)
2.",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
Active Agent: act and listen impatiently.,3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"(AT = LT = small value)
",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"This abstraction simplifies the challenge: “when the system should barge in” as the following transition: PassiveAgent Φ(dialog state)−−−−−−−−−→ ActiveAgent where Φ(·) : dialog State → {true, false} is a function that outputs true whenever the agent should take the floor, regardless of the current state of the floor.",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"For example, this function could output true when the current dialog states fulfill certain rules in a hand-crafted system, or could output true when the system has reached its maximal understanding of the user’s intention (DeVault et al., 2009).",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"A natural next step is to use statistical techniques to learn an optimized Φ(·) based on all features related to the dialog states, in order to support more complex SB behavior.",3.1 Model Description,[0],[0]
"First our model solves end-of-turn detection by using a combination of VAD and TTS control, instead of trying to build a perfect classifier.",3.2 Advantages over Past Methods,[0],[0]
This avoids the tradeoff between response latency and FC.,3.2 Advantages over Past Methods,[0],[0]
"Under the assumption that the TTS can operate at high speed, the proposed system can achieve almost 0-lag and 0-FC by setting AT to be small (e.g. 100ms).",3.2 Advantages over Past Methods,[0],[0]
"Second, the model does not require expensive prosodic and semantic turn-yielding cue detectors, thus simplifying the implementation.",3.2 Advantages over Past Methods,[0],[0]
"In state-of-the-art SDS, the DM uses explicit/implicit confirmation to fill each slot and carries out an error recovery strategy for incorrectly recognized slots (Bohus and Rudnicky, 2009).",4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"The system should receive many correctly-recognized slots, thus avoiding lengthy error recovery.",4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"While a better ASR and NLU could help, Ghigh (2014) has shown that allowing the system to actively respond to users also leads to more correct slots.
",4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
Table 1 demonstrates three cases where active SB can help.,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
The first two rows show the first half of the user’s speech being correctly recognized while the second half is not.,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"In this scenario, if, in the middle of the utterance, the system can tell that the existing ASR hypothesis is sufficient and actively barges on the user, it can potentially avoid the poorly-recognized speech that follows.",4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
The third example has noise at the beginning of the user turn.,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
The system could back channel in the middle of the utterance to ask the user to go to a quieter place or to repeat an answer.,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"In these examples active SB can help improve robustness:
1.",4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
Barge in when the current hypothesis has high confidence and contains sufficient information to move the dialog along.,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
2. Barge in when the hypothesis confidence is low and the predicted future hypothesis will not get better.,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"This can avoid recovering from a large number of incorrect slots.
",4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
A natural choice of objective function to train such a system is to maximize the expected quality of information in the users’ utterances.,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
The quality of the recognized information is positively correlated to number of correctly recognized slots (CS) and inversely correlated to the number of incorrectly recognized slots (ICS).,4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"In the next section, we describe how we transform CS and ICS into a real-value reward.",4 Toward Active System Barge-in,[0],[0]
We first design a cost model that defines a reward function.,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
This model is based on the assumption that the system will use explicit confirmation for every slot.,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
We choose this because it is the most basic dialog strategy.,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"A sample dialog for this strategy is as follows:
Sys: Where do you want to leave from?",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
User:,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
Leaving from X. Sys: Do you mean leaving from Y?,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]

I am leaving from X. Sys: Do you mean X?,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
User:,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"Yes.
Given this dialog strategy the system spends one turn asking the question, and k turns confirming k slots in the user response.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"Also, for no-parse (0 slot) input, the system asks the same question again.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"Therefore, the minimum number of turns required
to acquire n slots is 2n.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"However, because user responses contain ICS and no-parses, the system takes more than 2n turns to obtain all the slot information (assume confirmation are never misrecognized).
",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
We denote csi and icsi as the number of correctly/incorrectly recognized slots in the user response.,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"So the quality of the user response is captured by a tuple, (csi, icsi).",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"The goal is to obtain a reward function that maps from a given user response (csi, icsi) to a reward value ri ∈",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
<.,5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"This reward value should correlate with the overall efficiency of a dialog, which is inversely correlated with the number of turns needed for task completion.
",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"Then for a dialog task that has n slots to fill, we can denote hi as the number of turns already spent, fi as the estimated number of future turns needed for task completion and E[S] as the expected number of turns needed to fill 1 slot.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]

"Based on the above setup, it is clear that hi + fi equals the estimated total number of turns needed to fill n slots.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"Then the reward, ri, associated with each user response can be expressed as the difference between the previous and current estimates:

"+ (E[S]− 1)︸ ︷︷ ︸

csi − icsi (4)
Therefore, a positive reward means the new user response reduces the estimated number of turns for task completion while a negative reward means the opposite.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"Another interpretation of this reward function is that for no-parse user response (csi = 0, icsi = 0), the cost is to waste 1 turn asking the same question again.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"When there is a parse, each correct slot can save E[S] turns in the future, while each slot, regardless of its correctness, needs a 1- turn confirmation.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]
"As a result, this rewards function is correlated with the global efficiency of a dialog because it assigns a corpus-dependent weight to csi, based on E[S] estimated from historical dialogs.",5 A Cost Model for System Barge-in,[0],[0]

",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"In an episode, the turn-taking decider will see each partial hypothesis sequentially over time, At each hypothesis it takes an action from {wait, stop}.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
Wait means it continues to listen.,6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
Stop means it takes the floor.,6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"The turn-taking decider receives 0 reward for taking the action wait and receives the reward ri from (csi, icsi) according to our cost model for taking the action stop.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"This is an optimal stopping problem that can be formulated as an MDP:
• S = {x1, ...{x1...xK}} • A = {wait, stop} • R = −1 + (E[S]− 1)csi − icsi",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]

"The first equation shows that the Q-value for any state, s, with action, stop, is simply the immediate reward for s. The second equation shows that the Q-value for any state s, with action, wait, only depends on the future return by following policy π.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"This result is crucial because it means that Qπ(s, stop) for any state, s, can be directly calculated based on the cost model, independent of the policy π.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"Also, given a policy π, Qπ(s, wait)can also be directly calculated as the discounted reward the first time that the policy chooses to stop.
",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"Meanwhile, for a given episode with known reward ri for each partial hypothesis pi, optimal stopping means always to stop at the largest reward, meaning that we can obtain the oracle action for the training corpus.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]

"This special property of optimal stopping problem allows us to use supervised learning methods directly modeling the optimal Q function, by finding a mapping from the input state space, si, into the Q-value for both actions: Q(si, stop)∗ and Q(si, wait)∗.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"Further, inspired by the work of reinforcement learning as classification (Lagoudakis and Parr, 2003), we decide to map directly from the input state space into the action space: S → A∗, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"Advantages of solving this problem as a classification rather than a regression include: 1) it explicitly models sign(Q(si, stop)∗−Q(si, wait)∗), which sufficiently determines the behavior of the agent.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"2) SVM is known as a state-of-the-art modeler for the binary classification task, due to its ability to find the separating hyperplane in nonlinear space.",6.2 Solving Active Turn-taking,[0],[0]
"Since SVM requires a fixed input dimension size, while the available features will continue to increase as the turn-taking decider observes more partial hypotheses, we adopt the functional idea used by the openSMILE toolkit (Eyben et al., 2010).",6.3 Feature Construction,[0],[0]
"There are three categories of features: immediate feature, delta feature and long-term feature.",6.3 Feature Construction,[0],[0]
Immediate features come from the ASR and the NLU in the latest partial hypothesis.,6.3 Feature Construction,[0],[0]
Delta features are the first-order derivate of immediate features with respect to the previous observed feature.,6.3 Feature Construction,[0],[0]
"Long-term features are global statistics associated with all the observed features.

"Table 2 shows that we have 18 immediate features, 18 delta features and 18× 7 = 126 long-term features.",6.3 Feature Construction,[0],[0]

The final feature set contains 138 features.,6.3 Feature Construction,[0],[0]
We conducted a live study and a simulation study.,7 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
The live study evaluates the model’s end-of-turn detection.,7 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
The simulated study evaluates the active SB behavior.,7 Experiments and Results,[0],[0]
"The finite state machine was implemented in the Interaction Manager of the CMU Lets Go system that provides bus information in Pittsburgh (Raux et al., 2005).",7.1 Live Study,[0],[0]
"We compared base system data from November 1-30, 2014 (773 dialogs), to data from our system from December 1-31, 2014 (565 dialogs).
",7.1 Live Study,[0],[0]
"The base system used the decision tree endof-turn detector described in (Raux and Eskenazi, 2008) and the active SB algorithm described in (Ghigi et al., 2014).",7.1 Live Study,[0],[0]
The action threshold (AT) in the new system was set at 60% of the decision tree output in the former system and the listening threshold (LT) was empirically set at 1200ms.,7.1 Live Study,[0],[0]
We observed that FCs result in several users’ utterances having overlapping timestamps due to a builtin 500ms padding before an utterances in PocketSphinx.,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
This means that we consider two consecutive utterances with a pause less than 500ms as one utterance.,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"Figure 4 shows that when the end-of-turn detector produces an FC, the continued flow of user
speech instantiates a new user utterance which overlaps with the previous one.",7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"In this example, utterances 0 and 1 have overlaps while utterance 2 does not.",7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"So users actually produce two utterances, while the system thinks there are three due to FC.
",7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"Thus, we can automatically calculate the FC rate of every dialog, by counting the number of user utterances with overlaps.",7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"We define an utterance fragment ratio (UFR) that measures the FC rate in a dialog.
",7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"UFR = Number of user utterances with overlapsTotal number of user utterances
We also manually label task success (TS) of all the dialogs.",7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
We define TS as: a dialog is successful if and only if the system conducted a back-end search for bus information with all required slots correctly recognized.,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"In summary, we use the following metrics to evaluate the new system:
1.",7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
Task success rate 2.,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
Utterance fragment ratio (UFR) 3.,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
Average number of system barge-in (ANSB) 4.,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"Proportion of long user utterances interrupted

Average response delay (ARD) 6.,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
Average user utterance duration over time,7.2 Live Study Metrics,[0],[0]
Table 3 shows that the TS rate of the new system is 7.5% higher than the previous system (p-value < 0.01).,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
Table 4 shows that overall UFR decreased by 37.1%.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
UFR for successful and for failed dialogs indicates that the UFR decreases more in failed dialogs than in successful ones.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
One explanation is that failed dialogs usually have a noisier environment.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
"The UFR reduction explains the increase in success rate since UFRs are positively correlated with TS rate, as reported in (Zhao and Eskenazi, 2015)
",7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
Table 5 shows that the SB algorithm was activated more often in the new system.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
"This is because the SB algorithm described in (Ghigi et al., 2014) only activates for user utterances longer than 3 seconds.",7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
"FCs will therefore hinder the ability of this algorithm to reliably measure user utterance dura-
tion.",7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
This is an example of how reliable end-of-turn detection can benefit other SDS modules.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
Table 5 also shows that the new system is 32.5% more responsive than the old system.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
"We purposely set the action threshold to 60% of the threshold in the old system, which demonstrates that the new model can have an response speed equals to action threshold that is independent of the FC rate.
",7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
Figure 5 shows how average user utterance duration evolves in a dialog.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
Utterance duration is more stable in the new system than in the old one.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
"Two possible explanations are: 1) since UFR is much higher in the old system, the system is more likely to cut in at the wrong time, possibly making users abandon their normal turn-taking behavior and talk over the system.",7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
2) more frequent activation of the SB algorithm entrains the users to produce more concise utterances.,7.3 Live Study Results,[0],[0]
"This part of the experiment uses the DSTC corpus training2 (643 dialogs) (Black et al., 2013).",7.4 Simulation Study,[0],[0]
The data was manually transcribed.,7.4 Simulation Study,[0],[0]
"The reported 1-best word error rate (WER) is 58.2% (Williams et al., 2013).",7.4 Simulation Study,[0],[0]
"This study focuses on all user responses to:“Where are you leaving from?” and “Where are you going?” which have 688 and 773 utterances respectively.
",7.4 Simulation Study,[0],[0]
"An automatic script, based on the manual transcription, labels the number of correct and incorrect
slots (csi, icsi) for each partial hypothesis, pi.",7.4 Simulation Study,[0],[0]
"Also from the training data, the expected number of turns needed to obtain 1 slot, E[S], is 3.82.",7.4 Simulation Study,[0],[0]
"For simplicity, E[S] is set to be 4.",7.4 Simulation Study,[0],[0]
"So the reward function discussed in Section 5 is: ri = −1 + 3csi − icsi.

"After obtaining the reward value for each hypothesis, the oracle action at each partial hypothesis is calculated based on the procedure discussed in Section 6.3 with γ = 1.

The evaluation metrics have two parts: classification-related (precision and recall) and dialog-related.,7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]

"Average reward = 1/T ∑ i ri , where T is the
number of utterances in the test set.",7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]
The learned policy is compared to two reference systems: the oracle and the baseline system.,7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]
The oracle directly follows optimal policy obtained from the ground-truth label.,7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"The baseline system always waits for the last partial (no SB).
",7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, a simple smoothing algorithm is applied to the SVM output for comparison.",7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]
This algorithm confirms the stop action after two consecutive stop outputs from the classifier.,7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]
This increases the classifier’s precision.,7.5 Simulation Study Metrics,[0],[0]
10-fold cross validation was conducted on the two datasets.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"Instead of using the SVM binary output, we apply a global threshold of 0.4 on the SVM decision function for output to achieve the best average reward.",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"The threshold is determined based on cross-validation on training data.
",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
Table 6 shows that the SVM classifier can achieve very high precision and high recall in predicting the correct action.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"The F-measure (after smoothing) is 84.46% for departure question responses and 85.99% for arrival questions.
",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
Table 7 shows that learned policy increases the average reward by 27.7% and 14.9% compared to the baseline system for the departure and arrival responses respectively.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
We notice that the average reward of the baseline arrival responses is significantly higher.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"A possible reason is that by this second question the users are adapting to the system.
",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
The decrease in average utterance duration shows some interesting results.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"For responses to both questions, the oracle system utterance duration is about 55% shorter than the baseline one.",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"The learned policy is also 45% shorter, which means that at about the middle of a user utterance, the system can already predict that the user either has expressed enough information or that the ASR is so wrong that there is no point of continuing to listen.
",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"Table 8 expands our understanding of the oracle
and learned policy behaviors.",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"We see that the oracle produces a much higher percentage of no-parse utterances in order to maximize the average reward, which, at first, seems counter-intuitive.",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
The reason is that some utterances contain a large number of incorrect slots at the end and the oracle chooses to barge in at the beginning of the utterance to avoid the large negative reward for waiting until the end.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
This is the expected behavior discussed in Section 4.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
The learned policy is more conservative in producing no-parse utterances because it cannot cheat like the oracle to access future information and know that all future hypotheses will contain only incorrect information.,7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]
"However, although the learned policy only has access to historical information, it manages to predict future return by increasing CS and reducing ICS compared to the baseline.",7.6 Simulation Study Results,[0],[0]

"However, while both of these
models have the ability to privilege self-transitions, they contain no notion of similarity for pairs of states that are not identical: in both cases, when the transition matrix is integrated out, the prior probability of transitioning to state j′ depends only on the top-level stick weight associated with state j′, and not on the identity or parameters of the previous state j.
The two main contributions of this paper are (1) a generalization of the HDP-HMM, which we call the HDP-HMM with local transitions (HDP-HMM-LT) that allows for a geometric structure to be defined on the latent state space, so that “nearby” states are a priori more likely to have transitions between them, and (2) a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm for this model.",1.

"Another setting where the LT property is useful is when there is a notion of state geometry that licenses syllogisms: e.g., if A frequently leads to B and C and B frequently leads to D and E, then it may be sensible to infer that A and C may lead to D and E as well.",1.

"We have defined a new probabilistic model, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model with Local Transitions (HDP-HMM-LT), which generalizes the HDP-HMM by allowing state space geometry to be represented via a similarity kernel, making transitions between “nearby” pairs of states (“local” transitions), more likely a priori.",5.

"However, knowledge bases suffer from incompleteness despite their formidable sizes (Socher et al., 2013; West et al., 2014), leading to a number of studies on automatic knowledge base completion (KBC) (Nickel et al., 2015) or link prediction.

"As a seminal work, Bordes et al. (2013) proposes the TransE, which models the statistical regularities with linear translations between entity embeddings operated by a relation embedding.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Implicitly, TransE assumes both entity embeddings and relation embeddings dwell in the same vector space, posing an unnecessarily strong prior.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"To relax this requirement, a variety of models first project the entity embeddings to a relationdependent space (Bordes et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015b; Nguyen et al., 2016b), and then model the translation property in the projected space.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Typically, these relation-dependent spaces are characterized by the projection matrices unique to each relation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"As a benefit, different aspects of the same entity can be temporarily emphasized or depressed as an effect of the projection.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, STransE (Nguyen et al., 2016b) utilizes two projection matrices per relation, one for the head entity and the other for the tail entity.

"Despite the superior performance of STransE compared to TransE, it is more prone to the data sparsity problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"Since the number of paths grows exponentially with its length, as a side effect, path-based models enjoy much more training cases, suffering less from the problem.

"In this paper, we propose an interpretable knowledge transfer model (ITransF), which encourages the sharing of statistic regularities between the projection matrices of relations and alleviates the data sparsity problem.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"As discussed above, a fundamental weakness in TransR and STransE is that they equip each relation with a set of unique projection matrices, which not only introduces more parameters but also hinders knowledge sharing.",3.1 Model,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, many relations share some concepts with each other, although they are stored as independent symbols in KB.",3.1 Model,[0],[0]

both describe a person’s high-quality work which wins an award or a nomination respectively.,3.1 Model,[0],[0]
"This phenomenon suggests that one relation actually represents a collection of real-world concepts, and one concept
can be shared by several relations.",3.1 Model,[0],[0]
"Inspired by the existence of such lower-level concepts, instead of defining a unique set of projection matrices for every relation, we can alternatively define a small set of concept projection matrices and then compose them into customized projection matrices.",3.1 Model,[0],[0]
"Effectively, the relation-dependent translation space is then reduced to the smaller concept spaces.
",3.1 Model,[0],[0]
"However, in general, we do not have prior knowledge about what concepts exist out there and how they are composed to form relations.",3.1 Model,[0],[0]
"Therefore, in ITransF, we propose to learn this information simultaneously from data, together with all knowledge embeddings.",3.1 Model,[0],[0]

"For convenience, we refer to the parameters with and without the sparse constraints as the sparse partition and the dense partition, respectively.",3.2 Block Iterative Optimization,[0],[0]

The proposed approach is also based on sketching A using RLA tools such as the count-min sketch of Clarkson & Woodruff (2013) and the sub-sampled Randomized Hadamard Transform of Ailon & Chazelle (2009); Sarlós (2006); Drineas et al. (2011).,1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"Compared to our work, notice that their dependency on ε is exponentially higher: our approach has a running time that grows with ln(1/ε) whereas the above bound grows proportionally to 1/ε2.",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"Additionally, our analysis can be made to depend on the degrees of freedom of the ridge-regression problem (see Theorem 2 and Section 2.1).",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"Finally, we complement the bounds on the MSE for the response vector presented in Theorem 6 of Chen et al. (2015) with a relative-error guarantee on the MSE of the solution vector (see Theorem 4).",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]

"Recently, Wang et al. (2017) presented many results on ridge-regression problems assuming n d.",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"In this setting,
the main motivation for ridge regression is to deal with the potential ill-conditioning of the design matrix A. Wang et al.

"Indeed, the authors provide strong motivation that clarifies the need for algorithms for regression problems whose running times depends on ln(1/ε) in order to achieve ε-relative-error approximations.",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
We emphasize that the transition from standard to regularized regression problems as well as from the overto the under-constrained case is far from trivial.,1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]

",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"Another line of research that motivated our approach was the recent introduction of ridge leverage scores (Alaoui & Mahoney, 2015; Cohen et al., 2017).",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"Indeed, our Theorem 2 presents a structural result that can be satisfied (with high probability) by sampling columns of A with probabilities proportional to (exact or approximate) ridge leverage scores (see Section 2.1).",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
The number of sampled predictor variables (columns of A) is proportional to O(dλ ln dλ).,1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing a strong accuracy guarantee for ridge regression problems when the ridge leverage scores are used to sample predictor variables, in one or more iterations.",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"We also note a recent application of ridge leverage scores (Calandriello et al., 2017a;b) where the authors presented a row sampling algorithm in order to construct a kernel sketch which is eventually used in a second-order gradient-based method for online kernel convex optimization.

"In yet another relevant line of work, much research recently focused on the computation and inversion of the kernel ma-
trix AAT (or ATA).",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"A number of recent papers have considered the problem of fast kernel approximation for large datasets (Zhang et al., 2015; Avron et al., 2017b; Musco & Musco, 2017; Calandriello et al., 2017c; Wang et al., 2017).",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]
"However, direct comparison of the bounds presented in the aforementioned papers and our work is not straightforward, since our objective (accuracy of the approximate solution vector) is different than the objective of the above papers.",1.2. Prior Work,[0],[0]

"Finally, Gonen et al.

This potentially offers significant memory savings compared to its binary or full floating precision counterparts.,4.2. Ternary Networks,[0],[0]
We begin with a discussion of the results presented thus far.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
We first introduced the viewpoint that deep learning can be regarded as a discrete-time optimal control problem.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Consequently, an important result in optimal control theory, the Pontryagin’s maximum principle, can be applied to give a set of necessary conditions for optimality.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
These are in general stronger conditions than the usual optimality conditions based on the vanishing of first-order partial derivatives.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, they apply to broader contexts such as problems with constraints on the trainable parameters or problems that are non-differentiable in the trainable parameters.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]

"We showed that they are justified for conventional neural networks, but not necessarily so for all neural networks (e.g. binary, ternary networks).
",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Next, based on the PMP, we introduced an iterative projection technique, the discrete method of successive approximations (MSA), to find an optimal solution of the learning problem.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"A rigorous error estimate (Theorem 2) is derived for the discrete MSA, which can be used to both understand its dynamics and to derive useful algorithms.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
This should be viewed as the main theoretical result of the present paper.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Note that the usual back-propagation with gradient descent can be regarded as a simple modification of the MSA, if differentiability conditions are assumed (see Appendix C).",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Nevertheless, we note that Theorem 2 itself does not assume any regularity conditions with respect to the trainable parameters.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, neither does it require the convexity conditions in Theorem 1, and hence applies to a wider range of neural networks, including those in Sec. 4.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"All results up to this point apply to general neural networks (assuming that the respective conditions are satisfied), and are not specific to the applications presented subsequently.
",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In the last part of this work, we apply our results to devise training algorithms for discrete-weight neural networks, i.e. those with trainable parameters that can only take values in a discrete set.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Besides potential applications in model deployment in low-memory devices, the main reasons for choosing such applications are two-fold.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"First, gradientdescent updates are not applicable by itself because small updates to parameters are prohibited by the discrete equality constraint on the trainable parameters.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, our method based on the MSA is applicable since it does not perform gradient-descent updates.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Second, in such applications the potentially expensive Hamiltonian maximization steps in the MSA have explicit solutions.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
This makes MSA an attractive optimization method for problems of this nature.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In Sec 4, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on various benchmark datasets.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Interestingly, the ternary
network exhibits extremely sparse weights that perform almost as well as its binary counter-part (see Fig. 2).",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Also, the phenomena of overfitting in Fig. 1 and 2 are interesting as overfitting is generally less common in stochastic gradient based optimization approaches.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"This seems to suggest that the MSA based methods optimize neural networks in a rather different way.
",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Let us now put our work in the context of the existing literature.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"First, the optimal control approach we adopt is quite different from the prevailing viewpoint of nonlinear programming (Bertsekas, 1999; Bazaraa et al., 2013; Kuhn & Tucker, 2014) and the analysis of the derived gradient-based algorithms (Moulines, 2011; Shamir & Zhang, 2013; Bach & Moulines, 2013; Xiao & Zhang, 2014; Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2014) for the training of deep neural networks.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In particular, the PMP (Thm. 1) and the MSA error estimate (Thm. 2) do not assume differentiability and do not characterize optimality via gradients (or sub-gradients) with respect to trainable parameters.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this sense, it is a stronger and more robust condition, albeit sometimes requiring different assumptions.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"The optimal control and dynamical
systems viewpoint has been discussed in the context of deep learning in E (2017); Li et al. (2018) and dynamical systems based discretization schemes has been introduced in Haber & Ruthotto (2017); Chang et al. (2017).",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Most of these works have theoretical basis in continuous-time dynamical systems.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In particular, Li et al. (2018) analyzed continuous-time analogues of neural networks in the optimal control framework and derived MSA-based algorithms in continuous time.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In contrast, the present work presents a discrete-time formulation, which is natural in the usual context of deep learning.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"The discrete PMP turns out to be more subtle, as it requires additional assumptions of convexity of reachable sets (Thm. 1).",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Note also that unlike the estimates derived in Li et al. (2018), Thm. 2 holds rigorously for discrete-time neural networks.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"The present method for stabilizing the MSA is also different from that in Li et al. (2018), where augmented Lagrangian type of modifications are employed.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
The latter would not be effective here because weights cannot be updated infinitesimally without violating the binary/ternary constraint.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Moreover, the present methods that rely on explicit solutions of Hamiltonian maximization are fast (comparable to SGD) on a wall-clock basis.
",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In the deep learning literature, the connection between optimal control and deep learning has been qualitative discussed in LeCun (1988) and applied to the development of automatic differentiation and back-propagation (Bryson, 1975; Baydin et al., 2015).",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"However, there are relatively fewer works relating optimal control algorithms to training neural networks beyond the classical gradient-descent with back-propagation.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Optimal control based strategies in hyper-parameter tuning has been discussed in Li et al. (2017b).
",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In the continuous-time setting, the Pontryagin’s maximum principle and the method of successive approximations have a long history, with a large body of relevant literature including, but not limited to Boltyanskii et al. (1960); Pontryagin (1987); Bryson (1975); Bertsekas (1995); Athans & Falb (2013); Krylov & Chernousko (1962); Aleksandrov (1968); Krylov & Chernousko (1972); Chernousko & Lyubushin (1982); Lyubushin (1982).",5.

"The discrete-time PMP have been studied in Halkin (1966); Holtzman (1966a); Holtzman & Halkin (1966); Holtzman (1966b); Canon et al. (1970), where Theorem 1 and its extensions are proved.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"To the best of our knowledge, the discrete-time MSA and its quantitative analysis have not been performed in either the deep learning or the optimal control literature.
",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Sec. 4 concerns the application of the MSA, in particular Thm. 2, to develop training algorithms for binary and ternary neural networks.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"There are a number of prior work exploring the training of similar neural networks, such as Courbariaux et al. (2015); Hubara et al. (2016); Rastegari et al.
(2016); Tang et al. (2017); Li et al. (2016); Zhu et al. (2016).",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Theoretical analysis for the case of convex loss functions is carried out in Li et al. (2017a).,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Our point of numerical comparison for the binary MSA algorithm is Courbariaux et al. (2015), where optimization of binary networks is based on shadow variables with full floating-point precision that is iteratively truncated to obtain gradients.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"We showed in Sec. 4.1 that the binary MSA is competitive as a training algorithm, but is in need of modifications to reduce overfitting for certain datasets.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
Training ternary networks has been discussed in Hwang & Fan (1967); Kim et al. (2014); Li et al. (2016); Zhu et al. (2016).,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
The difference in our ternary formulation is that we explore the sparsification of networks using a regularization parameter.,5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this sense it is related to compression of neural networks (e.g. Han et al. (2015)), but our approach trains a network that is naturally ternary, and compression is achieved during training by a regularization term.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Generally, a contrasting aspect of our approach from the aforementioned literature is that the theory of optimal control, together with Theorem. 2, provide a theoretical basis for the development of our algorithms.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Nevertheless, further work is required to rigorously establish the convergence of these algorithms.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"We also mention a recent work (Yin et al., 2018) which analyzes quantized networks and develops algorithms based on relaxing the discrete-weight constraints into continuous regularizers.",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"Lastly, there are also analyses of quantized networks from a statistical-mechanical viewpoint (Baldassi et al., 2015; 2016a;b; 2017).",5. Discussion and Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper, we have introduced the discrete-time optimal control viewpoint of deep learning.",6. Conclusion and Outlook,[0],[0]
"In particular, the PMP and the MSA form an alternative theoretical and algorithmic basis for deep learning that may apply to broader contexts.",6. Conclusion and Outlook,[0],[0]
"As an application of our framework, we considered the training of binary and ternary neural networks, in which we develop effective algorithms based on optimal control.
",6. Conclusion and Outlook,[0],[0]
There are certainly many avenues of future work.,6. Conclusion and Outlook,[0],[0]
"An interesting mathematical question is the applicability of the PMP for discrete-weight neural networks, which does not satisfy the convexity assumptions in Theorem 1.",6. Conclusion and Outlook,[0],[0]
It will be desirable to find the condition under which rigorous statements can be made.,6. Conclusion and Outlook,[0],[0]
Another question is to establish the convergence of the algorithms presented.,6. Conclusion and Outlook,[0],[0]

"LDA models the corpus as a mixture of topics (aspects), and topics as distributions over word types.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['LDA models the corpus as a mixture of topics (aspects), and topics as distributions over word types.']"
"While the mixture of aspects discovered by LDA-based models may describe a corpus fairly well, we find that the individual aspects inferred are of poor quality – aspects often consist of unrelated or loosely-related concepts.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
This may substantially reduce users’ confidence in using such automated systems.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
There could be two primary reasons for the poor quality.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Conventional LDA models do not directly encode word co-occurrence statistics which are the primary source of information to preserve topic coherence (Mimno et al., 2011).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"They implicitly capture such patterns by modeling word generation from the document level, assuming that each word is generated independently.",1 Introduction,[1.0],"['They implicitly capture such patterns by modeling word generation from the document level, assuming that each word is generated independently.']"
"Furthermore, LDA-based models need to estimate a distribution of topics for each document.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Review documents tend to be short, thus making the estimation of topic distributions more difficult.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this work, we present a novel neural approach to tackle the weaknesses of LDA-based methods.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We start with neural word embeddings that al-
388
ready map words that usually co-occur within the same context to nearby points in the embedding space (Mikolov et al., 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We then filter the word embeddings within a sentence using an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and use the filtered words to construct aspect embeddings.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The training process for aspect embeddings is analogous to autoencoders, where we use dimension reduction to extract the common factors among embedded sentences and reconstruct each sentence through a linear combination of aspect embeddings.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The attention mechanism deemphasizes words that are not part of any aspect, allowing the model to focus on aspect words.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We call our proposed model Attention-based Aspect Extraction (ABAE).
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In contrast to LDA-based models, our proposed method explicitly encodes word-occurrence statistics into word embeddings, uses dimension reduction to extract the most important aspects in the review corpus, and uses an attention mechanism to remove irrelevant words to further improve coherence of the aspects.

We have conducted extensive experiments on large review data sets.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The results show that ABAE is effective in discovering meaningful and coherent aspects.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
It substantially outperforms baseline methods on multiple evaluation tasks.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]

It can also easily scale to a large amount of training data.,1 Introduction,[1.0],['It can also easily scale to a large amount of training data.']
"Therefore, it is a promising alternative to LDA-based methods proposed previously.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
The problem of aspect extraction has been well studied in the past decade.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Initially, methods were mainly based on manually defined rules.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Hu and Liu (2004) proposed to extract different product features through finding frequent nouns and noun phrases.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
They also extracted opinion terms by finding the synonyms and antonyms of opinion seed words through WordNet.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Following this, a number of methods have been proposed based on frequent item mining and dependency information to extract product aspects (Zhuang et al., 2006; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Qiu et al., 2011).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"These models heavily depend on predefined rules which work well only when the aspect terms are restricted to a small group of nouns.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Supervised learning approaches generally model aspect extraction as a standard sequence
labeling problem.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Jin and Ho (2009) and Li et al. (2010) proposed to use hidden Markov models (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF), respectively with a set of manually-extracted features.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"More recently, different neural models (Yin et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) were proposed to automatically learn features for CRF-based aspect extraction.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Rule-based models are usually not refined enough to categorize the extracted aspect terms.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, supervised learning requires large amounts of labeled data for training purposes.
",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Unsupervised approaches, especially topic models, have been proposed subsequently to avoid reliance on labeled data.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Generally, the outputs of those models are word distributions or rankings for each aspect.",2 Related Work,[0],[0]
Aspects are naturally obtained without separately performing extraction and categorization.,2 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Most existing works (Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Zhao et al., 2010; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Chen et al., 2014) are based on variants and extensions of LDA (Blei et al., 2003).",2 Related Work,[0],[0]

We begin by associating each word w in our vocabulary with a feature vector ew ∈ Rd.,3 Model Description,[0],[0]
"We use word embeddings for the feature vectors as word embeddings are designed to map words that often co-occur in a context to points that are close by in the embedding space (Mikolov et al., 2013).",3 Model Description,[0],[0]

"Then, we try to reconstruct the sentence embedding as a linear combination of aspect embeddings from T. This process of dimension reduction and reconstruction, where ABAE aims to transform sentence embeddings of the filtered sentences (zs) into their reconstructions (rs) with the least possible amount of distortion, preserves most of the information of the aspect words in the K embedded aspects.",3 Model Description,[0],[0]

"However, the aspect embedding matrix T may suffer from redundancy problems during training.",3.4 Regularization Term,[0],[0]

U reaches its minimum value when the dot product between any two different aspect embeddings is zero.,3.4 Regularization Term,[0],[0]
Thus the regularization term encourages orthogonality among the rows of the aspect embedding matrix T and penalizes redundancy between different aspect vectors.,3.4 Regularization Term,[0],[0]

"To do that, (1) we only used the single-label sentences for evaluation to avoid ambiguity (about 83% of labeled sentences have a single label), and (2) we only evaluated on three major aspects, namely Food, Staff, and Ambience.",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"The other aspects do not show clear patterns in either word usage or writing style, which makes these aspects very hard for even humans to identify.",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]

We make the following observations from Table 4: (1) ABAE outperforms all other models on F1 score for aspects Staff and Ambience.,5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
(2) The F1 score of ABAE for Food is worse than SERBM while its precision is very high.,5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
We analyzed the errors and found that most of the sentences we failed to recognize as Food are general descriptions without specific food words appearing.,5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"For example, the true label for the sentence “The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.”",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
is Food.,5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
ABAE assigns Staff to it as the highly focused words according to the attention mechanism are quickly and efficiently which are more related to Staff.,5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"In fact, although this sentence contains the word food, we think it is a rather general description of service.",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
(3) ABAE substantially outperforms k-means for this task although both methods perform well for extracting coherent aspects as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.,5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"This shows the power brought by the attention mechanism, which is able to capture the main topic of a sentence by only focusing on aspect-related words.
",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"For the beer domain, in addition to the five goldstandard aspect labels, we also combined Taste and Smell to form a single aspect – Taste+Smell.",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"This is because these two aspects are very similar
and many words can be used to describe both aspects.",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"For example, the words spicy, bitter, fresh, sweet, etc. are top ranked representative words in both aspects, which makes it very hard even for humans to distinguish them.",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"Since Taste and Smell are highly correlated and difficult to separate in real life, a natural way to evaluate is to treat them as a single aspect.
",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
"We can see from Table 5 that due to the issue described above, all models perform poorly on Taste and Smell.",5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
ABAE outperforms previous models in F1 scores on all aspects except for Taste.,5.2 Aspect Identification,[0],[0]
