"Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a key task in computational lexical semantics, inasmuch as it addresses the lexical ambiguity of text by making explicit the meaning of words occurring in a given context (Navigli, 2009).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Anyone who has struggled with frustratingly unintelligible translations from an automatic system, or with the meaning bias of search engines, can understand the importance for an intelligent system to go beyond the surface appearance of text.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
There are two mainstream lines of research in WSD: supervised and knowledge-based WSD.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Supervised WSD frames the problem as a classical machine learning task in which, first a training phase occurs aimed at learning a classification model from sentences annotated with word senses and, second the model is applied to previouslyunseen sentences focused on a target word.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A key
difference from many other problems, however, is that the classes to choose from (i.e., the senses of a target word) vary for each word, therefore requiring a separate training process to be performed on a word by word basis.",1 Introduction,[0.9532966937305704],"['For training such a network, referred to as a Q network in their paper, they generate each training example by either running beam search or using a ground-truth translation (when appropriate) for each source sentence.']"
"As a result, hundreds of training instances are needed for each ambiguous word in the vocabulary.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"This would necessitate a million-item training set to be manually created for each language of interest, an endeavour that is currently beyond reach even in resource-rich languages like English.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The second paradigm, i.e., knowledge-based WSD, takes a radically different approach: the idea is to exploit a general-purpose knowledge resource like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to develop an algorithm which can take advantage of the structural and lexical-semantic information in the resource to choose among the possible senses of a target word occurring in context.",1 Introduction,[0.9551768768874939],"['Related Work: Soothsayer prediction function Independently from and concurrently with our work here, Li et al. (2017) proposed, just two weeks earlier, to train a neural network that predicts an arbitrary decoding objective given a source sentence and a partial hypothesis, or a prefix of translation, and to use it as an auxiliary score in beam search.']"
"For example, a PageRank-based algorithm can be developed to determine the probability of a given sense being reached starting from the senses of its context words.",1 Introduction,[0.9527365696436514],"['This ensures the generality of the pretrained translation model, and allows us to train multiple trainable greedy decoding agents with different decoding objectives, maximizing the utility of a single trained translation model.']"
"Recent approaches of this kind have been shown to obtain competitive results (Agirre et al., 2014; Moro et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"However, due to its inherent nature, knowledge-based WSD tends to adopt bag-of-word approaches which do not exploit the local lexical context of a target word, including function and collocation words, which limits this approach in some cases.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this paper we get the best of both worlds and present Train-O-Matic, a novel method for generating huge high-quality training sets for all the words in a language’s vocabulary.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The approach is language-independent, thanks to its use of a multilingual knowledge resource, BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), and it can be applied to any kind of corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"The training sets produced with Train-O-Matic are shown to provide competitive performance with those of manually and semi-
78
automatically tagged corpora.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Moreover, state-ofthe-art performance is also reported for low resourced languages (i.e., Italian and Spanish) and domains, where manual training data is not available.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this Section we present Train-O-Matic, a language-independent approach to the automatic construction of a sense-tagged training set.",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"TrainO-Matic takes as input a corpus C (e.g., Wikipedia) and a semantic network G = (V,E).",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"We assume a WordNet-like structure of G, i.e., V is the set of concepts (i.e., synsets) such that, for each word w in the vocabulary, Senses(w) is the set of vertices in V that are expressed by w, e.g., the WordNet synsets that include w as one of their senses.
",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"Train-O-Matic consists of three steps:
• Lexical profiling: for each vertex in the semantic network, we compute its Personalized PageRank vector, which provides its lexicalsemantic profile (Section 2.1).
",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"• Sentence scoring: For each sentence containing a word w, we compute a probability distribution over all the senses of w based on its context (Section 2.2).
",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
"• Sentence ranking and selection: for each sense s of a word w in the vocabulary, we select those sentences that are most likely to use w in the sense of s (Section 2.3).",2 Building a Training Set from Scratch,[0],[0]
In terms of semantic networks the probability of reaching a node v′ starting from v can be interpreted as a measure of relatedness between the synsets v,2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
and v′.,2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"Thus we define the lexical profile of a vertex v in a graph G = (V,E) as the probability distribution over all the vertices v′ in the graph.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"Such distribution is computed by applying the Personalized PagaRank algorithm, a variant of the traditional PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998).",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"While the latter is equivalent to performing random walks with uniform restart probability on every vertex at each step, PPR, on the other hand, makes the restart probability non-uniform, thereby concentrating more probability mass in the surroundings of those vertices having higher restart
probability.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"Formally, (P)PR is computed as follows:
v(t+1) =",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"(1− α)v(0) + αMv(t) (1)
where M is the row-normalized adjacency matrix of the semantic network, the restart probability distribution is encoded by vector v(0), and α is the well-known damping factor usually set to 0.85 (Brin and Page, 1998).",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"If we set v(0) to a unit probability vector (0, . . .",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
", 0, 1, 0, . . .",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
", 0), i.e., restart is always on a given vertex, PPR outputs the probability of reaching every vertex starting from the restart vertex after a certain number of steps.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"This approach has been used in the literature to create semantic signatures (i.e., profiles) of individual concepts, i.e., vertices of the semantic network (Pilehvar et al., 2013), and then to determine the semantic similarity of concepts.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"As also done by Pilehvar and Collier (2016), we instead use the PPR vector as an estimate of the conditional probability of a word w′",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"given the target sense1 s ∈ V of word w:
P (w′|s, w) = maxs′∈Senses(w′) vs(s ′)
Z (2)
where Z = ∑
w” P (w”|s, w) is a normalization constant, vs is the vector resulting from an adequate number of random walks used to calculate PPR, and vs(s′) is the vector component corresponding to sense s′.",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
"To fix the number of iterations needed to have a sufficiently accurate vector, we follow Lofgren et al. (2014) and set the error δ = 0.00001 and the number of iterations to 1 δ = 100, 000.
",2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
As a result of this lexical profiling step we have a probability distribution over vocabulary words for each given word sense of interest.,2.1 Lexical profiling,[0],[0]
The objective of the second step is to score the importance of word senses for each of the corpus sentences which contain the word of interest.,2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]

"P (wi|s, w) is calculated as in Formula 2 and P (s|w) is set to 1/|Senses(w)| (recall that s is a sense of w).",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"For example, given the sentence σ =",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"“A match is a tool for starting a fire”, the target word w = match and its set of senses Smatch = {s1match, s2match}, where s1match is the sense of lighter and s2match is the sense of game match, we want to calculate the probability of each simatch ∈ Smatch of being the correct sense of match in the sentence σ.",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"Following Formula 5 we have:
P (s1match|σ,match)",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"≈ P (tool|s1match,match) · P (start|s1match,match) · P (fire|s1match,match) · P (s1match|match) = 2.1 · 10−4 · 2 · 10−3 · 10−2 · 5 · 10−1 = 2.1 · 10−9
P (s2match|σ,match)",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"≈ P (tool|s2match,match) ·",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"P (start|s2match,match) · P (fire|s2match,match) · P (s2match|match) = 10−5 · 2.9 · 10−4 · 10−6 · 5 · 10−1 = 1.45 · 10−15
As can be seen, the first sense of match has a much higher probability due to its stronger relatedness to the other words in the context (i.e. start, fire and tool).",2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
Note also that all the probabilities for the second sense are at least one magnitude less than the probability of the first sense.,2.2 Sentence scoring,[0],[0]
"Finally, for a given word w and a given sense s1 ∈ Senses(w), we score each sentence σ in which w appears and s1 is its most likely sense according to a formula that takes into account the difference between the first (i.e., s1) and the second most likely sense of w in σ:

"= P (s1|σ,w)− P (s2|σ,w) (6) where s1 = arg maxs∈Senses(w) P (s|σ,w), and s2 = arg maxs∈Senses(w)\{s1} P (s|σ,w).",2.3 Sense-based sentence ranking and selection,[0],[0]
We then sort all sentences based on ∆s1(·) and return a ranked list of sentences where word w is most likely to be sense-annotated with s1.,2.3 Sense-based sentence ranking and selection,[0],[0]
"Although we recognize that other scoring strategies could have been used, this was experimentally the most effective one when compared to alternative strategies, i.e., the sense probability, the number of words related to the target word w, the sentence length or a combination thereof.",2.3 Sense-based sentence ranking and selection,[0],[0]
"In the previous Section we assumed that WordNet was our semantic network, with synsets as vertices and edges represented by its semantic relations.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"However, while its lexical coverage is high, with a rich set of fine-grained synsets, at the relation level WordNet provides mainly paradigmatic information, i.e., relations like hypernymy (is-a) and meronymy (part-of).",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"It lacks, on the other hand, syntagmatic relations, such as those that connect verb synsets to their arguments (e.g., the appropriate senses of eatv and foodn), or pairs of noun synsets (e.g., the appropriate senses of busn and drivern).
",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Intuitively, Train-O-Matic would suffer from such a lack of syntagmatic relations, as the relevance of a sense for a given word in a sentence depends directly on the possibility of visiting senses of the other words in the same sentence (cf.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
Formula 5) via random walks as calculated with Formula 1.,3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
Such reachability depends on the connections available between synsets.,3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Because syntagmatic relations are sparse in WordNet, if it was used on its own, we would end up with a poor ranking of sentences for any given word sense.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Moreover, even though the methodology presented in Section 2 is languageindependent, Train-O-Matic would lack informa-
tion (e.g. senses for a word in an arbitrary vocabulary) for languages other than English.
",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"To cope with these issues, we exploit BabelNet,2 a huge multilingual semantic network obtained from the automatic integration of WordNet, Wikipedia, Wiktionary and other resources (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012), and create the BabelNet subgraph induced by the WordNet vertices.",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
The result is a graph whose vertices are BabelNet synsets that contain at least one WordNet synset and whose edge set includes all those relations in BabelNet coming either from WordNet itself or from links in other resources mapped to WordNet (such as hyperlinks in a Wikipedia article connecting it to other articles).,3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"The greatest contribution of syntagmatic relations comes, indeed, from Wikipedia, as its articles are linked to related articles (e.g., the English Wikipedia Bus article3 is linked to Passenger, Tourism, Bus lane, Timetable, School, and many more).
",3 Creating a Denser and Multilingual Semantic Network,[0],[0]
"Because not all Wikipedia (and other resources’) pages are connected with the same degree of relatedness (e.g., countries are often linked, but they are not necessarily closely related to the source article in which the link occurs), we apply the following weighting strategy to each edge (s, s′) ∈ E of our WordNet-induced subgraph of BabelNet G = (V,E):

"Comparison sense-annotated corpora To show the impact of our T-O-M corpora in WSD, we compared its performance on the above gold standard datasets, against training with:
• SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), a corpus containing about 226,000 words annotated manually with WordNet senses.

"• One Million Sense-Tagged Instances (Taghipour and Ng, 2015, OMSTI), a sense-annotated dataset obtained via a semi-automatic approach based on the disambiguation of a parallel corpus, i.e., the United Nations Parallel Corpus, performed by exploiting manually translated word senses.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Because OMSTI integrates SemCor
to increase coverage, to keep a level playing field we excluded the latter from the corpus.
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We note that T-O-M, instead, is fully automatic and does not require any WSD-specific human intervention nor any aligned corpus.
Reference system In all our experiments, we used It Makes Sense (Zhong and Ng, 2010, IMS), a state-of-the-art WSD system based on linear Support Vector Machines, as our reference system for comparing its performance when trained on TO-M, against the same WSD system trained on other sense-annotated corpora (i.e., SemCor and OMSTI).",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"Following the WSD literature, unless stated otherwise, we report performance in terms of F1, i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]
"We note that it is not the purpose of this paper to show that T-O-M, when integrated into IMS, beats all other configurations or alternative systems, but rather to fully automatize the WSD pipeline with performances which are competitive with the state of the art.

"As a traditional baseline in WSD, we used the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline given by the first sense in WordNet.",4 Experimental Setup,[0],[0]

Similar performance losses were observed when using T-O-MUN (see Table 3).,5.1 Impact of syntagmatic relations,[0],[0]
This corroborates our hunch discussed in Section 3 that a resource like BabelNet can contribute important syntagmatic relations that are beneficial for identifying (and ranking high) sentences which are semantically relevant for the target word sense.,5.1 Impact of syntagmatic relations,[0],[0]

"The MFS is in the same ballpark as T-O-MWiki, performing better on some datasets and worse on others.",5.2 Comparison against sense-annotated corpora,[0],[0]

"We view this as a significant achievement given the total absence of manual effort involved in T-O-M.

"IMS uses the MFS as a backoff strategy when no sense can be output for a target word in context (Zhong and Ng, 2010).",5.3 Performance without backoff strategy,[0],[0]

"T-O-M performances, instead, remain high in terms of precision, recall and F1.",5.3 Performance without backoff strategy,[0],[0]
"This confirms that OMSTI relies heavily on data (those obtained for the MFS and from SemCor) that are produced manually, rather than semi-automatically.",5.3 Performance without backoff strategy,[0],[0]
"To further inspect the ability of T-O-M to enable disambiguation in different domains, we decided to evaluate on specific documents from the various gold standard datasets which could be clearly assigned a domain label.",5.4 Domain-oriented WSD,[0],[0]
"Specifically, we tested on 13 SemEval-13 documents from various domains6 and 2 SemEval-15 documents (namely, maths & computers, and biomedicine) and carried out two separate tests and evaluations of T-O-M on each domain: once using the MFS backoff strategy, and once not using it.",5.4 Domain-oriented WSD,[0],[0]

"Thanks to BabelNet, in fact, Train-O-Matic can

"Thus, in order to build new training datasets for the two languages, we ran Train-O-Matic on their corresponding versions of Wikipedia, then we tuned the two parameters K and z on an in-house development dataset7.",6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
"In contrast to the English setting, in order to calculate Formula 8 we sorted the senses of each word by vertex degree.",6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
"Finally we used the output data to train IMS.
Results To perform our evaluation we chose the most recent multilingual task (SemEval 2015 task 13) which includes gold data for Italian and Spanish.",6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
"As can be seen from Table 8 TrainO-Matic enabled IMS to perform better than the best participating system (Manion and Sainudiin, 2014, SUDOKU) in all three settings (All domains, Maths & Computer and Biomedicine).",6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
"Its performance was in fact, 1 to 3 points higher, with a 6-point peak on Maths & Computer in Spanish and on Biomedicine in Italian.",6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
This demonstrates the ability of Train-O-Matic to enable supervised WSD systems to surpass state-of-theart knowledge-based WSD approaches in lowresourced languages without relying on manually curated data for training.,6 Scaling up to Multiple Languages,[0],[0]
There are two mainstream approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation: supervised and knowledge-based approaches.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]

"The main difference from our approach is its need for a manually annotated dataset to start the label propagation algorithm, whereas Train-O-Matic is fully automatic.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"An evaluation against this system would have been interesting, but neither the proprietary training data nor the code are available at the time of writing.
",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In order to generalize effectively, these supervised systems require large numbers of training in-
stances annotated with senses for each target word occurrence.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Overall, this amounts to millions of training instances for each language of interest, a number that is not within reach for any language.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In fact, no supervised system has been submitted in major multilingual WSD competitions for languages other than English (Navigli et al., 2013; Moro and Navigli, 2015).",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"To overcome this problem, new methodologies have recently been developed which aim to create sense-tagged corpora automatically.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
Raganato et al. (2016) developed 7 heuristics to grow the number of hyperlinks in Wikipedia pages.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Otegi et al. (2016) applied a different disambiguation pipeline for each language to parallel text in Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and QTLeap (Agirre et al., 2015) in order to enrich them with semantic annotations.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Taghipour and Ng (2015), the work closest to ours, exploits the alignment from English to Chinese sentences of
the United Nation Parallel Corpus (Ziemski et al., 2016) to reduce the ambiguity of English words and sense-tag English sentences.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
The assumption is that the second language is less ambiguous than the first one and that hand-made translations of senses are available for each WordNet synset.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"This approach is, therefore, semi-automatic and relies on certain assumptions, in contrast to TrainO-Matic which is, instead, fully automatic and can be applied to any kind of corpus (and language) depending on the specific need.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
Earlier attempts at the automatic extraction of training samples were made by Agirre and De Lacalle (2004) and Fernández et al. (2004).,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Both exploited the monosemous relatives method (Leacock et al., 1998) in order to retrieve sentences from the Web which contained a given monosemous noun or a relative monosemous word (e.g., a synonym, a hypernym, etc.).",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"As can be seen in (Fernández et al., 2004)",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"this approach can lead to the retrieval of very accurate examples, but its main drawback lies in the number of senses covered.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In fact, for all those synsets that do not have any monosemous relative, the system is unable to retrieve examples, thus heavily affecting the performance in terms of recall and F1.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Knowledge-based WSD, instead, bypasses the heavy requirement of sense-annotated corpora by applying algorithms that exploit a general-purpose semantic network, such as WordNet, which encodes the relational information that interconnects synsets via different kinds of relation.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Approaches include variants of Personalized PageRank (Agirre et al., 2014) and densest subgraph approximation algorithms (Moro et al., 2014) which, thanks to the availability of multilingual resources such as BabelNet, can easily be extended to perform WSD in arbitrary languages.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
Other approaches to knowledge-based WSD exploit the definitional knowledge contained in a dictionary.,7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986) and its variants (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002; Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000; Vasilescu et al., 2004) aim to determine the correct sense of a word by comparing each wordsense definition with the context in which the target word appears.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"The limit of knowledge-based WSD, however, lies in the absence of mechanisms that can take into account the very local context of a target word occurrence, including non-content words such as prepositions and articles.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, recent studies seem to suggest that such
approaches are barely able to surpass supervised WSD systems when they enrich their networks starting from a comparable amount of annotated data (Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014).",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"With T-O-M, rather than further enriching an existing semantic network, we exploit the information available in the network to annotate raw sentences with sense information and train a state-of-the-art supervised WSD system without task-specific human annotations.",7 Related Work,[0],[0]
"In this paper we presented Train-O-Matic, a novel approach to the automatic construction of large training sets for supervised WSD in an arbitrary language.",8 Conclusion,[0],[0]

"T-O-M was shown to provide training data for virtually all the target ambiguous nouns, in marked contrast to alternatives like OMSTI, which covers in many cases around half of the tokens, resorting to the MFS otherwise.",8 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"Moreover Train-O-Matic has proven to scale well to lowresourced languages, for which no manually annotated dataset exists, surpassing the current state of the art of knowledge-based systems.

"We believe that the ability of T-O-M to overcome the current paucity of annotated data for WSD, coupled with video games with a purpose for validation purposes (Jurgens and Navigli, 2014; Vannella et al., 2014), paves the way for high-quality multilingual supervised WSD.",8 Conclusion,[0],[0]
"All the training corpora, including approximately one million sentences which cover English, Italian and Spanish, are made available to the community at http://trainomatic.org.

Neural machine translation has recently become a method of choice in machine translation research.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Besides its success in traditional settings of machine translation, that is one-to-one translation between two languages, (Sennrich et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2016), neural machine translation has ventured into more sophisticated settings of machine translation.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"For instance, neural machine translation has successfully proven itself to be capable of
handling subword-level representation of sentences (Lee et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016; Sennrich et al., 2015; Costa-Jussa and Fonollosa, 2016; Ling et al., 2015).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Furthermore, several research groups have shown its potential in seamlessly handling multiple languages (Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a; Firat et al., 2016a,b; Lee et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016; Viégas et al., 2016).

A typical scenario of neural machine translation starts with training a model to maximize its log-likelihood.,1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"That is, we often train a model to maximize the conditional probability of a reference translation given a source sentence over a large parallel corpus.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Once the model is trained in this way, it defines the conditional distribution over all possible translations given a source sentence, and the task of translation becomes equivalent to finding a translation to which the model assigns the highest conditional probability.",1 Introduction,[0.9518540256307167],"['This approach allows one to use an arbitrary decoding objective, but it still re- lies heavily on the log-probability of the underlying neural translation system in actual decoding.']"
"Since it is computationally intractable to do so exactly, it is a usual practice to resort to approximate search/decoding algorithms such as greedy decoding or beam search.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"In this scenario, we have identified two points where improvements could be made.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"They are (1) training (including the selection of a model architecture) and (2) decoding.
",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Much of the research on neural machine translation has focused solely on the former, that is, on improving the model architecture.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"Neural machine translation started with with a simple encoderdecoder architecture in which a source sentence is encoded into a single, fixed-size vector (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"It soon evolved with the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"A few variants of the attention mechanism, or its regularization, have been proposed recently to improve both the translation quality as well as the computational efficiency (Luong et al., 2015b; Cohn et al., 2016; Tu et al., 2016b).",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"More recently, convolutional net-

"On the aspect of decoding, only a few research groups have tackled this problem by incorporating a target decoding algorithm into training.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]

"More specifically, we introduce a neural-network-based decoding algorithm that works on an already-trained neural machine translation system by observing and manipulating its hidden state.",1 Introduction,[0],[0]
"We treat such a neural network as an agent with a deterministic, continuous action and train it with a variant of the deterministic policy gradient algorithm (Silver et al., 2014).

"This time-dependent representation et is often implemented as a recurrent network encoder of the source sentence coupled with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014).

It is important to note that this maximum likelihood learning does not take into account how a trained model would be used.,2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]
"Rather, it is only concerned with learning a distribution over all possible translations.",2.1 Neural Machine Translation,[0],[0]

"This is, however, computationally intractable, and it is a usual practice to resort to approximate decoding algorithms.

Greedy Decoding One such approximate decoding algorithm is greedy decoding.,2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
"In greedy decoding, we follow the conditional dependency path and pick the symbol with the highest conditional probability so far at each node.",2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]
This is equivalent to picking the best symbol one at a time from left to right in conditional language modelling.,2.2 Decoding,[0],[0]

Despite its preferable computational complexity O(|V | × T ), greedy decoding has been over time found to be undesirably sub-optimal.

"First, each potential scenario in which neural machine translation is used calls for a unique decoding objective.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"In simultaneous translation/interpretation, which has recently been studied in the context of neural machine translation (Gu et al., 2016), the decoding objective is formulated as a trade-off between the translation quality and delay.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, when a machine translation system is used as a part of a larger information
extraction system, it is more important to correctly translate named entities and events than to translate syntactic function words.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"The decoding objective in this case must account for how the translation is used in subsequent modules in a larger system.
",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"Second, the conditional probability assigned by a trained neural machine translation model does not necessarily reflect our perception of translation quality.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"Although Cho (2016) provided empirical evidence of high correlation between the logprobability and BLEU, a de facto standard metric in machine translation, there have also been reports on large mismatch between the log-probability and BLEU.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]

",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"In short, there is a significant need for designing multiple decoding algorithms for neural machine translation, regardless of how it was trained.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
It is however non-trivial to manually design a new decoding algorithm with an arbitrary objective.,3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]
"This is especially true with neural machine translation, as the underlying structure of the decoding/search process – the high-dimensional hidden state of a recurrent network – is accessible but not interpretable.",3.1 Many Decoding Objectives,[0],[0]

"We start from the noisy, parallel approximate decoding (NPAD) algorithm proposed in (Cho, 2016).",3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]
The main idea behind NPAD algorithm is that a better translation with a higher log-probability may be found by injecting unstructured noise in the transition function of a recurrent network.,3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[1.0],['The main idea behind NPAD algorithm is that a better translation with a higher log-probability may be found by injecting unstructured noise in the transition function of a recurrent network.']

NPAD avoids potential degradation of translation quality by running such a noisy greedy decoding process multiple times in parallel.,3.2 Trainable Greedy Decoding,[0],[0]

Challenges The most apparent challenge for training such a deterministic actor with a large action space is that most of action configurations will lead to zero return.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[1.0],['Challenges The most apparent challenge for training such a deterministic actor with a large action space is that most of action configurations will lead to zero return.']
It is also not trivial to devise an efficient exploration strategy with a deterministic actor with real-valued actions.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]

"Although this property of dense reward makes the problem of trainable greedy decoding more manageable, we have observed other issues during our preliminary experiment with the vanilla deterministic policy gradient.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]

"In order to do so, the critic must be trained, or presented, with stateaction sequences z1:T ′ similar though not identical to the state-action sequence generated by the current actor π.",4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]

We have however observed that the quality of the reward and its gradient estimate of the critic is very noisy even when the critic was trained with this kind of noisy actor.,4.2 Critic-Aware Actor Learning,[0],[0]

"All the corpora are tokenized and segmented into subword symbols using byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015).",5 Experimental Settings,[0],[0]

Both the size of GRU units and embedding vectors are the same with the underlying model.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"Unlike a usual neural machine translation system, the critic does not language-model the target sentence but simply outputs a scalar value to predict the true return.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"When we predict a bounded return, such as sentence BLEU, we use a sigmoid activation at the output.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"For other unbounded return like perplexity, we use a linear activation.

Learning We train the actor and critic simultaneously by alternating between updating the actor and critic.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"As the quality of the critic’s approximation of the decoding objective has direct influence on the actor’s learning, we make ten updates to the critic before each time we update the actor once.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]

"First, we demonstrate that it is possible to build multiple trainable decoders with a single underlying model trained using maximum likelihood learning.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"Second, the comparison between these two objectives provides a glimpse into the relationship between BLEU (the most widely used automatic metric for evaluating translation systems) and log-likelihood (the most widely used learning criterion for neural machine translation).

Evaluation We test the trainable greedy decoder with both greedy decoding and beam search.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"Although our decoder is always trained with greedy decoding, beam search in practice can be used together with the actor of the trainable greedy decoder.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
Beam search is expected to work better especially when our training of the trainable greedy decoder is unlikely to be optimal.,5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
"In both cases, we report both the perplexity and BLEU.",5.1 Model Architectures and Learning,[0],[0]
We present the improvements of BLEU and perplexity (or its negation) in Fig. 2 for all the language pair-directions.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
It is clear from these plots that the best result is achieved when the trainable greedy decoder was trained to maximize the target decoding objective.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"When the decoder was trained to maximize sentence-level BLEU, we see the improvement in BLEU but often the degradation in the perplexity (see the left plots in Fig. 2.)",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"On the other hand, when the actor was trained to minimize the perplexity, we only see the improvement in per-
plexity (see the right plots in Fig. 2.)",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This confirms our earlier claim that it is necessary and desirable to tune for the target decoding objective regardless of what the underlying translation system was trained for, and strongly supports the proposed idea of trainable decoding.
",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"The improvement from using the proposed trainable greedy decoding is smaller when used together with beam search, as seen in Fig. 2 (b).",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"However, we still observe statistically significant improvement in terms of BLEU (marked with red stars.)",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This suggests a future direction in which we extend the proposed trainable greedy decoding to directly incorporate beam search into its training procedure to further improve the translation quality.
",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
It is worthwhile to note that we achieved all of these improvements with negligible computational overhead.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"This is due to the fact that our actor is a very small, shallow neural network, and that the more complicated critic is thrown away after training.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
We suspect the effectiveness of such a small actor is due to the well-structured hidden state space of the underlying neural machine translation model which was trained with a large amount of parallel corpus.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We believe this favourable computational complexity makes the proposed method suitable for production-grade neural machine translation (Wu et al., 2016; Crego et al., 2016).

"Importance of Critic-Aware Actor Learning In Fig. 3, we show sample learning curves with and without the proposed critic-aware actor learning.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Both curves were from the models trained under the same condition.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Despite a slower start in the early stage of learning, we see that the critic-aware actor learning has greatly stabilized the learning progress.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We emphasize that we would not have been able to train all these 16 actors without the proposed critic-aware actor learning.
",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"Examples In Fig. 4, we present three examples from Ru-En.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We defined the influence as the KL divergence between the conditional distributions without the trainable greedy decoding and with the trainable greedy decoding, assuming the fixed previous hidden state and target symbol.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
"We colored a target word with magenta, when the influence of the trainable greedy decoding is large (> 0.001).",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
Manual inspection of these examples as well as others has revealed that the trainable greedy decoder focuses on fixing prepositions and removing any unnecessary symbol generation.,5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]

analysis is however left as future work.",5.2 Results and Analysis,[0],[0]
